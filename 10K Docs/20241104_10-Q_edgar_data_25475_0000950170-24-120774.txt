NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLID ATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 Unaudited 
 
 Based in Atlanta, Georgia, Crawford Company ("Crawford" or "the Company") is a leading provider of claims management and outsourcing solutions to insurance companies and self-insured entities with an expansive global network serving clients in more than 70 countries. 
 Shares of the Company's two classes of common stock are traded on the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") under the symbols CRD-A and CRD-B, respectively. The Company's two classes of stock are substantially identical, except with respect to voting rights for the Class B Common Stock (CRD-B), and protections for the non-voting Class A Common Stock (CRD-A). More information is available on the Company's website www.crawco.com . The information contained on, or hyperlinked from, the Company's website is not a part of, and is not incorporated by reference into, this report. 

The Company has four reportable segments consisting of North America Loss Adjusting, International Operations, Broadspire, and Platform Solutions. Significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , the liabilities of the deferred compensation plan were and , respectively, which represented obligations of the Company rather than of the rabbi trust, and the values of the assets held in the related rabbi trust were and , respectively. These liabilities and assets are included in "Other noncurrent liabilities" and "Other noncurrent assets," respectively, on the Company's unaudited Condens ed Consolidated Balance Sheets. 

11 

. The Company's North America Loss Adjusting and International Operations segments generate revenue for adjusting services provided to insurance companies and self-insured entities related to property and casualty losses caused by physical damage to commercial and residential real property and certain types of personal property. These segments also generate revenues for claims management services provided to insurance companies and self-insured entities related to large, complex losses with technical adjusting and industry experts servicing a broad range of industries. The Company charges on a fee-per-claim basis for each optional purchase of the claims management services exercised by its customer. The Company also performs Legal Services within its International Operations segment. Revenue is recognized over time as the performance obligations are satisfied through the effort expended to research, investigate, evaluate, document and report the claim and control of these services is transferred to the customer. Revenue is recognized based on the claim type for fixed fee claims applied utilizing a portfolio approach based on time elapsed for these claims. For claims billed on a time and expense incurred basis, which are considered variable consideration, the Company recognizes revenue at the amount in which it has the right to invoice for services performed. These methods of revenue recognition are the most accurate depiction of the transfer of the claims management services to the customer. Task assignment services are single optional purchase performance obligations which are generally satisfied at a point in time when the control of the service is transferred to the customer. Therefore, revenue is recognized when the customer receives the service requested.

The Company s Broadspire segment is a third party administrator that generates revenue through its Claims Management and Medical Management service lines. The Claims Management service line includes Workers' Compensation, Liability, Property and Disability Claims Management. This service line also performs additional services such as Accident Health claims programs, including Affinity type claims, and disability and leave management services. Each claim referred by the customer is considered an additional optional purchase of claims management services under the agreement with the customer. The transaction price is specified in the contract and is fixed for each service. Revenue is recognized over time as services are provided as the performance obligations are satisfied through the effort expended to research, investigate, evaluate, document, and report the claim and control of these services is transferred to the customer. Revenue is recognized based on historical claim closure rates and claim type applied utilizing a portfolio approach based on time elapsed for these claims as the Company believes this is the most accurate depiction of the transfer of claims management services to its customer. Broadspire also provides claims management services on a monthly basis for which revenue is recognized over time monthly based on claims received and staff required to complete our claim handling obligations. Broadspire also provides Risk Management Information Services and Account Administration Services and generates revenues from income earned for managing funds maintained to administer claims for its customers. For non-claim services provided in our Claims Management service line, revenue is recognized over time as services are provided and control of these services is transferred to the customer. Revenue is recognized as time elapses as this is the most accurate depiction of the transfer of the service to the customer. The Company's obligation to manage claims under the Claims Management service line can range from less than , on a one- or basis or for the lifetime of the claim. Under certain claims management agreements, the Company receives consideration from a customer at contract inception prior to transferring services to the customer, however, it would begin performing services immediately. The period between a customer s payment of consideration and the completion of the promised services could be greater than one year. There is no difference between the amount of promised consideration and the cash selling price of the promised services. The fee is billed upfront by the Company in order to provide customers with simplified and predictable ways of purchasing its services and it is customary to invoice service fees when the claim is assigned. The Company considered whether a significant financing component exists and determined that there is not a significant financing component at the contract level. The Medical Management service line offers case managers who provide administration services by proactively managing medical treatment plans for claimants while facilitating an understanding of and participation in their rehabilitation process. Revenue for Medical Management services is recognized over time as the performance obligations are satisfied through the effort expended to manage the medical treatment for claimants and control of these services is transferred to the customer. Medical Management services are generally billed based on time incurred, are considered variable consideration, and revenue is recognized at the amount in which the Company has the right to invoice for services performed. This method of revenue recognition is the most accurate depiction of the transfer of the Medical Management services to the customer. The Company also performs medical bill review services. Medical bill review services provide an analysis of medical charges for clients claims to identify opportunities for savings. Medical bill review services revenues are recognized over time as control of the service is transferred to the customer. Revenue is recognized based upon the transfer of the results of the medical bill review service to the customer as this is the most accurate depiction of the transfer of the service to the customer.

The Company's Platform Solutions segment principally generates revenues through its Contractor Connection, Networks and Subrogation service lines. The Contractor Connection service line generates revenue through its independently managed contractor network. Contractor Connection primarily generates revenue by receiving a fee for each project that is sold by its network of contractors. Revenue is recognized at a point in time once the consumer accepts the contractor's proposal as Contractor Connection s performance obligation of referring projects to its contractors has been completed and the Company is entitled to consideration at that time. The contractor takes control of the service upon the consumer s acceptance of the contractor s proposal. The Networks service line generates revenues for claims management services provided to insurance companies and self-insured entities related to property, casualty and catastrophic losses. Networks also generates revenue by providing on-demand inspection, verification and other task specific field services for businesses and consumers. Revenue is recognized over time as the performance obligations are satisfied through the effort expended to research, investigate, evaluate, document and report the claim and control of these services is transferred to the customer. Revenue is recognized based on the claim type for fixed fee claims, applied based on time elapsed for these claims. For claims billed on a time and expense incurred basis, which are considered variable consideration, the Company recognizes revenue at the amount in which it has the right to invoice for services performed. These methods of revenue recognition are the most accurate depiction of the transfer of the claims management services to the customer. The Subrogation service line provides subrogation recovery and consultative services for the property and casualty insurance industry. Revenue is recognized at a point in time when the subrogation is successful and cash consideration is received.

In the normal course of business, the Company's segments incur certain out-of-pocket expenses that are thereafter reimbursed by its customers. The Company controls the promised good or service before it is transferred to its customer, therefore it is a principal in the transaction. These out-of-pocket expenses and associated reimbursements are reported on a gross basis within expenses and revenues, respectively, in the Company's unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. Claims Management Performance Obligations For claims management services, the Company typically has one performance obligation; however, it also provides the customer with an option to acquire additional services. The Company sells multiple lines of claims processing and different levels of processing depending on the complexity of the claims. The Company typically provides a menu of offerings from which the customer chooses to purchase at its option. The price of each service is separate and distinct and provides a separate and distinct value to the customer. Pricing is consistent for each service irrespective of the other services or quantities requested by the customer. For example, if the Company provides claims processing for both auto and general liability, those services are priced and delivered independently. These additional services represent optional purchases of additional claims management services and do not represent arrangements with multiple performance obligations. 

 14 

. When the Company receives consideration from a customer prior to transferring services to the customer under the terms of certain claims management agreements, it records deferred revenues on its unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, which represents a contract liability. These fixed-fee service agreements typically result from the Broadspire segment and require the Company to handle claims on either a one- or basis, or for the lifetime of the claim. In cases where it handles a claim on a non-lifetime basis, the Company typically receives an additional fee on each anniversary date that the claim remains open. For service agreements where it provides services for the life of the claim, the Company is paid one upfront fee regardless of the duration of the claim. The Company recognizes deferred revenues as revenues as it performs services and transfers control of the services to the customer and satisfies the performance obligation which it determines utilizing a portfolio approach. . De ferred revenues for lifetime claim handling are more sensitive to changes in claim closing rates since the Company is obligated to handle these claims to conclusion with no additional fees received for long-lived claims. Deferred revenues related to lifetime claim handling arrangements approximated and as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. For all fixed fee service agreements, revenues are recognized over the expected service periods by type of claim. Based upon its historical averages, the Company closes approximately of all cases referred to it under lifetime claim service agreements within from the date of referral. Also, within that five-year period, the percentage of cases remaining open in any one particular year has remained relatively consistent from period to period. Each quarter the Company evaluates its historical case closing rates by type of claim utilizing a portfolio approach and adjusts deferred revenues as necessary. As a portfolio approach is utilized to recognize deferred revenues, any changes in estimates will impact the timing of revenue recognition and any changes in estimates are recognized in the period in which they are determined.

Remaining performance obligations consist of deferred revenues as well as certain unbilled receivables where the claims processing has not yet occurred. The Company expects to recognize approximately 67 of its re maining performance obligations as revenues within and the remaining balance thereafter. Costs to Obtain a Contract The Company has a sales incentive compensation program where payment is based on the revenues recognized in the period. The payment does not represent an incremental cost to the Company that provides a future benefit expected to be longer than one year and would meet the criteria to be capitalized and presented as a contract asset on the Company's unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Practical Expedients Elected As a practical expedient, the Company does not adjust the consideration in a contract for the effects of a significant financing component it expects, at contract inception, when the period between a customer s payment of consideration and the transfer of promised services to the customer will be or less. For claims management services that are billed on a time and expense incurred or per unit basis, the Company recognizes revenue at the amount to which it has the right to invoice for services performed. The Company does not disclose the value of remaining performance obligations for (i) contracts for which it recognizes revenue at the amount to which it has the right to invoice for services performed, or (ii) contracts with variable consideration allocated entirely to a single performance obligation.

 and in the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, related to the fair value adjustment of earnout liabilities. The fair value of the contingent earnout liability is included in "Other accrued liabilities" and "Other noncurrent liabilities" on the Company's unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, based upon the term of the contingent earnout agreement. Fair Value Disclosures There were transfers of assets between fair value levels during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. The categorization of assets and liabilities within the fair value hierarchy and the measurement techniques are reviewed quarterly. Any transfers between levels are deemed to have occurred at the end of the quarter. The fair values of accounts receivable, unbilled revenues, accounts payable and short-term borrowings approximate their respective carrying values due to the short-term maturities of the instruments. The interest rate on the Company's variable rate long-term debt resets at least every ; therefore, the recorded value approximates fair value. Nonrecurring Fair Value Disclosures Goodwill is an asset that represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the separately identifiable net assets (tangible and intangible) acquired in certain business combinations. Indefinite-lived intangible assets consist of trade names associated with acquired businesses. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized but are subject to impairment testing at least annually. Other long-lived assets consist primarily of property and equipment, capitalized software, and amortizable intangible assets related to customer relationships, technology, and trade names with finite lives. Other long-lived assets are evaluated for impairment when impairment indicators are identified. Goodwill is tested for impairment on October 1st of each year, or between annual impairment tests, if events or circumstances have occurred which indicate potential impairment of goodwill. When testing for impairment, the carrying value of each reporting unit, including goodwill, is compared with the estimated fair value of the respective reporting unit as determined utilizing a combination of the income and market approaches and is classified in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.

. In the normal course of its business, the Company is sometimes named as a defendant or responsible party in suits or other actions by insureds or claimants contesting decisions made by the Company or its clients with respect to the settlement of claims. Additionally, certain clients of the Company have in the past brought, and may, in the future bring, claims for indemnification on the basis of alleged actions by the Company, its agents, or its employees in rendering services to clients. The majority of these claims are of the type covered by insurance maintained by the Company. However, the Company is responsible for the deductibles and self-insured retentions under various insurance coverages. In the opinion of Company management, adequate provisions have been made for such known and foreseeable risks. However, given the inherent unpredictability of litigation and disputes related to these matters, it is possible an adverse outcome or settlement, if not covered by insurance, could have a material effect on the Company's results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.

Report of Independent Regis tered Public Accounting Firm 
 To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of Crawford Company 
 Results of Review of Interim Financial Statements 
 We have reviewed the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet of Crawford Company (the Company) as of September 30, 2024, the related condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the condensed consolidated statements of shareholders' investment for the three-month periods ended March 31, June 30 and September 30, 2024 and 2023, the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the condensed consolidated interim financial statements ). Based on our reviews, we are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to the condensed consolidated interim financial statements for them to be in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 
 We have previously audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheet of the Company as of December 31, 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, shareholders investment and cash flows for the year then ended, and the related notes (not presented herein); and in our report dated March 4, 2024, we expressed an unqualified audit opinion on those consolidated financial statements. In our opinion, the information set forth in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2023, is fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the consolidated balance sheet from which it has been derived. 
 Basis for Review Results 
 These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the SEC and the PCAOB. We conducted our review in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. A review of interim financial statements consists principally of applying analytical procedures and making inquiries of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters. It is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB, the objective of which is the expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements taken as a whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion.

Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements 
 This report contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of that term in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Statements contained in this report that are not statements of historical fact are forward-looking statements made pursuant to the "safe harbor" provisions thereof. These statements may relate to, among other things, our expected future operating results and financial condition, our ability to grow our revenues and reduce our operating expenses, expectations regarding our anticipated contributions to our underfunded defined benefit pension plans, collectability of our billed and unbilled accounts receivable, financial results from our recently completed acquisitions, our continued compliance with the financial and other covenants contained in our financing agreements, and our other long-term capital resource and liquidity requirements. These statements may also relate to our business strategies, goals and expectations concerning our market position, future operations, margins, case and project volumes, profitability, contingencies, liquidity position, and capital resources. The words "anticipate", "believe", "could", "would", "should", "estimate", "expect", "intend", "may", "plan", "goal", "strategy", "predict", "project", "will" and similar terms and phrases, or the negatives thereof, identify forward-looking statements contained in this report. 
 Although we believe the assumptions upon which these forward-looking statements are based are reasonable, any of these assumptions could prove to be inaccurate and the forward-looking statements based on these assumptions could be incorrect. Our operations and the forward-looking statements related to our operations involve risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside our control, and any one of which, or a combination of which, could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations, and whether the forward-looking statements ultimately prove to be correct. Included among the risks and uncertainties we face are risks related to the following: 
 a decline in cases referred to us for any reason, including changes in the degree to which property and casualty insurance carriers outsource their claims handling functions, 

changes in global economic conditions, 

the impact of changing climate conditions, 

changes in interest rates, 

changes in foreign currency exchange rates, 

changes in regulations and practices of various governmental authorities, 

changes in our competitive environment, 

changes in the financial condition of our clients, 

changes in the rate of inflation and our ability to recover increased operating costs, 

the loss of any material customer, 

our ability to successfully integrate the operations of acquired businesses, 

our ability to timely identify and effectively remediate material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting, 

regulatory changes related to funding of defined benefit pension plans, 

our U.S., U.K. and other international defined benefit pension plans and our future funding obligations thereunder, 

our ability to complete any transaction involving the acquisition or disposition of assets on terms and at times acceptable to us, 

our ability to identify new revenue sources not tied to the insurance underwriting cycle, 

our ability to develop or acquire information technology resources to support and grow our business, 

our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel, 

our ability to renew existing contracts with clients on satisfactory terms, 

our ability to collect amounts due from our clients and others, 

continued availability of funding under our financing agreements, 

general risks associated with doing business outside the U.S., including changes in tax rates, 

our ability to comply with the covenants in our financing or other agreements, 

changes in the frequency or severity of man-made or natural disasters, 

the ability of our third-party service providers, used for certain aspects of our internal business functions, to meet expected service levels, 

our ability to prevent or detect cybersecurity breaches and cyber incidents, 

our ability to achieve targeted integration goals with the consolidation and migration of multiple software platforms, 

proliferation and escalation of international hostilities and geopolitical events, such as the ongoing conflicts in Russia/Ukraine and Israel, 

risks associated with our having a controlling shareholder, and 

impairments of goodwill or our other indefinite-lived intangible assets. 

25 

As a result, undue reliance should not be placed on any forward-looking statements. Actual results and trends in the future may differ materially from those expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made and we undertake no obligation to publicly update any of these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events. 
 The following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ("MD A") should be read in conjunction with (i) our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes thereto for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, and as of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, contained in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, and (ii) our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. As described in Note 1, "Basis of Presentation," the financial results of our operations outside of the U.S., Canada, the Caribbean, and certain subsidiaries in the Philippines are included in our consolidated financial statements on a two-month delayed basis (fiscal year-end of October 31) as permitted by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") in order to provide sufficient time for accumulation of their results. 
 Results of Operations 
 Consolidated revenues before reimbursements decreased 0.7 million, or (0.2) , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 25.8 million, or (2.7) , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared with the same periods of 2023. This decrease was primarily due to decreases in our Platform Solutions operating segment in the 2024 three and nine month periods. Changes in foreign exchange rates decreased our consolidated revenues before reimbursements by 2.2 million, or (0.6) , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 3.2 million, or (0.4) , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared with the prior year periods. To illustrate this impact, segment revenues are presented below, using a constant exchange rate, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024.

Excluding foreign currency impacts, consolidated revenues before reimbursements increased 1.5 million, or 0.4 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024, but decreased 22.6 million, or (2.3) , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared with the same periods of 2023. Revenues from the North America Loss Adjusting segment decreased slightly in the 2024 third quarter and year-to-date periods due to higher weather-related activity in the prior year period. Revenues from the International Operations segment increased in the 2024 third quarter in all geographic regions. Excluding the impacts of foreign currency, revenues from the International Operations segment increased in the 2024 year-to-date period in the U.K., Europe, Asia, and Latin America. Revenues from the Broadspire segment increased for the quarter and year-to-date period due to an increase in Claims and Medical Management revenues. Revenues from the Platform Solutions segment decreased in the third quarter and year-to-date period primarily due to higher weather-related activity in the prior year periods in our Networks and Contractor Connection service lines. 
 26 

Overall, there was a decrease in cases received of (14.5) for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and a decrease of (10.2) for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Within our North America Loss Adjusting segment, the reduction in cases received for the 2024 third quarter and year-to-date period was primarily due to the loss of a customer in the Contractor Connection service line in Canada. Cases within our International Operations segment declined for the third quarter, primarily due to decreases in the U.K. and Latin America, due to decreases in high-frequency, low-severity cases, partially offset by increases in Europe, Australia, and Asia. For the year to date period, cases increased within the International Operations segment, due primarily to increases in Latin America related to high-frequency, low-severity cases, and Australia, which had an increase in weather-related cases compared to the prior year. There was a decline in cases within our Broadspire segment for the third quarter and year-to-date period related to the non-recurrence of takeover claims for disability clients within Claims Management. The decrease in Broadspire claims was partially offset by an increase in Medical Management referrals for the third quarter and year-to-date period. Within our Platform Solutions segment, there was a decrease in each period presented related to the Networks and the Contractor Connection service lines.

Costs of services provided, before reimbursements, increased 6.0 million, or 2.6 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the 2023 period. The increase was primarily due to an increase in compensation expense and other costs in the all segments other than Platform Solutions, which had decreases in compensation expense and other costs due to lower revenues. Costs of services decreased 18.5 million, or (2.7) for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared with the 2023 periods. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in compensation expense and other costs in the Platform Solutions segment resulting from the lower revenues, partially offset by increases in compensation expense and other costs in our three other operating segments. 
 Selling, general, and administrative ("SG A") expenses decreased (2.9) million, or (3.9) , in the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared with the 2023 period. The decrease was primarily due to a benefit from contingent earnout adjustments made in the 2024 third quarter. SG A expenses increased 9.5 million, or 4.5 , in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared with the 2023 period, primarily due to professional fees, IT costs, bad debt expense, and compensation expense, including taxes and benefits, partially offset by the benefit from contingent earnout adjustments. 
 27 

Operating Earnings of our Operating Segments 
 We believe that a discussion and analysis of the segment operating earnings of our operating segments is helpful in understanding the results of our operations. Operating earnings is our segment measure of profitability presented in conformity with the Financial Accounting Standards Board's ("FASB") Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") Topic 280 "Segment Reporting." Operating earnings is the primary financial performance measure used by our senior management and CODM to evaluate the financial performance of our operating segments and make resource allocation and certain compensation decisions. 
 We believe operating earnings is a measure that is useful for others to evaluate segment operating performance using the same criteria used by our senior management and CODM. Segment operating earnings represents segment earnings, including the direct and indirect costs of certain administrative functions required to operate our business, but excludes unallocated corporate and shared costs and credits, net corporate interest expense, stock option expense, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, contingent earnout adjustments, non-service pension costs, income taxes, and net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests. 
 Administrative functions such as finance, human resources, information technology, quality and compliance, exist both in a centralized shared-service arrangement and within certain operations. Each of these functions is managed by centralized management and the costs of those services is allocated to the segments as indirect costs based on usage. 
 Gross profit is defined as segment revenues, less segment direct costs, which exclude centralized indirect administrative support costs allocated to the business. 
 Income taxes, net corporate interest expense, stock option expense, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, contingent earnout adjustments, and non-service pension costs are recurring components of our net income, but they are not considered part of our segment operating earnings because they are managed on a corporate-wide basis. Income taxes are calculated for the Company on a consolidated basis based on statutory rates in effect in the various jurisdictions in which we provide services, and vary significantly by jurisdiction. Net corporate interest expense results from capital structure decisions made by senior management and the Board of Directors, affecting the Company as a whole. Stock option expense represents the non-cash costs generally related to stock options and employee stock purchase plan expenses which are not allocated to our operating segments. Contingent earnout adjustments represent fair value adjustments of earnout liabilities arising from recent acquisitions. Amortization expense is a non-cash expense for finite-lived acquisition-related and trade name intangible assets acquired in business combinations. Non-service pension costs represent the U.S. and U.K. non-service defined benefit pension costs, which are non-operating in nature as the U.S. plan is frozen and the U.K. plans are closed to new participants. The service cost component of the U.K. plans remains in compensation expense. The exclusion of this measurement is intended to exclude market volatility related to an expense that is non-operating in nature and not related to business performance. None of these costs relate directly to the performance of our services or operating activities and, therefore, are excluded from segment operating earnings in order to better assess the results of each segment's operating activities on a consistent basis. 
 Unallocated corporate and shared costs and credits include expenses and credits related to our chief executive officer and Board of Directors, certain provisions for bad debt allowances or subsequent recoveries such as those related to bankrupt clients, certain unallocated professional fees, and certain self-insurance costs and recoveries that are not allocated to our individual operating segments. 
 Additional discussion and analysis of our income taxes, net corporate interest expense, stock option expense, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, contingent earnout adjustments, non-service pension costs, and unallocated corporate and shared costs, net follows the discussion and analysis of the results of operations of our four operating segments. 
 Segment Revenues 
 In the normal course of business, our operating segments incur certain out-of-pocket expenses that are thereafter reimbursed by our clients. Under GAAP, these out-of-pocket expenses and associated reimbursements are reported on a gross basis when reporting revenues and expenses, respectively, in our unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. In the discussion and analysis of results of operations which follows, we do not include a gross up of expenses and revenues for these pass-through reimbursed expenses. The amounts of reimbursed expenses and related revenues offset each other in our results of operations with no impact to our net income or operating earnings. A reconciliation of revenues before reimbursements to total revenues determined in accordance with GAAP is presented on the face of the accompanying unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
 Our segment results are impacted by changes in foreign exchange rates. We believe that a non-GAAP discussion and analysis of segment revenues before reimbursements by major region, based on actual exchange rates and using a constant exchange rate, is helpful in understanding the results of our segment operations. 
 Segment Expenses 
 Our discussion and analysis of segment operating expenses is comprised of two components: "Direct Compensation, Fringe Benefits Non-Employee Labor" and "Expenses Other Than Direct Compensation, Fringe Benefits Non-Employee Labor." 
 28 

"Direct Compensation, Fringe Benefits Non-Employee Labor" includes direct compensation, payroll taxes, and benefits provided to the employees of each segment, as well as payments to outsourced service providers that augment our staff in each segment. As a service company, these costs represent our most significant and variable operating expenses. 
 Costs of administrative functions, including direct compensation, payroll taxes, and benefits, are managed centrally and considered indirect costs. The allocated indirect costs of our shared-services infrastructure are allocated to each segment based on usage and reflected within "Expenses Other Than Direct Compensation, Fringe Benefits Non-Employee Labor" of each segment. 
 In addition to allocated corporate and shared costs, "Expenses Other Than Direct Compensation, Fringe Benefits Non-Employee Labor" includes travel and entertainment, office rent and occupancy costs, automobile expenses, office operating expenses, data processing costs, cost of risk, professional fees, and amortization and depreciation expense other than amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets. 
 In addition, we believe that a non-GAAP discussion and analysis of segment gross profit is helpful in understanding the results of our segment operations, excluding indirect centralized administrative support costs. Our discussion and analysis of segment gross profit includes the revenues and direct expenses of each segment. 
 Unless noted in the following discussion and analysis, revenue amounts exclude reimbursements for out-of-pocket expenses and expense amounts exclude reimbursed out-of-pocket expenses. 
 Segment Performance Indicators 
 We typically earn our revenues on an individual fee-per-claim basis for claims management services we provide to carriers, brokers and corporates. Accordingly, the volume of claim referrals to us is a key driver of our revenues. We believe that a discussion and analysis of the segment unit volumes, as measured by cases received, is helpful in understanding the results of our operations.

NORTH AMERICA LOSS ADJUSTING SEGMENT 
 Operating earnings in our North America Loss Adjusting segment totaled 5.4 million, or 6.9 of revenues before reimbursements, for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared with 2023 operating earnings of 10.5 million, or 13.1 of revenues before reimbursements. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our North American Loss Adjusting segment reported operating earnings of 14.8 million, or 6.4 of revenues before reimbursements, compared with 2023 operating earnings of 22.4 million, or 9.6 of revenues before reimbursements. The decrease in operating earnings in the 2024 third quarter was due to a decrease in revenues in U.S. Field Operations due to benign weather in the current year, increases in expenses within Global Technical Services related to investments to support growth, and a decrease in higher margin claims in Canada. The decrease in year-to-date operating earnings was due to the decrease in revenues in Canada and U.S. Field Operations and reduced staff utilization related to the higher weather-related activity in the prior year period. 
 Excluding centralized indirect support costs, gross profit decreased from 19.7 million, or 24.7 of revenues before reimbursements in 2023, to 14.8 million, or 18.6 of revenues before reimbursements, in the three months ended September 30, 2024, due to a decrease in revenues in U.S. Field Operations, increases in expenses within Global Technical Services, and a decrease in revenues in Canada. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, gross profit decreased from 50.4 million or 21.6 of revenues before reimbursements in 2023 to 43.8 million, or 18.8 of revenues before reimbursements, due to a decrease in revenues in U.S. Field Operations, increases in expenses within Global Technical Services, and a decrease in revenues in Canada, as compared to the prior year.

Revenues before reimbursements from our North America Loss Adjusting segment totaled 79.3 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared with 80.0 million in the 2023 period. This slight decrease was due to a decrease in Canada and U.S. Field Operations, primarily driven by higher weather-related activity in the prior year period, partially offset by an increase in U.S. Global Technical Services revenues due to increased business from new and existing clients. The change in exchange rates decreased our North America Loss Adjusting segment revenues by approximately (0.5) , or (0.4) million, for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared with the 2023 period. Absent foreign exchange rate fluctuations, North America Loss Adjusting segment revenues would have been 79.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024. There was a decrease in segment unit volume, measured principally by cases received, of (16.2) for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared with the 2023 period. This includes a decrease in high-frequency, low-severity cases received in Contractor Connection in Canada of 10,700 or 13.6 . Changes in product mix and in the rates charged for those services accounted for a 2.3 revenue increase for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared with the same period in 2023, due to increases in pricing and average fee per case. 
 Revenues before reimbursements from our North America Loss Adjusting segment totaled 232.7 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared with 233.9 million in the 2023 period. This slight decrease was due to a decrease in Canada and U.S. Field Operations, primarily driven by higher weather-related activity in the prior year period, partially offset by an increase in U.S. Global Technical Services revenues due to increased business from new and existing clients. The change in exchange rates decreased our North America Loss Adjusting segment revenues by approximately (0.3) , or (0.8) million, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared with the 2023 period. Absent foreign exchange rate fluctuations, North America Loss Adjusting segment revenues would have been 233.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. There was a decrease in segment unit volume, measured principally by cases received, of (16.9) for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared with the 2023 period. This includes a decrease in high-frequency, low-severity cases received in Contractor Connection in Canada of 34,500 or 15.3 . Changes in product mix and in the rates charged for those services accounted for a 1.4 revenue increase for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared with the same period in 2023, due to increases in pricing and average fee per case.

 Reimbursements for out-of-pocket expenses incurred in our North America Loss Adjusting segment, which are included in total Company revenues, were 2.2 million and 2.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Reimbursements were 6.5 million and 7.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. These decreases were due to the decrease in claims in the U.S. and a decrease in revenues and claims received in Canada.

Overall, there was a decrease in cases of (16.2) in the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023. The decrease in U.S. case volumes in the 2024 third quarter was due to higher weather-related activity in the prior year period partially offset by an increase in Global Technical Services. There was a decrease in cases in Canada in the 2024 third quarter primarily due to 10,700 less high-frequency, low-severity Contractor Connection cases related to the loss of a customer, as compared with the 2023 period. 
 There was a decrease in cases of (16.9) in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023. The decrease in U.S. case volumes in the 2024 year-to-date period was due to higher weather-related activity in the prior year period partially offset by an increase in Global Technical Services. There was a decrease in cases in Canada in the 2024 year-to-date period primarily due to 34,500 less high-frequency, low-severity Contractor Connection cases related to the loss of a customer, as compared with the 2023 period. 
 Direct Compensation, Fringe Benefits Non-Employee Labor 
 The most significant expense in our North America Loss Adjusting segment is the compensation of employees, including related payroll taxes and fringe benefits, and the payments to outsourced service providers that augment the functions performed by our employees. As a percentage of revenues before reimbursements, these expenses were 71.9 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared with 67.1 for the 2023 period. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, these expenses were 71.9 compared with 69.4 for the 2023 period. The total dollar amount of these expenses increased to 57.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 53.6 million for the comparable 2023 period, and were 167.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increasing from 162.4 million in 2023. The third quarter and year-to-date increases were due to increases in expert adjusting staff in U.S. Global Technical Services, partially offset by decreases in employees in U.S. Field Operations and Canada. The increase in the percentage of revenues before reimbursements is due to lower staff utilization in U.S. Field Operations, Global Technical Services and Canada, compared to the 2023 periods. There was an average of 2,003 full-time equivalent employees in this segment in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared with an average of 2,058 in the 2023 period. 
 Expenses Other than Reimbursements, Direct Compensation, Fringe Benefits Non-Employee Labor 
 North America Loss Adjusting expenses other than reimbursements, direct compensation, fringe benefits, and non-employee labor were 16.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared with 15.9 million for the 2023 period. As a percentage of revenues before reimbursements, these expenses were 21.2 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared with 19.9 for the 2023 period. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, these expenses were 50.7 million, compared with 49.1 million for the 2023 period. As a percentage of revenues before reimbursements, these expenses were 21.8 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared with 21.0 for the 2023 period. The increase in the 2024 third quarter expenses and percentage of revenues before reimbursements was due to an increase in allowance for estimated credit losses and higher self-insurance costs as compared to the 2023 period. The increase in the 2024 year-to-date amounts and percentage of revenues before reimbursements was due to higher technology investments, auto expenses, and self-insurance costs, partially offset by improvements in the allowance for estimated credit losses as compared to the 2023 period.

 Operating earnings in our International Operations segment were 5.1 million, or 4.9 of revenues before reimbursements, for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared with 2.2 million, or 2.2 of revenues before reimbursements, in the 2023 period. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our International Operations segment reported operating earnings of 12.5 million, or 4.1 of revenues before reimbursements, compared with operating earnings in 2023 of 9.0 million, or 3.1 of revenues before reimbursements. The increase in operating earnings in the 2024 periods was primarily due to revenue increases in the U.K. and Europe. 
 Excluding centralized indirect support costs, gross profit increased from 14.5 million, or 14.8 of revenues before reimbursements in 2023, to 18.5 million, or 17.5 of revenues before reimbursements, in the three months ended September 30, 2024. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, gross profit increased from 47.2 million, or 16.6 of revenues before reimbursements in 2023, to 53.7 million, or 17.5 of revenues before reimbursements. The increase in gross profit in the 2024 periods was driven by the increase in revenues.

Revenues before reimbursements from our International Operations segment totaled 105.7 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared with 98.1 million in the 2023 period. This increase was due to an increase in all geographic regions. The change in exchange rates decreased our International Operations segment revenues by approximately (1.9) , or 1.8 million, for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared with the 2023 period. Absent foreign exchange rate fluctuations, International Operations segment revenues would have been 107.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024. There was a decrease in segment unit volume, measured principally by cases received, of (6.8) for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared with the 2023 period. There was a decrease in high-frequency, low-severity cases of 10,100, or (8.3) , primarily in the U.K. There was also an increase in higher-value third-party administration claims in the U.K, which led to a 3.9 increase in revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared with the 2023 period. Changes in product mix and in the rates charged for those services accounted for a 4.3 revenue increase for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared with the same period in 2023. 
 Revenues before reimbursements from our International Operations segment totaled 306.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared with 285.2 million in the 2023 period. This increase was primarily due to increases in the U.K, Europe, and Latin America. The change in exchange rates decreased our International Operations segment revenues by approximately (0.9) , or 2.4 million, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared with 2023. Absent foreign exchange rate fluctuations, International Operations segment revenues would have been 308.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. There was an increase in segment unit volume, measured principally by cases received, of 2.2 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared with the 2023 period. There was a net decrease in high-frequency, low-severity cases of 6,600 or (1.8 ), driven primarily by fewer high-frequency, low-severity cases in the U.K., partially offset by an increase in high-frequency, low-severity cases in Brazil. There was also an increase in higher-value third-party administration claims in the U.K, which led to a 2.1 increase in revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared with the 2023 period. Changes in product mix and in the rates charged for those services accounted for a 2.1 revenue increase for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared with the same period in 2023. 
 35 

Based on constant foreign exchange rates, the increase in revenues in the U.K. for the 2024 third quarter and year-to-date period was due to an increase in property and third party administration revenues driven by higher value claims. There was an increase in revenues in Europe in the 2024 periods, compared with 2023, due to increases in Netherlands, Norway, the Middle East, and Germany. There was an increase in Australia in the 2024 third quarter, compared with 2023, due to an increase in Contractor Connection claims, while the year-to-date period had a decrease due to a large flooding event in 2022 that continued to provide revenues into 2023. There was an increase in revenues in Asia in the 2024 third quarter, compared with 2023, due to increases in Taiwan, and Hong Kong, while the year-to-date period experienced a decrease from the 2023 period due to decreased large loss claims in Thailand and higher weather-related activity in the prior year period in the Philippines. The increase in revenues in Latin America in the 2024 periods was primarily driven by increased volumes across third-party administration and loss adjusting in Brazil.

Direct Compensation, Fringe Benefits Non-Employee Labor 
 The most significant expense in our International Operations segment is the compensation of employees, including related payroll taxes and fringe benefits, and the payments to outsourced service providers that augment the functions performed by our employees. As a percentage of revenues before reimbursements, these expenses were 65.6 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared with 67.7 for the 2023 period. The total dollar amount of these expenses was 69.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 66.4 million for the 2023 period. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, these expenses were 65.5 , compared with 66.7 in 2023, and were 200.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 190.2 million in 2023. The increase was due to increases in compensation expense, related to the increase in revenues, including incentive compensation. The decrease in the percentage of revenues before reimbursements is due to higher revenues in the 2024 periods and improved staff utilization. There was an average of 3,638 full-time equivalent employees in this segment in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared with an average of 3,660 in the comparable 2023 period. 
 Expenses Other than Reimbursements, Direct Compensation, Fringe Benefits Non-Employee Labor 
 International Operations expenses other than reimbursements, direct compensation, fringe benefits, and non-employee labor were 31.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared with 29.4 million for the 2023 period. As a percentage of revenues before reimbursements, these expenses were 29.5 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared with 30.0 for the 2023 period. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, these expenses were 93.2 million, compared with 86.1 million for the 2023 period. As a percentage of revenues before reimbursements, these expenses were 30.4 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared with 30.2 for the 2023 period. The increase in the expense for the 2024 third quarter was due to an increase in revenues, while the percentage of revenues before reimbursements decreased due to improved operating leverage. The increase in the year-to-date expense and percent of revenues before reimbursements was due to increased IT application costs and increased self-insurance costs. 
 BROADSPIRE SEGMENT 
 Our Broadspire segment reported operating earnings of 14.4 million, or 14.5 of revenues before reimbursements, for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared with 13.5 million, or 14.7 of revenues before reimbursements, for the third quarter of 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our Broadspire segment reported operating earnings of 42.3 million, or 14.6 of revenues before reimbursements, compared with 2023 operating earnings of 29.6 million, or 11.2 of revenues before reimbursements. The increase in the 2024 third quarter and year-to-date periods was due to an increase in revenues resulting from new client programs, increased medical management usage, and pricing improvements. 
 Excluding centralized indirect support costs, third quarter gross profit increased from 25.5 million, or 27.6 of revenues before reimbursements, in 2023 to 25.6 million, or 25.9 of revenues before reimbursements in 2024. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, gross profit increased from 64.5 million, or 24.5 of revenues before reimbursements in 2023, to 76.2 million, or 26.3 of revenues before reimbursements. This increase was due to the increased revenues and improved staff utilization.

Revenues before reimbursements from our Broadspire segment totaled 99.0 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared with 92.2 million in the 2023 period. This increase was primarily due to an increase in new client growth across both service lines. There was a decrease in segment unit volume, measured principally by cases received, of (1.7) for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared with the same period of 2023. This was primarily due to takeover claims for a disability client in the prior year third quarter, which resulted in 7,000 claims, or 4.9 , with minimal revenues which did not recur in 2024. Revenues were positively impacted by 0.7 million increase in revenues within our Claims Management service line related to income earned which offsets the costs of managing the funds maintained to administer claims for our customers, for which no cases are received, or 0.7 of the increase in revenues. There was also a 2.1 million increase in revenues within our Medical Management service line for which no cases are received, or 2.3 of the increase in revenues. Changes in product mix and in the rates charged for those services accounted for a 1.2 revenue increase for the 2024 third quarter compared with the 2023 period. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, revenues before reimbursements from our Broadspire segment totaled 290.4 million compared with 263.5 million in the 2023 period. This increase was primarily due to an increase in new client growth across both service lines. There was a slight decrease in segment unit volume, measured principally by cases received, of (0.1) for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared with the same period of 2023. There was a decrease in claims related to the prior year takeover claims for disability clients in the prior year second and third quarters, which resulted in 24,700 claims, or 6.0 , with minimal revenues which did not recur in 2024. Revenues were positively impacted by 3.0 million increase in revenues within our Claims Management service line related to income earned which offsets the costs of managing the funds maintained to administer claims for our customers, for which no cases are received, or 1.1 of the increase in revenues. There was also a 7.4 million increase in revenues within our Medical Management service line for which no cases are received, or 2.8 of the increase in revenues. Changes in product mix and in the rates charged for those services accounted for a 0.4 revenue increase for the 2024 nine-month period compared with the 2023 period.

Overall case volumes decreased (1.7) for the three months ended September 30, 2024 due primarily to the non-recurrence of 7,000 takeover claims for a disability client within Claims Management. This was offset by an increase in Medical Management referrals. Case volumes were (0.1) lower for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 due to the non-recurrence of 24,700 takeover claims for disability clients within Claims Management, substantially offset by an increase of Medical Management referrals. 
 Direct Compensation, Fringe Benefits Non-Employee Labor 
 The most significant expense in our Broadspire segment is the compensation of employees, including related payroll taxes and fringe benefits, and the payments to outsourced service providers that augment the functions performed by our employees. These expenses totaled 59.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 54.3 million for the 2023 period. As a percent of the related revenues before reimbursements, these expenses increased from 58.9 in the 2023 third quarter to 60.3 in 2024 third quarter. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, these expenses totaled 175.1 million, compared to 161.5 million in 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, these expenses, as a percent of the related revenues before reimbursements, decreased from 61.3 in 2023 to 60.3 in 2024. The increase in cost in the third quarter and year-to-date period was primarily due to increased employees, average wages, and incentive compensation, related to the increase in revenues. Improved efficiency with higher revenues combined for lower percentages of revenues before reimbursements for the nine-month period, while the three months ended September 30, 2024 had a higher percentage of revenues before reimbursements due to increased employees and lower revenue growth compared to the year-to-date period. Average full-time equivalent employees in this segment totaled 2,691 in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared with 2,601 in the 2023 period. 
 Expenses Other than Reimbursements, Direct Compensation, Fringe Benefits Non-Employee Labor 
 Broadspire segment expenses other than reimbursements, direct compensation, fringe benefits, and non-employee labor as a percent of revenues before reimbursements were 25.2 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared with 26.4 in the 2023 period. The amount of these expenses increased from 24.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 24.9 million in 2024 related to higher professional fees and self-insurance costs, partially offset by lower amortization and indirect support costs. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 these expenses were 73.0 million, compared with 72.5 million for the 2023 period. As a percentage of revenues before reimbursements, these expenses were 25.1 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared with 27.5 for the 2023 period. The decrease in the expense as a percent of revenues before reimbursements was due to the increased revenues and operating efficiencies. 
 PLATFORM SOLUTIONS SEGMENT 
 Our Platform Solutions segment reported operating earnings of 3.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared with operating earnings of 8.5 million in the 2023 period. The segment operating margin decreased from 14.2 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, to 8.5 in the comparable 2024 period. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our Platform Solutions segment reported operating earnings of 6.4 million, or 5.5 of revenues before reimbursements, compared with 2023 operating earnings of 26.6 million, or 14.1 of revenues before reimbursements. The decrease was primarily due to a reduction in revenues in our Networks service line due to higher weather-related activity in the prior year period resulting in decreased need for staff augmentation services in the 2024 periods and lower Contractor Connection revenues. 
 39 

Excluding indirect support costs, gross profit in the second quarter decreased from 14.1 million, or 23.5 of revenues before reimbursements in 2023, to 9.8 million, or 21.5 of revenues before reimbursements, in 2024. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, gross profit decreased from 43.5 million, or 23.1 of revenues before reimbursements in 2023, to 24.3 million, or 20.9 of revenues before reimbursements, in 2024. This decrease was primarily due to a reduction in revenues in our Networks service line due to higher weather-related activity in the prior year periods resulting in decreased need for staff augmentation services by our clients in the 2024 periods and lower Contractor Connection revenues. 
 Operating results for our Platform Solutions segment, including gross profit, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were as follows:

Revenues before reimbursements from our Platform Solutions segment totaled 45.3 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared with 59.8 million in the 2023 period. This decrease was primarily due to a reduction in our Networks service line where we provide staff augmentation for our clients, along with a decrease in our Contractor Connection service line due to higher weather-related activity in the prior year period, partially offset by an increase in our Subrogation service line. There was a decrease in segment unit volume, measured principally by cases received, of (33.8) , for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared with the 2023 period. There was a reduction in low value inspection services cases within our Networks service line of 4,500 cases, or 3.3 in the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 2023. There was a change in revenues from staff argumentation average rates in our Networks service line which increased revenues 4.0 in the 2024 third quarter. Changes in product mix and in the rates charged for those services accounted for a 2.2 revenue increase for the 2024 three-month period compared with 2023, due to increases in average case values. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, revenues before reimbursements from our Platform Solutions segment totaled 116.0 million, compared with 188.3 million in the 2023 period. This decrease was primarily due to a reduction in our Networks service line where we provide staff augmentation for our clients, along with a decrease in our Contractor Connection service line due to higher weather-related activity in the prior year period, offset partially by an increase in our Subrogation service line. There was a decrease in segment unit volume, measured principally by cases received, of (30.8) , compared with the 2023 period. There was a reduction in low value inspection services cases within our Networks service line of 24,300 cases, or 6.9 in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 2023. There was a change in revenues from staff argumentation average rates in our Networks service line which resulted in decreased revenues of (13.6) in the 2024 nine-month period. Changes in product mix and in the rates charged for those services accounted for a (0.9) revenue decrease for the 2024 nine-month period compared with 2023, due to decreases in average case values.

Overall case volumes were (33.8) lower in the three months ended September 30, 2024 and (30.8) lower in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared with the 2023 periods, due to decreases in Contractor Connection and Networks driven by higher weather-related activity in the prior year periods. There was a reduction in low value inspection services cases within our Networks service line of 4,500 and 24,300 cases in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to the 2023 periods. The decrease in cases in our Networks and Contractor Connection service lines in the 2024 periods is due to higher weather-related activity in the prior year periods. The decrease in cases in our Subrogation service line in the three months ended September 30, 2024 was due to a special project in the 2023 period that ended in 2023. The increase in cases in Subrogation for the year-to-date period is due to an increase from higher volume customers.

Direct Compensation, Fringe Benefits Non-Employee Labor 
 Platform Solutions direct compensation, fringe benefits, and non-employee labor expenses as a percent of revenues before reimbursements were 64.0 in the 2024 third quarter compared with 66.2 in the 2023 quarter. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, these expenses were 61.5 compared with 66.0 in 2023. The dollar amount of these expenses was 29.0 million for the 2024 second quarter and 39.6 million in the 2023 quarter, and were 71.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 124.2 million in 2023. The decrease in costs in the third quarter and year-to-date periods was due to the reduction in revenues. There was an average of 980 full-time equivalent employees in the Platform Solutions segment in the 2024 year-to-date period, compared with an average of 1,417 for the 2023 period. 
 Expenses Other than Reimbursements, Direct Compensation, Fringe Benefits Non-Employee Labor 
 Expenses other than reimbursements, direct compensation, fringe benefits, and non-employee labor were 27.6 of Platform Solutions revenues before reimbursements for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared with 19.5 for the period in 2023. The dollar amount of these expenses was 12.5 million for the 2024 third quarter and 11.7 million in the 2023 quarter. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, these expenses were 38.3 million, compared with 37.5 million for the 2023 period. As a percentage of revenues before reimbursements, these expenses were 33.0 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared with 19.9 for the 2023 period. The increase as a percent of revenues before reimbursements for the third quarter and year-to-date periods is due to the lower revenues in the 2024 periods. 
 
 EXPENSES AND CREDITS EXCLUDED FROM SEGMENT OPERATING EARNINGS 
 Income Taxes 
 Our consolidated effective income tax rate may change periodically due to changes in enacted tax rates, fluctuations in the mix of income earned from our various domestic and international operations which are subject to income taxes at different rates, our ability to utilize net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards, amounts related to uncertain income tax positions, and goodwill impairments. We estimate that our effective income tax rate for 2024 will be approximately 33 to 35 after considering known discrete items as of September 30, 2024. 
 The provision for income taxes on consolidated income before income tax totaled 5.3 million and 6.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The overall effective tax rate increased to 36.2 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared with 35.8 for the 2023 period primarily due to one-time discrete tax items in the prior year period. 
 The provision for income taxes on consolidated income before income tax totaled 10.9 million and 17.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The overall effective tax rate decreased to 34.5 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared with 35.6 for the 2023 period primarily due to one-time discrete tax items in the prior year period. 
 Net Corporate Interest Expense 
 Net corporate interest expense consists of interest expense that we incur on our short- and long-term borrowings, partially offset by any interest income we earn on available cash balances and short-term investments. These amounts vary based on interest rates, borrowings outstanding and the amounts of invested cash. Corporate interest expense totaled 5.5 million and 5.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Interest income was 0.8 million and 0.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Corporate interest expense totaled 15.1 million and 14.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Interest income was 2.5 million and 1.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 Stock Option Expense 
 Stock option expense, a component of stock-based compensation, is comprised of non-cash expenses related to stock options granted under our various stock option and employee stock purchase plans. Stock option expense is not allocated to our operating segments. Stock option expense totaled 0.2 million and 0.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Stock option expense totaled 0.5 million and 0.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 Amortization of Acquisition-Related Intangible Assets 
 Amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets represents the non-cash amortization expense for finite-lived customer-relationship and trade name intangible assets. Amortization expense associated with these intangible assets totaled 1.9 million and 2.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Amortization expense associated with these intangible assets totaled 5.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 5.9 million for the 2023 period. This amortization expense is included in "Selling, general, and administrative expenses" in our unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
 42 

Unallocated Corporate and Shared Costs, Net 
 Certain unallocated corporate and shared costs are excluded from the determination of segment operating earnings. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, unallocated corporate and shared costs and credits represented expenses for our chief executive officer and our Board of Directors, certain adjustments to our self-insured liabilities, certain unallocated legal costs and professional fees, and certain adjustments and recoveries to our allowances for estimated credit losses. 
 Unallocated corporate and shared costs were 7.0 million and 4.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase in the 2024 third quarter was primarily due to an increase in self-insurance expense, professional fees, and reserves on assets. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, unallocated corporate and shared costs were 20.1 million and 10.0 million, respectively. The increase in the year-to-date period was primarily due to increases in self-insurance expense, professional fees, and other reserves. 
 Contingent Earnout Adjustments 
 Contingent earnout (benefit) expense represents the fair value adjustment of earnout liabilities arising from recent acquisitions. This resulted in benefits of (2.1) million and (1.5) million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to expenses of 2.1 million and 3.1 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The fair value adjustment is based on changes to projections of acquired entities over the respective earnout periods, which span multiple years. 
 Non-Service Pension Costs 
 Non-service pension costs totaled 2.4 million and 7.3 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to 2.2 million and 6.4 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. Non-service pension costs represents the U.S. and U.K. non-service defined benefit pension costs, which are non-operating in nature as the U.S. plan is frozen and the U.K. plans are closed to new participants. The service cost component of the U.K. plans remains in compensation expense. 
 
 LIQUIDITY, CAPITAL RESOURCES, AND FINANCIAL CONDITION 
 At September 30, 2024, our working capital balance (current assets less current liabilities) was approximately 79.0 million, an increase of 8.9 million from the working capital balance at December 31, 2023. Our cash and cash equivalents were 52.3 million at September 30, 2024, compared with 58.4 million at December 31, 2023. 
 Cash and cash equivalents as of September 30, 2024 consisted of 26.0 million held in the U.S. and 26.3 million held in our foreign subsidiaries. The Company generally does not provide for additional U.S. and foreign income taxes on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries because they are considered to be indefinitely reinvested. The Company maintained its permanent reinvestment assertion on a portion of prior year undistributed earnings for certain foreign operations and accrued deferred taxes attributable to these earnings. The majority of the remaining historical earnings and future foreign earnings are expected to remain permanently reinvested and will be used to provide working capital for these operations, fund defined benefit pension plan obligations, repay non-U.S. debt, fund capital improvements, and fund future acquisitions. 
 However, if at a future date or time funds that remain permanently reinvested are necessary for our operations in the U.S. or we otherwise believe it is in our best interests to repatriate all or a portion of such funds, we may be required to accrue and pay taxes to repatriate these funds. No assurances can be provided as to the amount or timing thereof, the tax consequences related thereto, or the ultimate impact any such action may have on our results of operations or financial condition. 
 Cash Provided by Operating Activities 
 Cash provided by operating activities was 11.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared with 68.1 million provided from operating activities in the 2023 period. The decrease in cash provided was primarily driven by lower earnings, net change in incentive compensation, net change in unbilled receivables, and other working capital items as compared to prior year. 
 Cash Used in Investing Activities 
 Cash used in investing activities was 29.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared with 27.7 million used in the first nine months of 2023. The increase in cash used in 2024 was due to increases in capital expenditures in 2024 compared to 2023. 
 43 

Cash Provided by (Used in) Financing Activities 
 Cash provided by financing activities was 13.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared with 38.1 million used in the 2023 period. During the first nine months of 2024, there was an increase of 29.0 million in net borrowing from our revolving credit facility, compared with a net increase during the 2023 period of 22.8 million. The increase in borrowing in the 2024 period was primarily related to lower cash flows from operations. Share repurchases totaled 3.6 million in the 2024 period, compared with 0.6 million in the 2023 period. We paid 10.3 million in dividends in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared with 9.3 million in the 2023 period. 
 Other Matters Concerning Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 As a component of our Credit Facility with Bank of America (the "Credit Facility"), we maintain a letter of credit facility to satisfy certain contractual obligations. Including 8.9 million of undrawn letters of credit issued under the letter of credit facility, the available balance under our credit facility totaled 207.3 million at September 30, 2024. Our short-term debt obligations typically peak during the first half of each year due to the annual payment of incentive compensation, contributions to retirement plans, working capital fluctuations, and certain other recurring payments, and generally decline during the balance of the year. The balance of short-term borrowings represents amounts under our credit facility that we expect, but are not required, to repay in the next twelve months. Long- and short-term borrowings outstanding, including current installments and finance leases, totaled 238.4 million as of September 30, 2024 compared with 209.1 million at December 31, 2023. 
 Our liquidity is defined as cash on hand and borrowing capacity under our Credit Facility based on our trailing twelve month EBITDA, as defined in our Credit Facility. At September 30, 2024, we had 52.3 million of cash on hand and, based on trailing twelve month EBITDA and the Credit Facility limit, additional borrowing capacity of 183.8 million, resulting in total liquidity of 236.1 million at September 30, 2024. 
 Additionally, the Company expects to make payments totaling 1.3 million in the next twelve months for contingent earnouts related to previous business acquisitions. 
 Defined Benefit Pension Funding and Cost 
 We sponsor a qualified defined benefit pension plan in the U.S. (the "U.S. Qualified Plan"), three defined benefit pension plans in the U.K., and defined benefit pension plans in the Netherlands, Norway, Germany, and the Philippines. Effective December 31, 2002, we froze our U.S. Qualified Plan. Our frozen U.S. Qualified Plan and U.K. plans were underfunded by 22.3 million and overfunded by 10.9 million, respectively, at December 31, 2023, based on accumulated benefit obligations of 285.3 million and 145.3 million for the U.S. Qualified Plan and the U.K. plans, respectively. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 we made no contributions to our U.S. defined benefit pension plan and 1.9 million to our U.K defined benefit pension plans, compared with no contributions to the U.S. plan and 1.8 million to the U.K. plans for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. We do not expect to make any additional discretionary contributions to our U.S. defined benefit pension plan during the remainder of 2024. Anticipated funding for the other international plans is not significant. 
 Dividend Payments 
 Our Board of Directors makes dividend decisions from time to time based in part on an assessment of current and projected earnings and cash flows. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we paid 10.3 million in dividends. Our ability to pay future dividends could be impacted by many factors including the funding requirements of our defined benefit pension plans, repayments of outstanding borrowings, levels of cash expected to be generated by our operating activities, and covenants and other restrictions contained in any credit facilities or other financing agreements. 
 Financial Condition 
 Other significant changes on our unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as of September 30, 2024, compared with our unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2023 were as follows: 
 Accrued taxes decreased by 5.5 million excluding foreign currency exchange impacts. This decrease was primarily due to the timing of tax payments. 

Unbilled revenues increased 17.3 million excluding foreign exchange impacts. The increase is primarily attributable to Global Technical Services in the North America Loss Adjusting Segment and Europe, the U.K., and Australia in the International Operations segment. 

Accounts payable and accrued liabilities decreased 17.1 million excluding foreign currency exchange impacts. The decrease is primarily due to payments for employee incentive compensation earned in 2023 and timing of accrued payroll. 

At September 30, 2024, we were not a party to any off-balance sheet arrangements which we believe could materially impact our operations, financial condition, or cash flows. 
 44 

As disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, we have certain material obligations under operating lease agreements to which we are a party. The Company records operating lease-related assets and liabilities on our unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
 We also maintain funds in various trust accounts to administer claims for certain clients. These funds are not available for our general operating activities and, as such, have not been recorded in the accompanying unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. We have concluded that we do not have a material off-balance sheet risk related to these funds. 
 APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES 
 There have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates from those disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 New Accounting Standards Adopted 
 No new accounting standard were adopted during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Pending Adoption of New Accounting Standards 
 Additional information related to the pending adoption of new accounting standards is provided in Note 2 to the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitati ve Disclosures About Market Risk 
 For a discussion of quantitative and qualitative disclosures about the Company's market risk, see Item 7A, "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk," of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Our exposures to market risk have not changed materially since December 31, 2023. 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 The Registrant maintains a set of disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act"), designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Registrant in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized or reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and regulations. 
 Management necessarily applies its judgment in assessing the costs and benefits of such controls and procedures, which, by their nature, can provide only reasonable assurance regarding management's control objectives. The Company's management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that its disclosure controls and procedures can prevent all possible errors or fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. Judgments in decision-making can be faulty and breakdowns can occur because of simple errors or mistakes. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of one or more persons. The design of any system of controls is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and while the Company's disclosure controls and procedures are designed to be effective under circumstances where they should reasonably be expected to operate effectively, there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Because of the inherent limitations in any control system, misstatements due to possible errors or fraud may occur and not be detected. 
 The Registrant's management, with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the Registrant's disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. Based on that evaluation, the Registrant's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Registrant's disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
