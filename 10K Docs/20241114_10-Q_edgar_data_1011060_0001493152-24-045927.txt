 NOTES
TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

 SEPTEMBER

pursuant to an Asset Purchase Agreement entered into between us and Mitsubishi Chemical Performance
Polymers, Inc., a Delaware corporation MCPP ). Prior to the Closing Date, we developed and manufactured advanced polymer
materials which provided critical characteristics in the design and development of medical devices. Our biomaterials were marketed and
sold to medical device manufacturers who used our advanced polymers in devices designed for treating a broad range of anatomical sites
and disease states. 

As
a result of the Asset Sale, we ceased operating as a developer, manufacturer, marketer and seller of advanced polymers. Subsequent to
the Closing Date, we became engaged in efforts to identify either an (i) operating company to acquire or merge with through an equity-based
exchange transaction or (ii) investor interested in purchasing a majority interest in our common stock, whereby either transaction would
likely result in a change in control. 

On
March 3, 2020, we filed a Certificate of Amendment to the Company s Certificate of Incorporation, which amendment was unanimously
approved by our Board of Directors, to change our name from AdvanSource Biomaterials Corporation to EKIMAS Corporation. 

On

two tranches on October 12, 2021 and March 15, 2022. 

Pursuant
to the SPA, the Company effectuated a on March 11, 2022 (the Reverse Split ). Accordingly,
on a post-split basis, the shares purchased in connection with the First Closing resulted in Reddington owning shares of our common
stock. As set forth in the SPA, Reddington then purchased from us on March 15, 2022, an additional shares of our common stock,
on a post-split basis (the Second Closing ). After the issuance thereof Reddington owned shares of our common stock,
or approximately of our total shares of common stock outstanding. 

On
February 23, 2023, the Company and Managementselskabet af 12.08.2020 A/S (formerly Nordicus Partners A/S), a Danish stock corporation,

Pursuant to the Contribution Agreement the Sellers contributed, transferred, assigned and conveyed to the Company all right, title and
interest in and to one hundred percent of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Nordicus for an aggregate of shares
of the Company s common stock, par value per share. As a result of this transaction, Nordicus became a wholly owned
subsidiary of the Company. 

On
February 23, 2023, Tom Glaesner Larsen and Christian Hill Madsen were appointed directors of the Company. Mr. Hill-Madsen will continue
as Chairman of the Board of Orocidin A/S, of which the Company recently acquired of the outstanding shares in exchange for shares

Keller as his replacement. 

On

On

the effect of the computations is anti-dilutive due to the losses incurred. Accordingly, there is no difference in the amounts presented
for basic and diluted loss per share. 

of Orocidin A/S s equity interests, the remaining equity interests in Orocidin A/S are owned by unrelated
third parties, and the agreement with these third parties provides the Company with greater voting rights. Accordingly, the Company consolidates
its interest in the financial statements of Orocidin A/S under the VIE rules and reflects the third parties interests in the unaudited
consolidated financial statements as a non-controlling interest. The Company records this non-controlling interest at its initial fair
value, adjusting the basis prospectively for the third parties share of the respective consolidated investments net income
or loss or equity contributions and distributions. These non-controlling interests are not redeemable by the equity holders and are presented
as part of permanent equity. Income and losses are allocated to the non-controlling interest holders based on its economic ownership
percentage. Transactions with non-controlling interests that do not result in a loss of control are accounted for as equity transactions.
Any difference between the fair value of the consideration paid or received and the carrying amount of the non-controlling interest is
recognized in equity. 

Refer
to Note 9 Business Combinations for more information regarding non-controlling interest recognized related to the Orocidin
A/S business combination. 

as of September 30, 2024. As
a result, we expect our funds will not be sufficient to meet our needs for more than twelve months from the date of issuance of these
financial statements. Accordingly, there is substantial doubt about the ability to continue as a going concern. 

The
ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the Company s recent acquisition, its generating profitable operations
in the future and/or obtaining the necessary financing to meet its obligations and repay its liabilities arising from normal business
operations when they come due. Management intends to finance operating costs over the next twelve months with existing cash on hand,
the private placement of common stock and the exercise of outstanding warrants. The financial statements of the Company do not include
any adjustments that may result from the outcome of these uncertainties.

restricted shares of its common stock to GK Partners ApS. The shares were valued at ,

accounts for its investment under the guidance of ASC 321, Investments Equity
Securities, which provides guidance for equity interests that meet the definition of an equity security. Equity interests with
readily determinable fair values are carried at fair value with changes in value recorded in earnings. There currently is no
active market for the shares of Mag Mile Capital, Inc, therefore, the investment remains at cost until such time there is an
established fair value of Mag Mile Capital, Inc s shares to be used to adjust the value of the Company s investment in
those shares. The Company s investment in Mag Mile Capital, Inc is subject to changes
and fluctuations based on their business activities and their ability to trade in the future.

Item
3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 

Not
applicable. 

Item
4. Controls and Procedures 

Our
chief executive and financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024,
using the Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) developed by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission. The term disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed
to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed,
summarized, and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include,
without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports
that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company s management, including its chief
executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions to be made regarding required disclosure. It
should be noted that any system of controls and procedures, however well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, and not
absolute, assurance that the objectives of the system are met and that management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the
cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on this evaluation, our chief executive and financial officer concluded
that our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024, were not effective at the reasonable assurance level due to limited
resources in the finance and accounting functions. We intend to take appropriate and reasonable steps to make improvements to remediate
these deficiencies. 

Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

There
have not been any changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) under the Exchange
Act) during the fiscal period to which this report relates that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect,
our internal control over financial reporting.
