 Total revenues 
 
 The following discussion describes the nature, timing, and uncertainty of revenues and cash flows arising from the Company s contracts with customers. 
 Policy and Contract Charges 
 The Company earns revenue for providing distribution-related services to affiliated and unaffiliated mutual funds that are available as underlying investments in its variable annuity and variable life insurance products. The performance obligation is satisfied at the time the mutual fund is distributed. Revenue is recognized over the time the mutual fund is held in the variable product and is generally earned based on a fixed rate applied, as a percentage, to the net asset value of the fund. The revenue is not recognized at the time of sale because it is variably constrained due to factors outside the Company s control, including market volatility and how long the fund(s) remain in the insurance policy or annuity contract. The revenue will not be recognized until it is probable that a significant reversal will not occur. These fees are accrued and collected on a monthly basis. 
 Other Revenues 
 Administrative Fees 
 The Company earns revenue for providing customer support, contract servicing and administrative services for affiliated and unaffiliated mutual funds that are available as underlying instruments in its variable annuity and variable life insurance products. The transfer agent and administration revenue is earned daily based on a fixed rate applied, as a percentage, to assets under management. These performance obligations are considered a series of distinct services that are substantially the same and are satisfied each day over the contract term. These fees are accrued and collected on a monthly basis. 
 Other Fees 
 The Company earns revenue for providing affiliated and unaffiliated partners an opportunity to educate the financial advisors of its affiliate, Ameriprise Financial Services, LLC AFS ), that sell the Company's products as well as product and marketing personnel to support the offer, sale and servicing of funds within the Company's variable annuity and variable life insurance products. These payments allow the parties to train and support the advisors, explain the features of their products, and distribute marketing and educational materials. The affiliated revenue is earned based on a rate, updated at least annually, which is applied, as a percentage, to the market value of assets invested. The unaffiliated revenue is earned based on a fixed rate applied, as a percentage, to the market value of assets invested. These performance obligations are considered a series of distinct services that are substantially the same and are satisfied each day over the contract term. These fees are accrued and collected on a monthly basis.

 obligation to provide financial or other support to the non-consolidated VIEs beyond its initial investment and existing future funding commitments, and the Company has not provided any additional support to these entities. The Company has unfunded commitments related to consolidated CLOs of million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 Structured Investments 
 The Company invests in structured investments which are considered VIEs for which it is not the sponsor. These structured investments typically invest in fixed income instruments and are managed by third parties and include asset backed securities and commercial and residential mortgage backed securities. The Company classifies these investments as Available-for-Sale securities. The Company has determined that it is not the primary beneficiary of these structures due to the size of the Company s investment in the entities and position in the capital structure of these entities. 
 Additionally, the Company invests in CLOs for which it is the sponsor. CLOs are asset backed financing entities collateralized by a pool of assets, primarily syndicated loans and, to a lesser extent, high-yield bonds. Multiple tranches of debt securities are issued by a CLO, offering investors various maturity and credit risk characteristics. The debt securities issued by the CLOs are non-recourse to the Company. The CLO s debt holders have recourse only to the assets of the CLO. The assets of the CLOs cannot be used by the Company. Scheduled debt payments are based on the performance of the CLO s collateral pool. The Company earns management fees from the CLOs based on the value of the CLO s collateral pool and, in certain instances, may also receive incentive fees. The fee arrangement is at market and commensurate with the level of effort required to provide those services. The Company has invested in a portion of the unrated, junior subordinated notes and highly rated senior notes of certain CLOs. The Company consolidates certain CLOs where it is the primary beneficiary. 
 The Company s maximum exposure to loss with respect to structured investments and non-consolidated CLOs is limited to its amortized cost. The Company classifies these investments as Available-for-Sale securities. See Note 5 for additional information on these investments. 
 Affordable Housing Partnerships and Other Real Estate Partnerships 
 The Company is a limited partner in affordable housing partnerships that qualify for government-sponsored low income housing tax credit programs and partnerships that invest in multi-family residential properties that were originally developed with an affordable housing component. The Company has determined it is not the primary beneficiary and therefore does not consolidate these partnerships. 
 A majority of the limited partnerships are VIEs. The Company s maximum exposure to loss as a result of its investment in the VIEs is limited to the carrying value. The carrying value is reflected in Other investments and was million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The Company s liability related to original purchase commitments not yet remitted to the VIEs was not material as of both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The Company has not provided any additional support and is not contractually obligated to provide additional support to the VIEs beyond the funding commitments. 
 Fair Value of Assets and Liabilities 
 The Company categorizes its fair value measurements according to a three-level hierarchy. See Note 12 for the definition of the three levels of the fair value hierarchy.

 Securities and loans transferred from Level 3 primarily represent assets with fair values that are now obtained from a third-party pricing service with observable inputs or priced in active markets. Securities and loans transferred to Level 3 represent assets with fair values that are now based on a single non-binding broker quote. 
 All Level 3 measurements as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were obtained from non-binding broker quotes where unobservable inputs utilized in the fair value calculation are not reasonably available to the Company. 
 Determination of Fair Value 
 Assets 
 Investments 
 The fair value of syndicated loans obtained from third-party pricing services using a market approach with observable inputs is classified as Level 2. The fair value of syndicated loans obtained from third-party pricing services with a single non-binding broker quote as the underlying valuation source is classified as Level 3. The underlying inputs used in non-binding broker quotes are not readily available to the Company. See Note 12 for a description of the Company s determination of the fair value of corporate debt securities, common stocks and other investments. 
 Receivables 
 For receivables of the consolidated CLOs, the carrying value approximates fair value as the nature of these assets has historically been short-term and the receivables have been collectible. The fair value of these receivables is classified as Level 2. 
 Liabilities 
 Debt 
 The fair value of the CLOs assets, typically syndicated bank loans, is more observable than the fair value of the CLOs debt tranches for which market activity is limited and less transparent. As a result, the fair value of the CLOs debt is set equal to the fair value of the CLOs assets and is classified as Level 2. 
 Other Liabilities 
 Other liabilities consist primarily of securities purchased but not yet settled by consolidated CLOs. The carrying value approximates fair value as the nature of these liabilities has historically been short-term. The fair value of these liabilities is classified as Level 2. Other liabilities also include accrued interest on CLO debt. 
 Fair Value Option 
 The Company has elected the fair value option for the financial assets and liabilities of the consolidated CLOs. Management believes that the use of the fair value option better matches the changes in fair value of assets and liabilities related to the CLOs.

 As part of the Company s ongoing monitoring process, management determined that the decrease in total gross unrealized losses on its Available-for-Sale securities for which an allowance for credit losses has not been recognized during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 is primarily attributable to the impact of lower interest rates. As of September 30, 2024, the Company did not recognize these unrealized losses in earnings because it was determined that such losses were due to non-credit factors. The Company does not intend to sell these securities and does not believe that it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell these securities before the anticipated recovery of the remaining amortized cost basis.

 (1) The utilization of guaranteed withdrawals represents the percentage of contractholders that will begin withdrawing in any given year. The weighted average utilization rate represents the average assumption, weighted based on the benefit base. The calculation excludes policies that have already started taking withdrawals. 
 (2) The weighted average surrender rate represents the average assumption weighted based on the account value of each contract. 
 (3) Market volatility represents the implied volatility of each contractholder s mix of funds. The weighted average market volatility represents the average volatility across all contracts, weighted by the size of the guaranteed benefit. 
 (4) The nonperformance risk is the spread added to the U.S. Treasury curve. 
 (5) The weighted average mortality rate represents the average assumption weighted based on the account value of each contract. 
 Changes to Significant Inputs and Assumptions: 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and year ended December 31, 2023, the Company updated inputs and assumptions based on management s review of experience studies. These updates resulted in the following notable changes in the fair value estimates of market risk benefits calculations: 
 Nine months ended September 30, 2024 
 Updates to utilization of guaranteed withdrawal assumptions resulted in a decrease to pre-tax income of million. 
 Updates to surrender assumptions resulted in a decrease to pre-tax income of million. 
 Year ended December 31, 2023 
 Updates to utilization of guaranteed withdrawal assumptions resulted in a decrease to pre-tax income of million. 
 Updates to surrender assumptions resulted in a decrease to pre-tax income of million. 
 Refer to the rollforward of market risk benefits for the impacts of changes to interest rate, equity market, volatility and nonperformance risk assumptions. 
 Uncertainty of Fair Value Measurements 
 Significant increases (decreases) in utilization and volatility used in the fair value measurement of market risk benefits in isolation would have resulted in a significantly higher (lower) liability value. 
 Significant increases (decreases) in nonperformance risk and surrender assumptions used in the fair value measurement of market risk benefits in isolation would have resulted in a significantly lower (higher) liability value. 
 Significant increases (decreases) in mortality assumptions used in the fair value measurement of the death benefit portion of market risk benefits in isolation would have resulted in a significantly higher (lower) liability value whereas significant increases (decreases) in mortality rates used in the fair value measurement of the life contingent portion of market risk benefits in isolation would have resulted in a significantly lower (higher) liability value. 
 Surrender assumptions, utilization assumptions and mortality assumptions vary with the type of base product, type of rider, duration of the policy, age of the contractholder, calendar year of the projection, previous withdrawal history, and the relationship between the value of the guaranteed benefit and the contract accumulation value. 
 Determination of Fair Value 
 The Company values market risk benefits using internal valuation models. These models include observable capital market assumptions and significant unobservable inputs related to implied volatility, contractholder behavior assumptions that include margins for risk, and the Company s nonperformance risk. These measurements are classified as Level 3.

 Level 3 measurements not included in the tables above are obtained from non-binding broker quotes where unobservable inputs utilized in the fair value calculation are not reasonably available to the Company or fair values estimated based on a transaction near the balance sheet date. 
 Uncertainty of Fair Value Measurements 
 Significant increases (decreases) in the yield/spread to U.S. Treasuries used in the fair value measurement of Level 3 corporate debt securities and asset backed securities in isolation would have resulted in a significantly lower (higher) fair value measurement. 
 Significant increases (decreases) in the annual default rate, loss severity, and constant prepayment rate used in the fair value measurement of Level 3 asset backed securities in isolation, generally, would have resulted in a significantly lower (higher) fair value measurement and significant increases (decreases) in loss severity in isolation would have resulted in a significantly lower (higher) fair value measurement. 
 Significant increases (decreases) in the surrender assumption used in the fair value measurement of the fixed deferred indexed annuity ceded embedded derivatives in isolation would have resulted in a significantly lower (higher) fair value measurement. 
 Significant increases (decreases) in nonperformance risk used in the fair value measurement of the IUL embedded derivatives in isolation would have resulted in a significantly lower (higher) fair value measurement. 
 Significant increases (decreases) in nonperformance risk and surrender assumption used in the fair value measurements of the fixed deferred indexed annuity embedded derivatives and structured variable annuity embedded derivatives in isolation would have resulted in a significantly lower (higher) liability value. 
 Determination of Fair Value 
 The Company uses valuation techniques consistent with the market and income approaches to measure the fair value of its assets and liabilities. The Company s market approach uses prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities. The Company s income approach uses valuation techniques to convert future projected cash flows to a single discounted present value amount. When applying either approach, the Company maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs. 
 The following is a description of the valuation techniques used to measure fair value and the general classification of these instruments pursuant to the fair value hierarchy. 
 Assets 
 Available-for-Sale Securities 
 When available, the fair value of securities is based on quoted prices in active markets. If quoted prices are not available, fair values are obtained from third-party pricing services, non-binding broker quotes, or other model-based valuation techniques. 
 Level 1 securities primarily include U.S. Treasuries. 
 Level 2 securities primarily include corporate bonds, residential mortgage backed securities, commercial mortgage backed securities, state and municipal obligations, asset backed securities and foreign government securities. The fair value of these Level 2 securities is based on a market approach with prices obtained from third-party pricing services. Observable inputs used to value these securities can include, but are not limited to, reported trades, benchmark yields, issuer spreads and non-binding broker quotes. The fair value of securities included in an observable transaction with a market participant are also considered Level 2 when the market is not active. 
 Level 3 securities primarily include certain corporate bonds, non-agency residential mortgage backed securities and asset backed securities with fair value typically based on a single non-binding broker quote. The underlying inputs used for some of the non-binding broker quotes are not readily available to the Company. The Company s privately placed corporate bonds are typically based on a single non-binding broker quote. The fair value of affiliated asset backed securities is determined using a discounted cash flow model. Inputs used to determine the expected cash flows include assumptions about discount rates and default, prepayment and recovery rates of the underlying assets. Given the significance of the unobservable inputs to this fair value measurement, the fair value of the investment in the affiliated asset backed securities is classified as Level 3. 
 Management is responsible for the fair values recorded on the financial statements. Prices received from third-party pricing services are subjected to exception reporting that identifies investments with significant daily price movements as well as no movements. The Company reviews the exception reporting and resolves the exceptions through reaffirmation of the price or recording an appropriate fair value estimate. The Company also performs subsequent transaction testing. The Company performs annual due diligence of third-party pricing services. The Company s due diligence procedures include assessing the vendor s valuation qualifications, control environment, analysis of asset-class specific valuation methodologies, and understanding of sources of market observable assumptions

 In the tables above, the amount of assets or liabilities presented are offset first by financial instruments that have the right of offset under master netting or similar arrangements, then any remaining amount is reduced by the amount of cash and securities collateral. The actual collateral may be greater than amounts presented in the tables. 
 When the fair value of collateral accepted by the Company is less than the amount due to the Company, there is a risk of loss if the counterparty fails to perform or provide additional collateral. To mitigate this risk, the Company monitors collateral values regularly and requires additional collateral when necessary. When the value of collateral pledged by the Company declines, it may be required to post additional collateral. 
 Freestanding derivative instruments are reflected in Other assets and Other liabilities. Cash collateral pledged by the Company is reflected in Other assets and cash collateral accepted by the Company is reflected in Other liabilities.

 (1) 2024 amounts represent the amounts payable and receivable for the period from October 1, 2024 to December 31, 2024. 
 Actual timing and payment amounts may differ due to future settlements, modifications or exercises of the contracts prior to the full premium being paid or received. 
 Structured variable annuity and IUL products have returns tied to the performance of equity markets. As a result of fluctuations in equity markets, the obligation incurred by the Company related to structured variable annuity and IUL products will positively or negatively impact earnings over the life of these products. The equity components of structured variable annuity and IUL product obligations are considered embedded derivatives, which are bifurcated from their host contracts for valuation purposes and reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value with changes in fair value reported in earnings. As a means of economically hedging its obligations under the provisions of these products, the Company enters into interest rate swaps, index options and futures contracts. 
 As discussed in Note 10, the Company issues variable annuity contracts that provide protection to contractholders from other-than-nominal capital market risk and expose the Company to other-than-nominal capital market risk. The Company economically hedges its obligations under these market risk benefits using options, swaptions, swaps and futures. 
 Credit Risk 
 Credit risk associated with the Company s derivatives is the risk that a derivative counterparty will not perform in accordance with the terms of the applicable derivative contract. To mitigate such risk, the Company has established guidelines and oversight of credit risk through a comprehensive enterprise risk management program that includes members of senior management. Key components of this program are to require preapproval of counterparties and the use of master netting and collateral arrangements whenever practical. See Note 13 for additional information on the Company s credit exposure related to derivative assets. 
 Certain of the Company s derivative contracts contain provisions that adjust the level of collateral the Company is required to post based on the Company s financial strength rating (or based on the debt rating of the Company s parent, Ameriprise Financial). Additionally, certain of the Company s derivative contracts contain provisions that allow the counterparty to terminate the contract if the Company does not maintain a specific financial strength rating or Ameriprise Financial s debt does not maintain a specific credit rating (generally an investment grade rating). If these termination provisions were to be triggered, the Company s counterparty could require immediate settlement of any net liability position. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the aggregate fair value of derivative contracts in a net liability position containing such credit contingent provisions was million and million, respectively. The aggregate fair value of assets posted as collateral for such instruments as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was million and million, respectively. If the credit contingent provisions of derivative contracts in a net liability position as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were triggered, the aggregate fair value of additional assets that would be required to be posted as collateral or needed to settle the instruments immediately would have been million and million, respectively.

 The Company recorded a pretax loss for the three months ended September 30, 2024. Tax benefits applied to a pretax loss raise the effective tax rate. The effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was higher than the statutory rate as a result of tax preferred items including the dividends received deduction and low income housing tax credits, partially offset by an increase in state income taxes, net of federal benefit. The effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was lower than the statutory rate as a result of tax preferred items including the dividends received deduction, foreign tax credits, net of addback, and low income housing tax credits, partially offset by the impact of projected pretax income for the full year ending December 31, 2024 relative to actual year-to-date pretax income and state income taxes, net of federal benefit. 
 The effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2023 was lower than the statutory rate primarily due to tax preferred items including low income housing tax credits and the dividends received deduction. The effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was lower than the statutory rate as a result of tax preferred items including foreign tax credits, net of addback, the dividends received deduction, and low income housing tax credits, as well as the benefit of an audit closure partially offset by an increase in unrecognized tax benefits. 
 The increase in the effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to a pretax loss in the current period and the related impact on tax preferred items. 
 The increase in the effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to the impact of an increase in projected pretax income for the full year ending December 31, 2024 compared to the prior year, a decrease in foreign tax credits, net of addback, the benefit of an audit closure in the prior period, an increase in state

 million, net of federal benefit, which will expire beginning December 31, 2024. 
 The Company is required to establish a valuation allowance for any portion of its deferred tax assets that management believes will not be realized. Significant judgment is required in determining if a valuation allowance should be established and the amount of such allowance if required. Factors used in making this determination include estimates relating to the performance of the business. Consideration is given to, among other things in making this determination: (i) future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforward; (ii) future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences; (iii) taxable income in prior carryback years; and (iv) tax planning strategies. Based on analysis of the Company s tax position as of September 30, 2024, management believes it is more likely than not that the Company will not realize certain state net operating losses of million and state deferred tax assets of million, both net of federal benefit; therefore, a valuation allowance has been established. The valuation allowance was million and million, net of federal benefit, as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had million and million, respectively, of gross unrecognized tax benefits. If recognized, approximately million and million, net of federal tax benefits, of unrecognized tax benefits as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, would affect the effective tax rate. During the second quarter of 2023, the Company had additions to its gross unrecognized tax benefits for tax positions of prior years of million and reductions to its gross unrecognized tax benefits of prior years of million. 
 It is reasonably possible that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits will change in the next 12 months. The Company estimates that the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits will decrease in the next 12 months. 
 The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of the income tax provision. The Company recognized and a net increase of million in interest and penalties for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. The Company recognized and a net increase of million in interest and penalties for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively.

 Overall 
 Net income decreased 120 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year period. Pretax income decreased 117 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year period. 
 The following impacts were significant drivers of the period-over-period change in pretax income: 
 The market impact on non-traditional long-duration products (including variable and fixed deferred annuity contracts and universal life UL insurance contracts), net of hedges and the reinsurance accrual was an expense of 322 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to an expense of 137 million for the prior year period. 
 The favorable impact of the trend in rising investment portfolio yields, along with higher average balances due to the growth in structured variable annuities SVA ). 
 Variable annuity account balances increased 17 to 87.7 billion as of September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year period due to market appreciation, partially offset by net outflows of 3.5 billion. Variable annuity sales increased 29 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year period primarily reflecting an increase in sales of SVAs. Account values with living benefit riders declined to 51 as of September 30, 2024 compared to 55 a year ago reflecting management s actions to optimize the Company s business mix. This trend is expected to continue and meaningfully shift the mix of business away from products with living benefit guarantees over time. 
 Fixed deferred annuity account balances declined 11 to 5.8 billion as of September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year period as policies continue to lapse and the Company previously discontinued new sales of fixed deferred annuities and fixed index annuities. 
 In the third quarter of the year, management conducted its annual review of life insurance, annuity and LTC valuation assumptions relative to current experience and management expectations including modeling changes. These annual assumption updates are collectively referred to as unlocking throughout this document.

 The primary driver of the unlocking impact was lowered surrender assumptions on variable annuities with living benefits resulting in an expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, partially offset by the updated claims incident rates on disability insurance. The primary driver of the unlocking impact was lowered surrender assumptions on variable annuities with living benefits resulting in an expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Revenues 
 Premiums increased 46 million, or 14 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year period primarily due to higher sales of life contingent payout annuities. 
 Net investment income increased 183 million, or 19 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year period reflecting the favorable impact of the trend in rising investment portfolio yields, along with higher average balances due to the growth in SVAs. 
 Net realized investment losses were 43 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to net realized investment losses of 58 million for the prior year period. The nine months ended September 30, 2024 included net realized losses of 46 million on investments held by CIEs. The net realized investment losses for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 included net realized losses of 27 million on Available-for-Sale securities, driven by the fixed maturity investment portfolio repositioning and net realized losses of 32 million on investments held by CIEs. 
 Benefits and Expenses 
 Benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses increased 309 million, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year period primarily reflecting a 130 million increase in expense from market impacts on SVA embedded derivative, net of hedges in place to offset those risks. This increase was primarily the result of a favorable 804 million change in the market impact on derivatives hedging the SVA embedded derivative and an unfavorable 916 million change in the market impact on SVA embedded derivative. The main market driver contributing to these changes was the equity market impact on the SVA embedded derivative net of the impact on the corresponding hedge assets resulted in a higher expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year period. This increase also reflects the impact of higher sales of life contingent payout annuities and increased volume in SVAs. 
 Interest credited to fixed accounts decreased 29 million, or 6 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year period primarily reflecting the following items: 
 A 39 million decrease in expense from other market impacts on indexed universal life IUL benefits, net of hedges, which was a benefit of 23 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to an expense of 16 million for the prior year period. The decrease in expense was primarily due to a decrease in the IUL embedded derivative in the prior period, which reflected model changes and more discounting due to higher Treasury rates, partially offset by higher option costs due to a higher option budget. 
 A 23 million increase in expense from the unhedged nonperformance credit spread risk adjustment on IUL benefits. The unfavorable impact of the nonperformance credit spread was 17 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to a favorable impact of 6 million for the prior year period.

 Change in fair value of market risk benefits increased 100 million, or 18 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year period primarily reflecting the following items: 
 A 69 million increase in expense from market impacts on variable annuity guaranteed benefits, net of hedges in place to offset those risks. This increase was the result of an unfavorable 437 million change in the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed benefits reserves and a favorable 392 million change in the market impact on derivatives hedging the variable annuity guaranteed benefits. The main market drivers contributing to these changes are summarized below: 
 Equity market impact on the variable annuity guaranteed benefits liability net of the impact on the corresponding hedge assets resulted in a higher benefit for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year period. 
 Interest rate and bond impact on the variable annuity guaranteed benefits liability net of the impact on the corresponding hedge assets resulted in an expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to a benefit for the prior year period. 
 Volatility impact on the variable annuity guaranteed benefits liability net of the impact on the corresponding hedge assets resulted in a higher expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year period. 
 Other unhedged items, including the difference between the assumed and actual underlying separate account investment performance, transaction costs and various behavioral items, were a lower net expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year period. 
 Income Taxes 
 The Company s effective tax rate was 10.8 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 7.9 for the prior year period. The increase in the effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to the impact of an increase in projected pretax income for the full year ending December 31, 2024 compared to the prior year, a decrease in foreign tax credits, net of addback, the benefit of an audit closure in the prior period, an increase in state income taxes, net of federal benefit, and a decrease in low income housing tax credits, partially offset by a decrease in unrecognized tax benefits. See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion on income taxes. 
 
 Market Risk 
 The Company s primary market risk exposures are interest rate, equity price and credit risk. Equity price and interest rate fluctuations can have a significant impact on the Company s results of operations, primarily due to the effects they have on asset-based fees and expenses, the spread income generated on the fixed portion of its variable annuities and variable insurance contracts, fixed annuity and insurance contracts, the value of market risk benefits and other liabilities associated with its variable annuities and the value of derivatives held to hedge related benefits. 
 Market risk benefits continue to be managed by utilizing a hedging program which attempts to match the sensitivity of the assets with the sensitivity of the benefits. This approach works with the premise that matched sensitivities will produce a highly effective hedging result. The Company s comprehensive hedging program focuses mainly on first order sensitivities of assets and liabilities: Equity Market Level (Delta), Interest Rate Level (Rho) and Volatility (Vega). Additionally, various second order sensitivities are managed. The Company uses various options, swaptions, swaps and futures to manage risk exposures. The exposures are measured and monitored daily, and adjustments to the hedge portfolio are made as necessary. 
 To evaluate interest rate and equity price risk, the Company performs sensitivity testing which measures the impact on pretax income from the sources listed below for a 12-month period following a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates or a hypothetical 10 decline in equity prices. The interest rate risk test assumes a sudden 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve, with rates then staying at those levels for the next 12 months. The equity price risk test assumes a sudden 10 drop in equity prices, with equity prices then staying at those levels for the next 12 months. In estimating the values of variable annuities, indexed annuities, IUL insurance and the associated hedging instruments, the Company assumed no change in implied market volatility despite the 10 drop in equity prices.

 The following tables present the Company s estimate of the impact on pretax income from the above defined hypothetical market movements as of September 30, 2024:

 (1) Excludes incentive income which is impacted by market and fund performance during the period and cannot be readily estimated. 
 The above results compare to an estimated negative net impact to pretax income of 69 million related to a 10 equity price decline and an estimated positive net impact to pretax income of 527 million related to a 100 basis point increase in interest rates as of December 31, 2023. 
 Net impacts shown in the above tables from market risk benefits result largely from differences between the liability valuation basis and the hedging basis. Liabilities are valued using fair value accounting principles, with risk margins incorporated in contractholder behavior assumptions. The Company s hedging is based on its determination of economic risk, which excludes certain items in the liability valuation. 
 Actual results could and likely will differ materially from those illustrated above as fair values have a number of estimates and assumptions. For example, the illustration above includes assuming that implied market volatility does not change when equity prices fall by 10 and that the 100 basis point increase in interest rates is a parallel shift of the yield curve. Furthermore, the Company has not tried to anticipate changes in client preferences for different types of assets or other changes in client behavior, nor has the Company tried to anticipate all strategic actions management might take to increase revenues or reduce expenses in these scenarios. 
 The selection of a 100 basis point interest rate increase as well as a 10 equity price decline should not be construed as a prediction of future market events. Impacts of larger or smaller changes in interest rates or equity prices will not be proportional to those shown for a 100 basis point increase in interest rates or a 10 decline in equity prices. 
 Fixed Annuities, Fixed Insurance and Fixed Portion of Variable Annuities and Variable Insurance Contracts 
 The Company s earnings from fixed deferred annuities, fixed insurance, and the fixed portion of variable annuities and variable insurance contracts are based upon the spread between rates earned on assets held and the rates at which interest is credited to accounts. The Company primarily invests in fixed rate securities to fund the rate credited to clients. The Company guarantees an interest rate to the holders of these products. Investment assets and client liabilities generally differ as it relates to basis, repricing or maturity characteristics. Rates credited to clients accounts generally reset at shorter intervals than the yield on the underlying investments. Therefore, in an increasing interest rate environment, higher interest rates may be reflected in crediting rates to clients sooner than in rates earned on invested assets, which could result in a reduced spread between the two rates, reduced earned income and a negative impact on pretax income. While interest rates under the current environment have relieved some pressure from the liability guaranteed minimum interest rates GMIRs ), there are still some GMIRs above current levels. Hence, liability credited rates 
 61 

Index 
 RIVERSOURCE LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY 

 will move more slowly under a modest rise in interest rates while projected asset purchases would capture the full increase in interest rates. This dynamic would result in widening spreads under a modestly rising rate scenario given the current relationship between the current level of interest rates and the underlying GMIRs on the business. Of the 41.3 billion in Policyholder account balances, future policy benefits and claims as of September 30, 2024, 16.2 billion is related to liabilities created by these products. The Company does not hedge this exposure. 
 As a result of the current market environment, reinvestment yields are becoming more aligned with the current portfolio yield. The Company would expect the recent decline in its portfolio income yields to slow and begin to stabilize in future periods under the current environment. The carrying value and weighted average yield of non-structured fixed maturity securities and commercial mortgage loans that may generate proceeds to reinvest through September 30, 2026 due to prepayment, maturity or call activity at the option of the issuer, excluding securities with a make-whole provision, were 863 million and 4.5 , respectively, as of September 30, 2024. In addition, residential mortgage backed securities, which can be subject to prepayment risk under a low interest rate environment, totaled 4.0 billion and had a weighted average yield of 4.3 as of September 30, 2024. While these amounts represent investments that could be subject to reinvestment risk, it is also possible that these investments will be used to fund liabilities or may not be prepaid and will remain invested at their current yields. In addition to the interest rate environment, the mix of benefit payments versus product sales as well as the timing and volumes associated with such mix may impact the Company s investment yield. Furthermore, reinvestment activities and the associated investment yield may also be impacted by corporate strategies implemented at management s discretion. The average yield for investment purchases during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was approximately 5.5 . 
 The reinvestment of proceeds from maturities, calls and prepayments at rates near the current portfolio yield will have a limited impact to future operating results. In this volatile rate environment, the Company assesses reinvestment risk in its investment portfolio and monitors this risk in accordance with its asset/liability management framework. In addition, the Company may update the crediting rates on its fixed products when warranted, subject to guaranteed minimums. 
 See Note 8 for more information on the account values of fixed deferred annuities, fixed insurance, and the fixed portion of variable annuities and variable insurance contracts by range of GMIRs and the range of the difference between rates credited to policyholders and contractholders as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 and the respective guaranteed minimums, as well as the percentage of account values subject to rate reset in the time period indicated. 
 
 Fair Value Measurements 
 The Company reports certain assets and liabilities at fair value; specifically, separate account assets, derivatives, market risk benefits, embedded derivatives, and most investments and cash equivalents. Fair value assumes the exchange of assets or liabilities occurs in orderly transactions and is not the result of a forced liquidation or distressed sale. The Company includes actual market prices, or observable inputs, in its fair value measurements to the extent available. Broker quotes are obtained when quotes from pricing services are not available. The Company validates prices obtained from third parties through a variety of means such as: price variance analysis, subsequent sales testing, stale price review, price comparison across pricing vendors and due diligence reviews of vendors. See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the Company s fair value measurements. 
 Fair Value of Liabilities and Nonperformance Risk 
 Companies are required to measure the fair value of liabilities at the price that would be received to transfer the liability to a market participant (an exit price). Since there is not a market for the Company s obligations of its market risk benefits, fixed deferred indexed annuities, structured variable annuities, and IUL insurance, the Company considers the assumptions participants in a hypothetical market would make to reflect an exit price. As a result, the Company adjusts the valuation of market risk benefits, fixed deferred indexed annuities, structured variable annuities, and IUL insurance by updating certain contractholder assumptions, adding explicit margins to provide for risk, and adjusting the rates used to discount expected cash flows to reflect a current market estimate of the Company s nonperformance risk. The nonperformance risk adjustment is based on observable market data adjusted to estimate the risk of the Company not fulfilling these liabilities. Consistent with general market conditions, this estimate resulted in a spread over the U.S. Treasury curve as of September 30, 2024. As the Company s estimate of this spread widens or tightens, the liability will decrease or increase, respectively. If this nonperformance credit spread moves to a zero spread over the U.S. Treasury curve, the reduction to future total equity would be approximately 639 million, net of the reinsurance accrual and income taxes (calculated at the statutory tax rate of 21 ), based on September 30, 2024 credit spreads. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Liquidity Strategy 
 The liquidity requirements of the Company are generally met by funds provided by investment income, maturities and periodic repayments of investments, premiums and proceeds from sales of investments, fixed annuity and fixed insurance deposits as well as capital contributions from its parent, Ameriprise Financial Inc. Ameriprise Financial ). Other liquidity sources the Company has established are short-term borrowings and available lines of credit with Ameriprise Financial aggregating 839 million.

Index 
 RIVERSOURCE LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY 

 The Company enters into short-term borrowings, which may include repurchase agreements and Federal Home Loan Bank FHLB advances to reduce reinvestment risk. Short-term borrowings allow the Company to receive cash to reinvest in longer-duration assets, while maintaining the flexibility to pay back the short-term debt with cash flows generated by the fixed income portfolio. RiverSource Life Insurance Company is a member of the FHLB of Des Moines, which provides RiverSource Life Insurance Company access to collateralized borrowings. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had estimated maximum borrowing capacity of 3.9 billion and 4.0 billion, respectively, under the FHLB facility, of which 201 million was outstanding as of both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 and is collateralized with commercial mortgage backed securities and residential mortgage backed securities. 
 There have been no material changes to the Company s contractual obligations disclosed in the Company s 2023 10-K. 
 See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information about the Company s long-term debt. 
 The primary uses of funds are policy benefits, commissions, other product-related acquisition and sales inducement costs, operating expenses, policy loans, dividends to Ameriprise Financial and investment purchases. The Company routinely reviews its sources and uses of funds in order to meet its ongoing obligations, including reinsurance arrangements. The Company believes these cash flows will be sufficient to fund its short-term and long-term operating liquidity needs and dividends to Ameriprise Financial. Specific to reinsurance counterparties, in 2009, the Company established an agreement to protect its exposure to Genworth Life Insurance Company GLIC for its reinsured LTC. In 2016, substantial enhancements to this reinsurance protection agreement were finalized. The terms of these confidential provisions within the agreement have been shared, in the normal course of regular reviews, with the Company s domiciliary regulator and rating agencies. GLIC is domiciled in Delaware, so in the event GLIC were subjected to rehabilitation or insolvency proceedings, such proceedings would be located in (and governed by) Delaware laws. Delaware courts have a long tradition of respecting commercial and reinsurance affairs as well as contracts among sophisticated parties. Similar credit protections to what the Company has with GLIC have been tested and respected in Delaware and elsewhere in the United States, and as a result the Company believes its credit protections would be respected even in the unlikely event that GLIC becomes subject to rehabilitation or insolvency proceedings in Delaware. Accordingly, while no credit protections are perfect, the Company believes the correct way to think about the risks represented by its counterparty credit exposure to GLIC is not the full amount of the gross liability that GLIC reinsures, but a much smaller net exposure to GLIC (if any that might exist after taking into account the Company s credit protections). Thus, management believes that this agreement and offsetting non-LTC legacy arrangements with Genworth Financial, Inc. will enable the Company to recover on all net exposure in all material respects in the event of a rehabilitation or insolvency of GLIC.
