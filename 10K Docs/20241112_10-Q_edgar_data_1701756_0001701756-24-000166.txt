 During the first three quarters of 2024, assets related to our Sadot food services segment met the criteria for classification as Assets Held for Sale. For additional information, see Note 2 Significant accounting policies and Note 3 Assets held for sale. 
 
 With the creation of our Sadot LLC subsidiary in late 2022, we began to transform from a U.S.-centric restaurant business into a global, food-focused organization with distinct segments. As a result, we have reevaluated and changed our operating segments late in 2023 to align with our distinct segments. Previously we split out Muscle Maker Grill, Pokemoto, and SuperFit Foods as their own restaurant operating segments. With the transformation of our business into a global, food-focused organization, we operate the business in distinct business segments Sadot Agri-Foods and Sadot Food Service.

 OVERVIEW 
 Sadot Group Inc. is our parent company and is headquartered in Burleson, Texas. In late 2022, Sadot Group began a transformation from a U.S.-centric restaurant business into a global organization focused on the Agri-foods supply-chain. As of September 30, 2024, Sadot Group consisted of two distinct operating units. 
 1. Sadot LLC Sadot Agri-Foods ): Sadot Group s largest operating unit is a global Agri-Foods company engaged in farming, commodity trading and shipping of food and feed (e.g., soybean meal, wheat and corn) via dry bulk cargo ships across the globe. Sadot Agri-Foods competes with the ABCD commodity companies (ADM, Bunge, Cargill, Louis-Dreyfus) as well as many regional organizations. Sadot Agri-Foods operates, through a majority owned subsidiary, a roughly 5,000 acre crop producing farm in Zambia with a focus on major commodities such as wheat, soy and corn alongside high-value tree crops such as avocado and mango. Sadot Agri-Foods was formed as part of the Company s diversification strategy to own and operate, through its subsidiaries, the business lines throughout the food supply chain. Sadot Agri-Foods seeks to diversify over time into a sustainable and forward-looking global agri-foods company. 
 2. Sadot Restaurant Group, LLC ("Sadot Food Services"): has three unique healthier for you concepts, including two fast casual restaurant concepts, Pok moto and Muscle Maker Grill, plus one subscription-based fresh prep meal concept, SuperFit Foods. SuperFit Foods was sold in August 2024. The restaurants were founded on the belief of taking every-day menu options and converting them into healthier for you menu choices. Consumers are demanding healthier choices, customization, flavor and convenience. Each of our concepts offers different menus that are tailored to specific consumer segments. We believe our concepts deliver highly differentiated

 Our gross profit totaled 4.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 10.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Working Capital 
 We measure our liquidity in a number of ways, including the following: 
 As of September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 000 000 Cash 962 1,354 Accounts Receivable, net 38,333 52,920 Inventory 1,054 2,561 Other current assets 113,241 56,016 Assets held for sale (4)

 Availability of Additional Funds 
 Our main financial objectives are to prudently manage financial risk, ensure access to liquidity and minimize cost of capital in order to efficiently finance our business and maintain balance sheet strength. We generally finance our ongoing operations with cash flows generated from operations, borrowings under various credit facilities and term loans. At September 30, 2024, current ratio, which equals Total current assets divided by Total current liabilities, was 1.14, an increase of 0.06, compared to current ratio of 1.08 at December 31, 2023. The increase in current ratio was primarily due to an increase in other current assets, a decrease in Accounts payable and accrued expenses and increase in Assets held for sale, partially offset by an increase in other current liabilities and a decrease in Accounts receivable. At September 30, 2024, working capital, which equals Total current assets less Total current liabilities, was 18.9 million an increase of 10.7 million, compared to working capital of 8.3 million at December 31, 2023. The increase in working capital was primarily due to an increase in other current assets, a decrease in Accounts payable and accrued expenses and an increase in cash, partially offset by an increase in other current liabilities and a decrease in Accounts receivable. The Company believes that our existing cash on hand, current accounts receivable and future cash flows from our commodity trading, farming and franchise operations, will be sufficient to fund our operations, anticipated capital expenditures and repayment obligations over the next 12 months. 
 In the event we are required to obtain additional financing, either through borrowings, private placements, public offerings, or some type of business combination, such as a merger, or buyout, and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in such pursuits. We may be unable to acquire the additional funding necessary to continue operating. Accordingly, if we are unable to generate adequate cash from operations, and if we are unable to find sources of funding, it may be necessary for us to sell one or more lines of business or all or a portion of our assets, enter into a business combination or reduce or eliminate operations. These possibilities, to the extent available, may be on terms that result in significant dilution to our shareholders or that result in our shareholders losing all of their investment in our Company.

 We will need to raise additional capital. Such additional capital may not be available nor may the terms of such capital be generally acceptable. In addition, any future sale of our equity securities could dilute the ownership and control of your shares and could be at prices substantially below prices at which our shares currently trade. We may seek to increase our cash reserves through the sale of additional equity or debt securities. The sale of convertible debt securities or additional equity securities could result in additional and potentially substantial dilution to our shareholders. The incurrence of indebtedness would result in increased debt service obligations and could result in operating and financing covenants that would restrict our operations and liquidity. In addition, our ability to obtain additional capital on acceptable terms is subject to a variety of uncertainties. We cannot assure you that financing will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all. Any failure to raise additional funds on favorable terms could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and financial condition. 
 Sources and Uses of Cash for the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, Net cash provided by operating activities was 7.0 million compared to a use of 8.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Our Net cash provided for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was primarily attributable to our Net income of 3.1 million, adjusted for net non-cash income in the aggregate amount of 1.8 million and 2.1 million of Net cash used by changes in the levels of operating assets and liabilities. Our Net cash used for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, was primarily attributable to our Net loss of 6.2 million, adjusted for net non-cash income in the aggregate amount of 9.0 million and 11.5 million of Net cash used in changes in the levels of operating assets and liabilities. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, Net cash used in investing activities was 5.4 million, of which 5.9 million was the deposit on farmland and 38.0 thousand used in the purchase of property and equipment, partially offset by 0.5 million from the disposal of property and equipment. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, Net cash used in investing activities was 3.7 million, of which 12.4 million was used to purchase Property and equipment, partially offset by 4.9 million provided by the closing out of the deposit of the farmland and an Investment in a non-controlling interest of 3.7 million for the farm. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, Net cash used in financing activities was 1.9 million, consisting of repayments of various other notes payable of 6.5 million partially offset by proceeds from notes payable of 4.6 million. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, Net cash provided by financing activities was 4.9 million, consisting of 7.7 million of proceeds from notes payable and 2.2 million proceeds from exercise of warrants, partially offset by repayments of various other notes payable of 5.0 million. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 Our accounting policies are more fully described in Note 2 Significant accounting policies to our consolidated financial statements included as part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. As disclosed in Note 2, the preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make substantial judgment or estimation in their application that may significantly affect reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. We believe the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies, which are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require management's most difficult, subjective and complex judgments. 
 
 Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements 
 In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, as amended subsequently by ASUs 2018-19, 2019-04, 2019-05, 2019-10, 2019-11 and 2020-03. The guidance in the ASUs requires that credit losses be reported using an expected losses model rather than the incurred losses model that is currently used. The standard also establishes additional disclosures related to credit risks. This standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022. The adoption of this guidance on January 1, 2023 did not have a material impact on the Company's Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and related disclosures. 
 In August 2020, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ASU 2020-06 Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging Contracts in Entity s Own Equity. Among other changes, ASU 2020-06 removes the liability and equity separation model for convertible instruments with a cash conversion feature, and as a result, after adoption, entities will no longer separately present in equity an embedded conversion feature for such debt. Similarly, the embedded conversion feature will no longer be amortized into income as interest expense over the life of the 
 70 

Table of Contents 

 instrument. Instead, entities will account for a convertible debt instrument wholly as debt unless (1) a convertible instrument contains features that require bifurcation as a derivative under ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, or (2) a convertible debt instrument was issued at a substantial premium. Additionally, ASU 2020-06 requires the application of the if-converted method to calculate the impact of convertible instruments on diluted earnings per share and updates the disclosure requirements in ASC 470-20, making them easier to understand for financial statement preparers and improving the decision-usefulness and relevance of the information for financial statement users. The Company early adopted the new guidance from January 1, 2023, noting no material impact. 
 In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures (Topic 280). The standard requires incremental disclosures related to reportable segments, including disaggregated expense information and the title and position of the company's chief operating decision maker ("CODM"), as identified for purposes of segment determination. The ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Entities must adopt the changes to the segment reporting guidance on a retrospective basis. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this standard on its consolidated financial statements. 
 In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, which focuses on income tax disclosures by requiring public business entities, on an annual basis, to disclose specific categories in the rate reconciliation, provide information for reconciling items that meet a quantitative threshold, and certain information about income taxes paid. The standard is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. The amendments should be applied on a prospective basis. Retrospective application is permitted. 
 Seasonality 
 There is a degree of seasonality in the growing cycles, procurement and transportation of crops. The farming industry in general historically experiences seasonal fluctuations in revenues and net income. Typically, the Company has lower sales and net income during the non-harvest seasons and higher sales and net income during the harvest season and as such, must have sufficient working capital to fund its operations at a reduced level. The failure to generate or obtain sufficient working capital during the winter may have a material adverse effect on the Company. 
 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors. 
 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 Not applicable. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined under Rule 13a-15 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), as of September 30, 2024. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that as of such date our disclosure controls and procedures are effective in recording, processing, summarizing and reporting, on a timely basis, information requested to be disclosed by us in our reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as that term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 PART II - OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 From time to time, we are a defendant or plaintiff in various legal actions that arise in the normal course of business. We record legal costs associated with loss contingencies as incurred and have accrued for all probable and estimable settlements. 
 
 On November 7, 2024, Lombard Trading International Corp. filed an Amended Complaint against the Company and Sadot Latam, LLC in the 11th Judicial Circuit of Florida in and for Miami-Dade County, Florida (Case No.: 2024-020971-CA-01). The Amended Complaint alleges unjust enrichment, conversion, fraud, conspiracy and civil theft related to a commodities transaction. The plaintiff claims that the Company failed to pay upon delivery of certain goods and is seeking damages in the amount of 7.4 million. The Company denies these allegations and intends to vigorously defend against the claims. While the Company believes it has meritorious defenses, it cannot predict the outcome of this matter or reasonably estimate the potential loss at this time 
 
 Item 1.A. Risk Factors 
 We are exposed to potential business disruption including, but not limited to, disruption of transportation services, disruption in the supply, and other impacts resulting from acts of terrorism or war, natural disasters, pandemics, severe weather conditions, accidents, or other planned disruptions, which could adversely affect our operating results. 
 Our operations rely on dependable and efficient transportation services the disruption of which could result in difficulties supplying materials to our facilities and impair our ability to deliver products to our customers in a timely manner. Certain factors which may impact the availability of agricultural commodity raw materials are out of our control including, but not 
 limited to, disruptions resulting from weather, high or low river water conditions, economic conditions, manufacturing delays or disruptions at suppliers, shortage of materials, interruption of energy supply and unavailable or poor supplier credit conditions. 
 Our Company s operating results could be affected by political instability and by changes in monetary, fiscal, trade, and environmental policies, laws, regulations, and acquisition approvals, creating risks including, but not limited to: changes in a country s or region s economic or political conditions, local labor conditions and regulations, and safety and environmental regulations; reduced protection of intellectual property rights; changes in the regulatory or legal environment; restrictions on currency exchange activities; currency exchange fluctuations; burdensome taxes and tariffs; enforceability of legal agreements and judgments; adverse tax, administrative agency or judicial outcomes; and regulation or taxation of greenhouse gases. International risks and uncertainties, including changing social and economic conditions as well as terrorism, political hostilities, and war, could limit our ability to transact business in these markets. Our Company benefits from the free flow of agricultural and food and feed ingredient products from the U.S. and other sources to markets around the world. Increases in tariff and restrictive trade activities around the world (e.g., the U.S.-China trade relations dispute, Iran sanctions) could negatively impact our ability to enter certain markets or the price of products may become less competitive in those markets. 
 Also, see Item 7 ("Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Factors that May Affect Future Results and Financial Condition") of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on March 20, 2024.
