financing to meet its obligations and repay its liabilities arising from normal business operations when they are due. While the Company
is attempting to continue operations and generate revenues, the Company s cash position may not be significant enough to support
the Company s daily operations. Management believes that the actions presently being taken to further implement the Company s
business plan; to expand sales with a dynamic marketing campaign and generate revenues provide the opportunity for the Company to continue
as a going concern. While the Company believes in the viability of its strategy to generate revenues and in its ability to raise
additional funds, there can be no assurances to that effect. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent

From time to time, we or our representatives have made or may make forward-looking
statements, orally or in writing. Such forward-looking statements may be included in, but not limited to, press releases, oral statements

 The financial information set forth in the following discussion should
be read in conjunction with the financial statements of Gold Rock Holdings, Inc. included elsewhere herein. 

Business 

Gold Rock Holdings, Inc., (Gold Rock) a Nevada corporation, is a holding
company that acquires technological assets. 

The Company changed its business model from engineering and construction
management services, produce site-plans, construction drawings, cost computations, fiber network designs, and other related construction
services, as a result of a change in control on October 2, 2023. 

Gold Rock intends to grow and further establish itself through mergers,
acquisitions, and management of technological assets. As such, Gold Rock Holdings, Inc. (the "Company") announced on December
12, 2023, that it formed a Wyoming corporation by the name of LOOT8, Inc. as its operating wholly-owned subsidiary. LOOT8, Inc. acquired
certain intellectual property known as "LOOT8." LOOT8 is a Web3 Commerce and Content Management Engine Software. At its
core, it harnesses the power of multiple public blockchains alongside the IPFS file system, with a user-friendly interface akin to Web2.
LOOT8 is engineered to cater to a variety of enterprise necessities including digital product passports, private communication channels,
and loyalty programs, among others. LOOT8 provides enterprises the capability to oversee and manage their content on IPFS nodes, leveraging
AI to make the underlying content interactive as a way to enable small businesses and content creators to scale at a faster pace and to
create differentiated experiences. 

LOOT8, Inc. currently in its infancy in marketing its Web3 online platform
phase of its business and has no revenue. However, it has developed a Web3 content management system (CMS) pioneering the Relationship
Economy through SocialFi, and a new monetization model. This model is designed to empower individuals with compelling stories to
monetize their relationships beyond traditional influencer models. 

The new monetization model is made up of three discrete revenue streams.
It is planned that the first stream will be a direct-to-consumer (D2C) model where LOOT8 will employ Web3 technology to manage collectibles
and fan engagements. Key initiatives include athletes', musicians', and influencers' Name, Image, and Likeness (NIL) rights, and revenue
generation through a 10 transaction fee on subscriptions and digital collectible sales. The model also includes a collaboration with
LBX Food Robotics for vending machines at universities and other venues, which serve as sales points for digital memorabilia, and the
integration of APPIX for real-time notifications on collectible availability. The second anticipated revenue stream targets the youth
market. LOOT8 plans to leverage high-profile athletes, musicians, and influencers to create personalized, customizable avatars. This feature
is expected to contribute to revenue through a 10 transaction fee on cosmetic items for AI companions, while maintaining these digital
assets on LOOT8 s platform. The third anticipated stream will utilize an enterprise model, leveraging Marcus Daley, GRHI's CEO's
background with NeuralMetrics, towards Software as a Service (SaaS) and Platform as a Service (PaaS) licensing models. The Company plans
to focus on Annual Contract Value (ACV) and Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) from corporate clients. This approach will allow the Company
to address enterprise needs in digital agent, persona and workflow solutions that accelerate existing business use-cases. For purposes
of authenticity and compliance, the offerings optionally leverage digital product passport type solutions that address regulations in
Europe and similar use-cases globally. The K-Project division of GRHI is an Artificial Intelligence (AI) operation that seeks to integrate
its AI technology applications across various industries. 

GRHI's management business plan is to fully deploy, market and and utilize
its LOOT8 platform, focusing on its K-Project AI and blockchain innovation in digital assets, the SocialFi revolution, and expanding into
direct-to-business relationships.

be paid in twelve (12) installments of 10,416.66 each. The agreement was a month-to-month agreement. LOOT8, Inc., its partner Perpetual
Sports, and the University of Houston's Basketball team were working together, building a social media Web3 technology on LOOT8's platform,
with a focus on creator-controlled content management and revenues associated with athletes' Name, Image, and Likeness (NIL). As of the
date of the filing, the agreement with Perpetual Sports, LLC has been cancelled and the Company is in direct discussion with the University
of Houston to seek a new agreement to continue the sponsorship (See Item 5 - Other Information; Subsequent Events).

Anthony Denkinger as its Chief Executive Officer. 

During the period ending June 30, 2024, GRHI started a new division, "The
K Project" division committed to finding new technological advancements in Artificial Intelligent (AI) applications. 

On July 2, 2024, LOOT8, Inc., the Company's wholly-owned subsidiary received
from Perpetual Sports. LLC the return of approximately 20,833 to the Company for payments made on the consulting agreement for April
and May 2024. The Company and Perpetual Sports mutually agreed to terminated month-to-month consultant agreement on July 18, 2024. The
Company's management is in direct negations with the University of Houston to continue its sponsorship agreement, but no definitive agreement

AI services to a client, but its LOOT8, Inc. wholly owned subsidiary's Web3 content management system had no revenues, and during the
same period in 2023 the Company from its previous business operations had no contracts for the laying of underground fiber and copper
cables 

Gross Profit for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 72,500 and
for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was -0-. 

Operating expenses for nine months ended September 30, 2024, totaled 310,690
from board of director compensation, consulting expense and general and administrative expenses, compared to 217,210 for the nine months
ended September 30, 2023. The increase during the same nine month period ended September 30, 2024 was attributed to higher board of director
compensation, consulting expense and general and administrative expense. 

Net Income/ Net Loss: 

Net Income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 20,405 and
the net loss for the three months ending September 30, 2023 was 10,554. Net loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023
were 238,190 and 217,210, respectively. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources: 

As of September 30, 2024, the Company s assets totaled 259,303 which
consisted of 215,303 in cash and 44,000 in accounts receivable. Our total liabilities were 81,585. As of September 30, 2024, the Company
had an accumulated deficit of 1,104,227 and has working capital of 177,718. 

As indicated herein, we need capital for the implementation of our business
plan, and we will need additional capital for continuing our operations. We do not have sufficient revenues to pay our operating
expenses at this time. Unless the Company is able to raise working capital, it is likely that the Company will either have to cease operations
or substantially change its methods of operations or change its business plan (See Note 4 in Financial Statements). 

Gold Rock Holdings, Inc. does not expect the adoption of recently issued
accounting pronouncements to have a significant impact on the Company, or any of its subsidiaries operating results, financial
position, or cash flow. 

Cash Provided by (Used in) Operating Activities 

Net cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended September
30, 2024 and 2023 were 210,505 and 10,035, respectively. 

- 14 - 

Cash Flows from Investing Activities 

Net cash used in investing activities was -0- for both the nine months
periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 

Cash Provided by Financing Activities 

Net cash provided by financing activities was 425,700 for nine months
ended September 30, 2024 from the cash proceeds received from sale of common stock and capital contributions from directors, and was 8,907
for nine months ended September 30, 2023 from the amount of capital contributions from the Company's directors. 

Critical Accounting Policies 

Our financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. Preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that impact the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. These estimates and assumptions are affected
by management s application of accounting policies. Critical accounting policies include revenue recognition and stock-based compensation.
The Company has implemented all new accounting pronouncements that are in effect and is evaluating any that may impact its financial statements,
including revenue recognition. The Company does not believe that there are any other new accounting pronouncements that have been issued
that might have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations. 

Revenue Recognition 

In accordance with ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers
("ASC 606"), revenues are recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our clients, in an amount
that reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for those goods and services. To achieve this core principle,
we apply the following five steps: (1) Identify the contract with a client; (2) Identify the performance obligations in the contract;
(3) Determine the transaction price; (4) Allocate the transaction price to performance obligations in the contract; and (5) Recognize
revenues when or as the company satisfies a performance obligation. 

We adopted this ASC on January 1, 2019. Although the new revenue standard
is expected to have an immaterial impact, if any, on our ongoing net income, we did implement changes to our processes related to revenue
recognition and the control activities within them. 

Stock-Based Compensation 

We account for employee and non-employee stock-based compensation in accordance
with the guidance of FASB ASC Topic 718, Compensation Stock Compensation, which requires all share-based payments,
including grants of stock options, to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values. The fair value of the
equity instrument is charged directly to compensation expense and credited to additional paid-in capital over the period during which
services are rendered. 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements 

The Company has implemented all new accounting pronouncements that are
in effect and is evaluating any that may impact its financial statements, including revenue recognition. The Company does not believe
that there are any other new accounting pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material impact on its financial position
or results of operations. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements. 

Going Concern 

We have incurred net losses since our inception. We anticipate incurring
additional losses before realizing growth in revenue and we will depend on additional financing in order to meet our continuing obligations
and ultimately to attain profitability. Our ability to obtain additional financing, whether through the issuance of additional equity
or through the assumption of debt, is uncertain. These conditions raise substantial doubt as to the Company's ability to continue as a
going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the uncertainty about our ability to
continue our business. 

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 

Not applicable 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Our management, with the participation of our Principal Executive Officer
and Principal Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934 Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. In designing and
evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed
and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure
controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and that management is required to apply its judgment
in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs. 

Based on our evaluation, our Principal Executive Officer and Principal
Financial Officer, after considering the existence of material weaknesses identified, determined that our internal control over financial
reporting disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2024. 

- 15 - 

Evaluation of Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate
internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Our
internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 

Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and
procedures that: (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
dispositions of our assets, (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in
accordance with the authorization of our management and directors, and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements. 

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting
may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk
that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures
may deteriorate. 

Management, including our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial
Officer, assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2024. In making this assessment,
management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ("COSO") in Internal
Control Integrated Framework (2013). 

We identified the following deficiencies which together constitute a material
weakness in our assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2024: 

- The Company has inadequate segregation of duties within its
cash disbursement control design. 

- During the period ended September 30, 2024, the Company internally
performed all aspects of its financial reporting process, including, but not limited to the underlying accounting records and the recording
of journal entries and for the preparation of financial statements. This process was deficient, because these duties were performed often
times by the same people, and therefore a lack of review was created over the financial reporting process that might result in a failure
to detect errors in spreadsheets, calculations, or assumptions used to compile the financial statements and related disclosures as filed
with the SEC. These control deficiencies could result in a material misstatement to our interim or annual financial statements that would
not be prevented or detected. 

It should be noted that any system of controls, however well designed and
operated, can provide only reasonable, and not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the system are met. In addition, the design
of any control system is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events. Because of these and other inherent
limitations of control system, there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential
future conditions. 

This report does not include an attestation report of the Company's registered
public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management's report was not subject to attestation by the
Company's registered public accounting firm pursuant to rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit us to provide only
management's report in this annual report. 

We regularly review our system of internal control over financial reporting
to ensure that we maintain an effective internal control environment. If deficiencies appear in our internal controls, management will
make changes that address those deficiencies. 

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

There have been no changes in the Company's internal control over financial
reporting that occurred during the reporting period ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to
materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting. 

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION
