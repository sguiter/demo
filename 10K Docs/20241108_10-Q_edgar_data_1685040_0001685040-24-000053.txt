 The accrued interest receivable on fixed maturity securities totaled million and million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, and is included in accrued investment income. 
 Current Period Evaluation 
 Based on the Company s current evaluation of its fixed maturity securities in an unrealized loss position and the current intent or requirement to sell, the Company recorded an allowance for credit losses of million, relating to securities, at September 30, 2024. Management concluded that for all other fixed maturity securities in an unrealized loss position, the unrealized loss was not due to issuer-specific credit-related factors and as a result was recognized in OCI. Where unrealized losses have not been recognized into income, it is primarily because the securities bond issuer(s) are of high credit quality, management does not intend to sell and it is likely that management will not be required to sell the securities prior to their anticipated recovery, and the decline in estimated fair value is largely due to changes in interest rates and non-issuer specific credit spreads. These issuers continued to make timely principal and interest payments and the estimated fair value is expected to recover as the securities approach maturity.

 The loan-to-value ratio is a measure commonly used to assess the quality of commercial and agricultural mortgage loans. The loan-to-value ratio compares the amount of the loan to the estimated fair value of the underlying property collateralizing the loan and is commonly expressed as a percentage. A loan-to-value ratio less than 100 indicates an excess of collateral value over the loan amount. Loan-to-value ratios greater than 100 indicate that the loan amount exceeds the collateral value. Performing status is a measure commonly used to assess the quality of residential mortgage loans. A loan is considered performing when the borrower makes consistent and timely payments. 
 1.00x - 1.20x Less than 1.00x Total 
 The debt-service coverage ratio compares a property s net operating income to its debt-service payments. Debt-service coverage ratios less than 1.00 times indicate that property operations do not generate enough income to cover the loan s current debt payments. A debt-service coverage ratio greater than 1.00 times indicates an excess of net operating income over the debt-service payments.

 (1) The related loaned security could be returned to the Company on the next business day which would require the Company to immediately return the cash collateral. 
 If the Company is required to return significant amounts of cash collateral on short notice and is forced to sell securities to meet the return obligation, it may have difficulty selling such collateral that is invested in securities in a timely manner, be forced to sell securities in a volatile or illiquid market for less than what otherwise would have been realized in normal market conditions, or both. The estimated fair value of the securities on loan related to the cash collateral on open at September 30, 2024 was million, primarily comprised of U.S. government and agency securities which, if put back to the Company, could be immediately sold to satisfy the cash requirement. 
 The reinvestment portfolio acquired with the cash collateral consisted principally of fixed maturity securities (including agency RMBS, ABS, U.S. and foreign corporate securities, U.S. government and agency securities, non-agency RMBS and CMBS) with invested in agency RMBS, U.S. government and agency securities and cash and cash equivalents at September 30, 2024. If the securities on loan or the reinvestment portfolio become less liquid, the Company has the liquidity resources of most of its general account available to meet any potential cash demands when securities on loan are put back to the Company.

 Fixed Maturity Securities 
 The Company invests in U.S. corporate bonds, foreign corporate bonds and Structured Securities issued by VIEs. The Company is not obligated to provide any financial or other support to these VIEs, other than the original investment. The Company s involvement with these entities is limited to that of a passive investor. The Company has no unilateral right to appoint or remove the servicer, special servicer, or investment manager, which are generally viewed as having the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the VIE, nor does the Company function in any of these roles. The Company does not have the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the entity; as a result, the Company has determined it is not the primary beneficiary, or consolidator, of the VIE. The Company s maximum exposure to loss on these fixed maturity securities is limited to the amortized cost of these investments. See Fixed Maturity Securities Available-For-Sale for information on these securities.

For detailed information on these contracts and the related strategies, see Note 7 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in the 2023 Annual Report. In the third quarter of 2024, the Company began utilizing equity futures as non-qualified hedges to manage risk related to certain of its index-linked annuity products. In the second quarter of 2024, the Company began utilizing interest rate futures as non-qualified hedges to manage risk related to policyholder liabilities for institutional group annuities. In the first quarter of 2024, the Company entered into interest rate swaps that qualify for hedge accounting to manage the interest rate risk in certain of its funding agreement liabilities.

The Company s use of derivatives includes (i) derivatives that serve as hedges of the Company s exposure to various risks and generally do not qualify for hedge accounting because they do not meet the criteria required under portfolio hedging rules; (ii) derivatives that economically hedge insurance liabilities and generally do not qualify for hedge accounting because they do not meet the criteria of being highly effective as outlined in Accounting Standards Codification 815 Derivatives and Hedging; (iii) derivatives that economically hedge MRBs that do not qualify for hedge accounting because the changes in estimated fair value of the MRBs are already recorded in net income; and (iv) written credit default swaps that are used to create synthetic credit investments and that do not qualify for hedge accounting because they do not involve a hedging relationship.

 (1) The Company has written credit protection on both single name and index references. The rating agency designations are based on availability and the midpoint of the applicable ratings among Moody s, S P and Fitch. If no rating is available from a rating agency, then an internally developed rating is used. 
 (2) The weighted average years to maturity of the credit default swaps is calculated based on weighted average gross notional amounts. 
 
 The Company may be exposed to credit-related losses in the event of counterparty nonperformance on derivative instruments. 
 The Company manages its credit risk by: (i) entering into derivative transactions with creditworthy counterparties governed by master netting agreements; (ii) trading through regulated exchanges and central clearing counterparties; (iii) obtaining collateral, such as cash and securities, when appropriate; and (iv) setting limits on single party credit exposures which are subject to periodic management review. 
 See Note 9 for a description of the impact of credit risk on the valuation of derivatives.

 (1) Represents amounts subject to an enforceable master netting agreement or similar agreement. 
 (2) The amount of cash collateral offset in the table above is limited to the net estimated fair value of derivatives after application of netting agreement. 
 (3) Securities collateral received from counterparties is not reported on the consolidated balance sheets and may not be sold or re-pledged unless the counterparty is in default. Amounts do not include excess of collateral pledged or received. 
 The Company s collateral arrangements generally require the counterparty in a net liability position, after considering the effect of netting agreements, to pledge collateral when the amount owed by that counterparty reaches a minimum transfer amount. Certain of these arrangements also include credit-contingent provisions which permit the party with positive fair value to terminate the derivative at the current fair value or demand immediate full collateralization from the party in a net liability position, in the event that the financial strength or credit rating of the party in a net liability position falls below a certain level.

As a result, if the credit-contingent provisions of derivative contracts in a net liability position were triggered, minimal additional assets would be required to be posted as collateral or needed to settle the instruments immediately. Additionally, the Company is required to pledge initial margin for certain new over-the-counter OTC bilateral contracts between two counterparties OTC-bilateral derivative transactions to third-party custodians.

 _______________ 
 (1) Mortality rates vary by age and by demographic characteristics such as gender. The range shown reflects the mortality rate for policyholders between 35 and 90 years old. Mortality rate assumptions are set based on company experience and include an assumption for mortality improvement. 
 (2) The lapse rate range reflects base lapse rates for major product categories for duration 1-20. Base lapse rates are adjusted at the contract level based on a comparison of the actuarially calculated guaranteed values and the current policyholder account value, as well as other factors, such as the applicability of any surrender charges. For variable annuity guarantees, a dynamic lapse function reduces the base lapse rate when the guaranteed amount is greater than the account value as in-the-money contracts are less likely to lapse. Lapse rates are also generally assumed to be lower in periods when a surrender charge applies. 
 (3) The utilization rate assumption for variable annuity guarantees estimates the percentage of contract holders with a guaranteed minimum income benefit GMIB or lifetime withdrawal benefit who will elect to utilize the benefit upon becoming eligible in a given year. The range shown represents the floor and cap of the GMIB dynamic election rates across varying levels of in-the-money. For lifetime withdrawal guarantee riders, the assumption is that everyone will begin withdrawals once account value reaches zero which is equivalent to a 100 utilization rate. Utilization rates may vary by the type of guarantee, the amount by which the guaranteed amount is greater than the account value, the contract s withdrawal history and by the age of the policyholder.

 9. Fair Value (continued) 

 The Company does not develop unobservable inputs used in measuring fair value for all other assets and liabilities classified within Level 3; therefore, these are not included in the table above. The other Level 3 assets and liabilities primarily included fixed maturity securities and derivatives. For fixed maturity securities valued based on non-binding broker quotes, an increase (decrease) in credit spreads would result in a (lower) higher fair value. For derivatives valued based on third-party pricing models, an increase (decrease) in credit spreads would generally result in a (lower) higher fair value.

 Matters as to Which an Estimate Cannot Be Made 
 For other matters, the Company is not currently able to estimate the reasonably possible loss or range of loss. The Company is often unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss until developments in such matters have provided sufficient information to support an assessment of the range of possible loss, such as quantification of a damage demand from plaintiffs, discovery from other parties and investigation of factual allegations, rulings by the court on motions or appeals, analysis by experts, and the progress of settlement negotiations. On a quarterly and annual basis, the Company reviews relevant information with respect to litigation contingencies and updates its accruals, disclosures and estimates of reasonably possible losses or ranges of loss based on such reviews. 
 Sales Practices Claims 
 Over the past several years, the Company has faced claims and regulatory inquiries and investigations, alleging improper marketing or sales of individual life insurance policies, annuities or other products. The Company continues to defend vigorously against the claims in these matters. The Company believes adequate provision has been made in its consolidated financial statements for all probable and reasonably estimable losses for sales practices matters. 
 Cost of Insurance Class Actions 
 Richard A. Newton v. Brighthouse Life Insurance Company (U.S. District Court, Northern District of Georgia, Atlanta Division, filed May 8, 2020). Plaintiff has filed a purported class action lawsuit against Brighthouse Life Insurance Company, a subsidiary of Brighthouse Financial, Inc. Plaintiff was the owner of a universal life insurance policy issued by Travelers Insurance Company, a predecessor to Brighthouse Life Insurance Company. Plaintiff seeks to certify a class of all persons who own or owned life insurance policies issued where the terms of the life insurance policy provide or provided, among other things, a guarantee that the cost of insurance rates would not be increased by more than a specified percentage in any contract year. Plaintiff also alleges that cost of insurance charges were based on improper factors and should have decreased over time due to improving mortality but did not . Plaintiff alleges, among other things, causes of action for breach of contract, fraud, suppression and concealment, and violation of the Georgia Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act. Plaintiff seeks to recover damages, including punitive damages, interest and treble damages, attorneys fees, and injunctive and declaratory relief. Brighthouse Life Insurance Company filed a motion to dismiss in June 2020, which was granted in part and denied in part in March 2021. Plaintiff was granted leave to amend the complaint. On January 18, 2023, Plaintiff filed a motion on consent to amend the second amended class action complaint to narrow the scope of the class sought to those who own or owned policies issued in Georgia; the motion was granted on January 23, 2023, and the third amended class action complaint was filed on January 23, 2023. The Company intends to vigorously defend this matter.

For certain other matters, the Company may not currently be able to estimate the reasonably possible loss or estimated range of loss until developments in such matters have provided sufficient information to support an assessment of such loss. During the first quarter of 2024, an arbitration panel ruled in favor of a reinsurer seeking a premium rate increase retroactive to September 2019 resulting in a million loss, of which million was reported in universal life and investment product-type policy fees and million was reported in other expenses.

 Commitments to Fund Partnership Investments, Bank Credit Facilities and Private Corporate Bond Investments

 million, while in other cases such limitations are not specified or applicable. Since certain of these obligations are not subject to limitations, the Company does not believe that it is possible to determine the maximum potential amount that could become due under these guarantees in the future. Management believes that it is unlikely the Company will have to make any material payments under these indemnities, guarantees, or commitments. 
 In addition, the Company indemnifies its directors and officers as provided in its charters and bylaws. Also, the Company indemnifies its agents for liabilities incurred as a result of their representation of the Company s interests. Since these indemnities are generally not subject to limitation with respect to duration or amount, the Company does not believe that it is possible to determine the maximum potential amount that could become due under these indemnities in the future.

 Net income (loss) available to shareholders and adjusted earnings, a non-GAAP financial measure, were as follows:

 __________________ 
 (1) We use the term net income (loss) available to shareholders to refer to net income (loss) available to Brighthouse Financial, Inc. s common shareholders and adjusted loss to refer to negative adjusted earnings values throughout the results of operations discussions. 
 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we had net income available to shareholders of 150 million and adjusted earnings of 767 million compared to net income available to shareholders of 453 million and adjusted earnings of 326 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Net income available to shareholders for the three months ended September 30, 2024 primarily reflects favorable pre-tax adjusted earnings and a favorable change in the estimated fair value of freestanding interest rate derivatives we use to hedge our universal life with secondary guarantees ULSG business resulting from decreasing long-term interest rates. The favorable impacts were partially offset by net unfavorable changes in the estimated fair value of our variable annuity guaranteed benefit riders due to market factors, net investment losses on sales of fixed maturity securities and net investment losses on mortgage loans. 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we had net loss available to shareholders of 360 million and adjusted earnings of 1.0 billion compared to net loss available to shareholders of 272 million and adjusted earnings of 792 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Net loss available to shareholders for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily reflects net unfavorable changes in the estimated fair value of our variable annuity guaranteed benefit riders due to market factors, net investment losses on sales of fixed maturity securities, net investment losses on mortgage loans and an unfavorable change in the estimated fair value of freestanding interest rate derivatives we use to hedge our ULSG business resulting from increasing long-term interest rates. These unfavorable impacts were partially offset by favorable pre-tax adjusted earnings, net of an unfavorable impact due to a reinsurance premium rate increase retroactive to September 2019, which resulted from the conclusion of a reinsurance arbitration, and the related impacts. 
 See Non-GAAP Financial Disclosures. See Results of Operations for a detailed discussion of our results. 
 
 Industry Trends and Uncertainties 
 Throughout this Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, we discuss a number of trends and uncertainties that we believe may materially affect our future financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Where these trends or uncertainties are specific to a particular aspect of our business, we often include such a discussion under the relevant caption of this Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, as part of our broader analysis of that area of our business. Refer to Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Industry Trends and Uncertainties included in our 2023 Annual Report, as amended or supplemented by our subsequent Quarterly Reports and herein, for a comprehensive discussion of some of the key general trends and uncertainties that have influenced the development of our business and our historical financial performance and that we believe will continue to influence our business and results of operations in the future.

 Financial and Economic Environment 
 Our business and results of operations are materially affected by conditions in the capital markets and the economy generally. Stressed conditions, volatility and disruptions in the capital markets or financial asset classes can have an adverse effect on us. Equity market performance can affect our profitability for variable annuities and other separate account products as a result of the effects it has on product demand, revenues, expenses, reserves and our risk management effectiveness. The level of long-term interest rates and the shape of the yield curve can have a negative effect on the profitability for variable annuities, as well as the demand for, and the profitability of, spread-based products such as fixed annuities, index-linked annuities and universal life insurance. Low interest rates and risk premium, including credit spread, affect new money rates on invested assets and the cost of product guarantees. Insurance premium growth and demand for our products is impacted by the general health of U.S. economic activity. A sustained or material increase in inflation could also affect our business in several ways. During inflationary periods, the value of fixed income investments falls which could increase realized and unrealized losses. The Federal Reserve Board (the Federal Reserve decreased the target range for the federal funds rate in September and November 2024, and may decrease the target range again, which may negatively impact our business in certain respects, including our investment portfolio, by lowering the level of long-term interest rates and changing the shape of the yield curve. Inflation also increases our expenses (including, among others, for labor and third-party services), potentially putting pressure on profitability if such costs cannot be passed through to policyholders in our product prices. Prolonged and elevated inflation could adversely affect the financial markets and the economy generally and dispelling it may require governments to pursue restrictive fiscal and monetary policies, which could constrain overall economic activity and inhibit revenue growth. Events involving limited liquidity, defaults, nonperformance or other adverse developments that affect financial institutions or the financial services industry generally, or concerns or rumors about events of these kinds or other similar risks, could adversely affect market-wide liquidity, which could increase the risk of a recession or an equity market downturn and negatively impact various portions of our business, including our investment portfolio. See Risk Factors Economic Environment and Capital Markets-Related Risks If difficult conditions in the capital markets and the U.S. economy generally persist or are perceived to persist, they may materially adversely affect our business and results of operations and Risk Factors Risks Related to our Investment Portfolio Our investment portfolio is subject to significant financial risks both in the U.S. and global financial markets, including credit risk, interest rate risk, inflation risk, market valuation risk, liquidity risk, real estate risk, derivatives risk, and other factors outside our control, the occurrence of any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations included in our 2023 Annual Report. 
 We continue to closely monitor political and economic conditions that might contribute to market volatility and their impact on our business operations, investment portfolio and derivatives, such as global inflation, uncertainty and instability in certain asset classes (including commercial real estate), supply chain disruptions and recent geopolitical conflicts, including in Europe and the Middle East.

 Regulatory Developments 
 Our insurance subsidiaries and Brighthouse Reinsurance Company of Delaware BRCD are primarily regulated at the state level, with some products and services also subject to federal regulation. In addition, BHF and its insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulation under the insurance holding company laws of various U.S. jurisdictions. Furthermore, some of our operations, products and services are subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, consumer protection laws, securities, broker-dealer and investment advisor regulations, as well as environmental and unclaimed property laws and regulations.

 Summary of Critical Accounting Estimates 
 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to adopt accounting policies and make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported on the Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 The most critical estimates include those used in determining: 
 liability for future policy benefits; 
 estimated fair values of market risk benefits MRB 
 estimated fair values of freestanding derivatives and the recognition and estimated fair value of embedded derivatives requiring bifurcation; and 
 measurement of income taxes and the valuation of deferred tax assets. 
 In applying our accounting policies, we make subjective and complex judgments that frequently require estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain. Many of these policies, estimates and related judgments are common in the insurance and financial services industries; others are specific to our business and operations. Actual results could differ from these estimates. 
 The above critical accounting estimates are described in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Summary of Critical Accounting Estimates and Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in our 2023 Annual Report. 
 
 Non-GAAP Financial Disclosures 
 We present certain measures of our performance that are not calculated in accordance with GAAP. Our definitions of non-GAAP financial measures may differ from those used by other companies. 
 Adjusted Earnings 
 Adjusted earnings is a financial measure used by management to evaluate performance and facilitate comparisons to industry results. We believe the presentation of adjusted earnings, as the Company measures it for management purposes, enhances the understanding of our performance by the investor community by highlighting the results of operations and the underlying profitability drivers of our business. Adjusted earnings should not be viewed as a substitute for net income (loss) available to Brighthouse Financial, Inc. s common shareholders, which is the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP. See Results of Operations for a reconciliation of adjusted earnings to net income (loss) available to Brighthouse Financial, Inc. s common shareholders. 
 Adjusted earnings, which may be positive or negative, focuses on our primary businesses by excluding the impact of market volatility, which could distort trends. The Company uses the term adjusted loss throughout this report to refer to negative adjusted earnings values. 
 The following are significant items excluded from total revenues in calculating adjusted earnings: 
 Net investment gains (losses); and 
 Net derivative gains (losses), excluding earned income and amortization of premium on derivatives that are hedges of investments or that are used to replicate certain investments, but do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment Investment Hedge Adjustments ). 
 The following are significant items excluded from total expenses in calculating adjusted earnings: 
 Change in MRBs; and 
 Change in fair value of the crediting rate on experience-rated contracts Market Value Adjustments ). 
 The provision for income tax related to adjusted earnings is calculated using the statutory tax rate of 21 , net of impacts related to the dividends received deduction, tax credits and current period non-recurring items.

 We present adjusted earnings in a manner consistent with management s view of the primary business activities that drive the profitability of our core businesses. The following table illustrates how each component of adjusted earnings is calculated from the GAAP statements of operations line items: 
 Component of Adjusted Earnings How Derived from GAAP (1) (i) Fee income (i) Universal life and investment-type product policy fees plus Other revenues . 
 (ii) Net investment spread (ii) Net investment income plus Investment Hedge Adjustments reduced by Interest credited to policyholder account balances (excluding Market Value Adjustments) and interest on future policy benefits. 
 (iii) Insurance-related activities (iii) Premiums less Policyholder benefits and claims , excluding interest on future policy benefits. 
 (iv) Amortization of DAC and VOBA (iv) Amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs DAC and value of business acquired VOBA . 
 (v) Other expenses 
 (v) Other expenses. 
 (vi) Provision for income tax expense (benefit) (vi) Tax impact of the above items, calculated using the statutory tax rate of 21 , net of impacts related to the dividends received deduction, tax credits and current period non-recurring items. 
 
 __________________ 
 (1) Italicized items indicate GAAP statements of operations line items. 
 Consistent with GAAP guidance for segment reporting, adjusted earnings is also our GAAP measure of segment performance. Accordingly, we report adjusted earnings by segment in Note 2 of the Notes to the Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 Adjusted Net Investment Income 
 Adjusted net investment income is used by management to measure our performance, and we believe it enhances the understanding of our investment portfolio results. Adjusted net investment income represents GAAP net investment income plus Investment Hedge Adjustments. For a reconciliation of adjusted net investment income to net investment income, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, see table note (3) to the summary yield table located in Investments Current Environment Investment Portfolio Results. 
 Adjusted Net Investment Income Yield 
 Similar to adjusted net investment income, adjusted net investment income yield is used by management as a performance measure that we believe enhances the understanding of our investment portfolio results. Adjusted net investment income yield represents adjusted net investment income as a percentage of average quarterly asset carrying values. Asset carrying values exclude unrealized gains (losses), collateral received in connection with our securities lending program, freestanding derivative assets and collateral received from derivative counterparties. Investment fee and expense yields are calculated as a percentage of average quarterly asset estimated fair values. Asset estimated fair values exclude collateral received in connection with our securities lending program, freestanding derivative assets and collateral received from derivative counterparties. For a reconciliation of adjusted net investment income yield to net investment income, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, see the summary yield table located in Investments Current Environment Investment Portfolio Results.

 Annual Actuarial Review 
 We typically conduct our annual actuarial review AAR in the third quarter of each year. As part of the 2024 AAR, for our ULSG business, we increased the long-term general account earned rate, driven by an increase in the mean reversion rate, from 3.75 to 4.00 . Also, with respect to our ULSG business, we updated assumptions regarding policyholder behavior, including mortality, premium persistency, lapses and withdrawals. For our variable annuity business, we updated our annuitization, mortality, lapses and withdrawals, as well as separate account assumptions, including fund fees and allocations. For term participating and non-participating whole life insurance, we updated assumptions regarding mortality and lapses. 
 As part of the 2023 AAR, for our ULSG business, we increased the long-term general account earned rate, driven by an increase in the mean reversion rate, from 3.50 to 3.75 . Also, with respect to our ULSG business, we updated assumptions regarding policyholder behavior, including mortality, premium persistency, lapses, withdrawals and maintenance expenses. For our variable annuity business, we updated our annuitization, mortality, lapses and withdrawals, as well as separate account assumptions, including fund fees, allocations and volatility. For term participating and non-participating whole life insurance, we updated assumptions regarding mortality and lapses.

 The decrease in income before provision for income tax was driven by the following unfavorable items: 
 losses from variable annuity guaranteed benefit riders, see Annuity Guaranteed Benefits and Shield Annuity Liabilities for the Three Months and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 and 
 the net impact of embedded derivatives and equity options we use to hedge our non-variable annuity business, as equity markets increased in the current period, resulting in a loss of 26 million, and decreased in the prior period, resulting in a gain of 71 million. 
 The decrease in income before provision for income taxes was partially offset by the following favorable items: 
 the impact of long-term interest rates on interest rate derivatives used to manage interest rate exposure in our ULSG business, as the long-term interest rate decreased in the current period, resulting in a gain of 113 million, and increased in the prior period, resulting in a loss of 500 million; and 
 higher pre-tax adjusted earnings, as discussed in greater detail below. 
 The provision for income tax, expressed as a percentage of income (loss) before provision for income tax, resulted in an effective tax rate of 5 in the current period compared to 18 in the prior period.

 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared with the Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 Adjusted earnings were 767 million in the current period, an increase of 441 million. 
 Key net favorable impacts were: 
 lower net costs associated with insurance-related activities due to: 
 a net decrease in liability balances resulting from year-over-year changes made in connection with the AAR in our Run-off and Annuities segments and other refinements; and 
 an increase in income annuity underwriting margins; 
 partially offset by 
 higher paid claims, net of reinsurance; and 
 higher net fee income due to: 
 higher asset-based fees resulting from higher average separate account balances, a portion of which is offset in other expenses; and 
 higher reinsurance fees on our fixed annuity business resulting from higher account balances; 
 partially offset by 
 a decline in the net cost of insurance fees driven by the aging in-force business in our Run-off segment. 
 Key net unfavorable impacts were: 
 lower net investment spread due to: 
 higher interest credited to policyholders due to higher account balances and prior period actuarial modeling improvements, net of changes made in the current period in connection with the AAR in our Annuities segment; 
 partially offset by 
 higher average invested assets resulting from positive net flows in the general account; and 
 higher investment yields on our fixed income portfolio, as proceeds from maturing investments and the growth in the investment portfolio were invested at higher yields than the portfolio average; and

 partially offset by 
 an increase in liability balances in our Run-off segment resulting from a reinsurance premium rate increase associated with the conclusion of a reinsurance arbitration; and 
 a decrease in income annuity underwriting margins; and 
 higher net investment spread due to: 
 higher average invested assets resulting from positive net flows in the general account; 
 higher investment yields on our fixed income portfolio, as proceeds from maturing investments and the growth in the investment portfolio were invested at higher yields than the portfolio average; and 
 higher returns on other limited partnerships; 
 partially offset by 
 higher interest credited to policyholders due to higher account balances and prior period actuarial modeling improvements, net of changes made in the current period in connection with the AAR in our Annuities segment.

 Investments 
 
 Investment Risk Management Strategy 
 We manage the risks related to our investment portfolio through asset-type allocation as well as industry and issuer diversification. We also use risk limits to promote diversification by asset sector, avoid concentrations in any single issuer and limit overall aggregate credit and equity risk exposure. We manage real estate risk through geographic, property type and product type diversification and asset allocation. Interest rate risk is managed as part of our Asset Liability Management ALM strategies. We also utilize product design to manage interest rate risk (e.g., market value adjustment features and surrender charges). These ALM strategies include maintaining an investment portfolio that targets a weighted average duration that reflects the duration of our estimated liability cash flow profile. For certain of our liability portfolios, it is not possible to invest assets for the full liability duration, thereby creating some asset/liability mismatch. We also use certain derivatives in the management of credit, interest rate, equity market and foreign currency exchange rate risks. 
 Investment Management Agreements 
 Other than our derivatives trading, which we manage in-house, we have engaged a select group of experienced external asset management firms to manage the investment of the assets comprising our general account portfolio and certain separate account assets of our insurance subsidiaries, as well as assets of BHF and our reinsurance subsidiary, BRCD. 
 
 Current Environment 
 Our business and results of operations are materially affected by conditions in capital markets and the economy, generally. As a U.S. insurance company, we are affected by the monetary policy of the Federal Reserve in the U.S. The Federal Reserve may increase or decrease the federal funds rate in the future, which may have an impact on the pricing levels of risk-bearing investments and may adversely impact the level of product sales. We are also affected by the monetary policy of central banks around the world due to the diversification of our investment portfolio. See Industry Trends and Uncertainties Financial and Economic Environment. 
 On September 18, 2024, the Federal Reserve decreased the target range for the federal funds rate from between 5.25 and 5.50 to between 4.75 and 5.00 . On November 7, 2024, the Federal Reserve further decreased the target range for the federal funds rate from between 4.75 and 5.00 to between 4.50 and 4.75 . In 2023, the Federal Reserve increased the target range four times from between 4.25 and 4.50 to between 5.25 and 5.50 . Target range increases have contributed to the net unrealized loss position in our investment portfolio. As a result of increases in interest rates, the unrealized losses on our fixed maturity securities exceeded the unrealized gains as of September 30, 2024. 
 See Risk Factors Risks Related to Our Investment Portfolio Our investment portfolio is subject to significant financial risks both in the U.S. and global financial markets, including credit risk, interest rate risk, inflation risk, market valuation risk, liquidity risk, real estate risk, derivatives risk, and other factors outside our control, the occurrence of any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations included in our 2023 Annual Report. 
 
 Selected Sector Investments 
 Market volatility has affected the performance of various asset classes. See Risk Factors Risks Related to Our Investment Portfolio Our investment portfolio is subject to significant financial risks both in the U.S. and global financial markets, including credit risk, interest rate risk, inflation risk, market valuation risk, liquidity risk, real estate risk, derivatives risk, and other factors outside our control, the occurrence of any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations, and Risk Factors Risks Related to Our Investment Portfolio Ongoing military actions, the continued threat of terrorism, climate change as well as other catastrophic events may adversely affect the value of our investment portfolio and the level of claim losses we incur included in our 2023 Annual Report.

 There has been an increased market focus on commercial real estate, including office properties, as a result of companies shifting to hybrid work arrangements and the resulting impact on the demand for office space. 
 We have direct commercial real estate exposure through mortgage loans and certain structured securities, which include residential mortgage-backed securities RMBS ), commercial mortgage-backed securities CMBS and asset-backed securities ABS (collectively, Structured Securities ). In addition, we have direct and indirect exposure through certain financial industry corporate fixed maturity securities. See Investments Mortgage Loans and Note 7 of the Notes to the Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for information on mortgage loans, including credit quality by portfolio segment and commercial mortgage loans by property type. Additionally, see Investments Fixed Maturity Securities Available-For-Sale Structured Securities for information on Structured Securities, including security type, risk profile and ratings profile as well as Investments Fixed Maturity Securities Available-For-Sale U.S. and Foreign Corporate Fixed Maturity Securities for our exposure to the finance industry. 
 We monitor direct and indirect investment exposure across sectors and asset classes and adjust our level of investment exposure, as appropriate. At this time, we do not expect that our general account investments in these sectors and asset classes will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.

 _______________ 
 (1) During the year ended December 31, 2023, Fitch Ratings downgraded the U.S. credit rating from Aaa to Aa1, which resulted in a decrease in Aaa assets in our RMBS holdings. 
 Historically, our exposure to sub-prime RMBS holdings has been managed by focusing primarily on senior tranche securities, stress-testing the portfolio with severe loss assumptions and closely monitoring the performance of the portfolio. Our sub-prime RMBS portfolio consists predominantly of securities that were purchased after 2012 at significant discounts to par value and discounts to the expected principal recovery value of these securities. The vast majority of these securities are investment grade under the NAIC designations (e.g., NAIC 1 and NAIC 2).

 Securities Lending 
 We participate in a securities lending program whereby securities are loaned to third parties, primarily brokerage firms and commercial banks. We obtain collateral, usually cash, in an amount generally equal to 102 of the estimated fair value of the securities loaned, which is obtained at the inception of a loan and maintained at a level greater than or equal to 100 for the duration of the loan. The estimated fair value of the securities loaned is monitored on a daily basis with additional collateral obtained as necessary throughout the duration of the loan. Securities loaned under such transactions may be sold or re-pledged by the transferee. We are liable to return to our counterparties the cash collateral under our control. Security collateral received from counterparties may not be sold or re-pledged, unless the counterparty is in default, and is not reflected in the financial statements. These transactions are treated as financing arrangements and the associated cash collateral liability is recorded at the amount of the cash received. 
 See Liquidity and Capital Resources The Company Primary Uses of Liquidity and Capital Securities Lending and Note 7 of the Notes to the Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding our securities lending program. 
 
 Mortgage Loans 
 Our mortgage loans are principally collateralized by commercial, agricultural and residential properties. Information regarding mortgage loans by portfolio segment is summarized as follows at:

 Our mortgage loan portfolio is diversified by both geographic region and property type to reduce the risk of concentration. The percentage of our commercial and agricultural mortgage loan portfolios collateralized by properties located in the U.S. were 98 at both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The remainder was collateralized by properties located outside of the U.S. At September 30, 2024, the carrying value as a percentage of total commercial and agricultural mortgage loans for the top three states in the U.S. was 17 for California, 11 for Texas and 8 for Florida. Additionally, we manage risk when originating commercial and agricultural mortgage loans by generally lending up to 75 of the estimated fair value of the underlying real estate collateral. 
 Our residential mortgage loan portfolio is managed in a similar manner to reduce risk of concentration. All residential mortgage loans were collateralized by properties located in the U.S. at both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. At September 30, 2024, the carrying value as a percentage of total residential mortgage loans for the top three states in the U.S. was 40 for California, 10 for Florida and 6 for New York.

 Mortgage Loan Credit Quality Monitoring Process. Our mortgage loan investments are monitored on an ongoing basis, including a review of loans that are current, past due, restructured and under foreclosure. Quarterly, we conduct a formal review of the portfolio with our investment managers. See Note 7 of the Notes to the Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for information on mortgage loans by credit quality indicator, past due status, nonaccrual status and modified mortgage loans. 
 Our commercial mortgage loans are reviewed on an ongoing basis. These reviews may include an analysis of the property financial statements and rent roll, lease rollover analysis, property inspections, market analysis, estimated valuations of the underlying collateral, loan-to-value ratios, debt-service coverage ratios and tenant creditworthiness. The monitoring process focuses on higher risk loans, which include those that are classified as restructured, delinquent or in foreclosure, as well as loans with higher loan-to-value ratios and lower debt-service coverage ratios. The monitoring process for agricultural mortgage loans is generally similar, with a focus on higher risk loans, such as loans with higher loan-to-value ratios, including reviews on a geographic and sector basis. Our residential mortgage loans are reviewed on an ongoing basis. See Note 7 of the Notes to the Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for information on our evaluation of residential mortgage loans and related measurement of allowance for credit losses.

 Loan-to-value ratios and debt-service coverage ratios are common measures in the assessment of the quality of commercial mortgage loans. Loan-to-value ratios are a common measure in the assessment of the quality of agricultural mortgage loans. Loan-to-value ratios compare the amount of the loan to the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral. A loan-to-value ratio greater than 100 indicates that the loan amount is greater than the collateral value. A loan-to-value ratio of less than 100 indicates an excess of collateral value over the loan amount. Generally, the higher the loan-to-value ratio, the higher the risk of experiencing a credit loss. The debt-service coverage ratio compares a property s net operating income to amounts needed to service the principal and interest due under the loan. Generally, the lower the debt-service coverage ratio, the higher the risk of experiencing a credit loss. For our commercial mortgage loans, our average loan-to-value ratio was 68 and 65 at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, and our average debt-service coverage ratio was 2.3x at both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The debt-service coverage ratio, as well as the values utilized in calculating the ratio, is updated annually on a rolling basis, with a portion of the portfolio updated each quarter. In addition, the loan-to-value ratio is routinely updated for all but the lowest risk loans as part of our ongoing review of our commercial mortgage loan portfolio. For our agricultural mortgage loans, our average loan-to-value ratio was 48 and 47 at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The values utilized in calculating the agricultural mortgage loan loan-to-value ratio are developed in connection with the ongoing review of the agricultural loan portfolio and are routinely updated. 
 Mortgage Loan Allowance for Credit Losses . See Note 7 of the Notes to the Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for information about how the allowance for credit losses is established and monitored, as well as activity in and balances of the allowance for credit losses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

 Derivatives 
 
 Derivative Risks 
 We are exposed to various risks relating to our ongoing business operations, including interest rate, foreign currency exchange rate, credit and equity market risks. We use a variety of strategies to manage these risks, including the use of derivatives. See Note 8 of the Notes to the Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for: 
 information about the gross notional amount, estimated fair value, and primary underlying risk exposure of our derivatives by type of hedge designation, excluding embedded derivatives held at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023; and 
 the effects of derivatives in cash flow, fair value, or non-qualifying hedge relationships on the statements of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 See Business Segments and Corporate Other Annuities, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Risk Management Strategies included in our 2023 Annual Report for more information about our use of derivatives by major hedging programs. In addition, see Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Results of Operations Annual Actuarial Review and Risk Factors Risks Related to our Investment Portfolio Our investment portfolio is subject to significant financial risks both in the U.S. and global financial markets, including credit risk, interest rate risk, inflation risk, market valuation risk, liquidity risk, real estate risk, derivatives risk, and other factors outside our control, the occurrence of any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations included in our 2023 Annual Report. 
 
 Fair Value Hierarchy 
 See Note 9 of the Notes to the Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for derivatives measured at estimated fair value on a recurring basis and their corresponding fair value hierarchy, as well as a rollforward of the fair value measurements for derivatives measured at estimated fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable (Level 3) inputs as discussed below. 
 The valuation of Level 3 derivatives involves the use of significant unobservable inputs and generally requires a higher degree of management judgment or estimation than the valuations of Level 1 and Level 2 derivatives. Although Level 3 inputs are unobservable, management believes they are consistent with what other market participants would use when pricing such instruments and are considered appropriate given the circumstances. The use of different inputs or methodologies could have a material effect on the estimated fair value of Level 3 derivatives and could materially affect net income. 
 Derivatives categorized as Level 3 at September 30, 2024 include: credit default swaps priced using unobservable credit spreads, or that are priced through independent broker quotations; and foreign currency swaps with certain unobservable inputs. 
 
 Credit Risk 
 See Note 8 of the Notes to the Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for information about how we manage credit risk related to derivatives and for the estimated fair value of our net derivative assets and net derivative liabilities after the application of master netting agreements and collateral. See Risk Factors Risks Related to our Investment Portfolio Our investment portfolio is subject to significant financial risks both in the U.S. and global financial markets, including credit risk, interest rate risk, inflation risk, market valuation risk, liquidity risk, real estate risk, derivatives risk, and other factors outside our control, the occurrence of any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations included in our 2023 Annual Report. 
 Our policy is not to offset the fair value amounts recognized for derivatives executed with the same counterparty under the same master netting agreement. This policy applies to the recognition of derivatives on the balance sheet and does not affect our legal right of offset.

 Credit Derivatives 
 The gross notional amount and estimated fair value of credit default swaps were as follows at: 
 September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Gross Notional Amount Estimated Fair Value Gross Notional Amount Estimated Fair Value (In millions) Written 1,095 20 1,405 27 Total 1,095 20 1,405 27 
 The maximum amount at risk related to our written credit default swaps is equal to the corresponding gross notional amount. In a replication transaction, we pair an asset on our balance sheet with a written credit default swap to synthetically replicate a corporate bond, a core asset holding of life insurance companies. Replications are entered into in accordance with the guidelines approved by state insurance regulators and the NAIC and are an important tool in managing the overall corporate credit risk within the Company. In order to match our long-dated insurance liabilities, we seek to buy long-dated corporate bonds. In some instances, these may not be readily available in the market, or they may be issued by corporations to which we already have significant corporate credit exposure. For example, by purchasing Treasury bonds (or other high-quality assets) and associating them with written credit default swaps on the desired corporate credit name, we can replicate the desired bond exposures and meet our ALM needs. This can expose the Company to changes in credit spreads as the written credit default swap tenor is shorter than the maturity of Treasury bonds. 
 
 Embedded Derivatives 
 See Note 9 of the Notes to the Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for (i) information about embedded derivatives measured at estimated fair value on a recurring basis and their corresponding fair value hierarchy and (ii) a rollforward of the fair value measurements for net embedded derivatives measured at estimated fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable (Level 3) inputs. 
 See Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Summary of Critical Accounting Estimates Derivatives included in our 2023 Annual Report for additional information on the estimates and assumptions that affect embedded derivatives. 
 
 Policyholder Liabilities 
 We establish, and carry as liabilities, actuarially determined amounts that are calculated to meet policy obligations or to provide for future annuity and life insurance benefit payments. Amounts for actuarial liabilities are computed and reported in the financial statements in conformity with GAAP. See Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Summary of Critical Accounting Estimates and Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Policyholder Liabilities included in our 2023 Annual Report for more details on policyholder liabilities. 
 
 Future Policy Benefits 
 We establish liabilities for future amounts payable under insurance policies. See Note 3 of the Notes to the Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 
 Policyholder Account Balances 
 Policyholder account balance liabilities are established for products with an explicit account value and generally equal to the balance accrued to the contract holder, which includes accrued interest credited, but excludes the impact of any applicable charge that may be incurred upon surrender. See Note 3 of the Notes to the Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 
 Market Risk Benefits 
 We issue certain variable annuity products with guaranteed minimum benefits GMxB that provide the policyholder a minimum return based on their initial deposit (i.e., the Benefit Base) less withdrawals. In some cases, the Benefit Base may be increased by additional deposits, bonus amounts, accruals or optional market value step-ups. Variable annuity guaranteed benefits are classified as MRBs and measured at fair value. Certain index-linked annuity products may also have GMxBs classified as MRBs. See Note 4 of the Notes to the Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.

 Select information that management considers relevant to understanding our variable annuity risk management strategy has been included below. 
 
 Net Amount at Risk 
 The net amount at risk NAR for the guaranteed minimum income benefits GMIB is the amount (if any) that would be required to be added to the total account value to purchase a lifetime income stream, based on current annuity rates, equal to the minimum amount provided under the guaranteed benefit. This amount represents our potential economic exposure to such guarantees in the event all contract holders were to annuitize on the balance sheet date, even though the guaranteed amount under the contract may not be annuitized until after the waiting period of the contract. 
 The NAR for the guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefits GMWB is the amount of guaranteed benefits in excess of the account values (if any) as of the balance sheet date and assumes utilization of benefits by all contract holders as of the balance sheet date. Only a small portion of the Benefit Base is available for withdrawal on an annual basis. 
 The NAR for the guaranteed minimum accumulation benefits GMAB is the amount of guaranteed benefits in excess of the account values (if any) as of the balance sheet date and assumes utilization of benefits by all contract holders as of the balance sheet. The NAR for the GMAB is not available until the GMAB maturity date. 
 The NAR for the guaranteed minimum death benefits GMDB is the amount of death benefit in excess of the account value (if any) as of the balance sheet date. It represents the amount of the claim we would incur if death claims were made on all contracts on the balance sheet date and includes any additional contractual claims associated with riders purchased to assist with covering income taxes payable upon death.

 Reserves 
 Under GAAP, variable annuity guarantees are classified as MRBs, measured at estimated fair value, and are reported in market risk benefit assets and liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets, with changes reported in change in market risk benefits on the consolidated statements of operations, except for changes related to nonperformance risk, which are reported in other comprehensive income on the consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss). Additionally, the index protection and accumulation features of Shield annuities are accounted for as embedded derivatives, measured at estimated fair value, and are reported in policyholder account balances on the consolidated balance sheets, with changes reported in net derivative gains (losses) on the consolidated statements of operations. These liabilities were valued at 10.8 billion at September 30, 2024. 
 Our variable annuity MRBs by type of GMxB were as follows at:

 The estimated fair value of these guarantees can change significantly due to changes in interest rates, equity indices, market volatility and variations in actuarial assumptions, including policyholder behavior, mortality and risk margins related to non-capital markets inputs, as well as changes in nonperformance risk. See Risk Factors Risks Related to Our Business Guarantees within certain of our annuity products may decrease our earnings, decrease our capitalization, increase the volatility of our results, result in higher risk management costs and expose us to increased market risk included in our 2023 Annual Report.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Our business and results of operations are materially affected by conditions in the global capital markets and the economy generally. Stressed conditions, volatility or disruptions in global capital markets, particular markets or financial asset classes can impact us adversely, in part because we have a large investment portfolio and our insurance liabilities and derivatives are sensitive to changing market factors. Changing conditions in the global capital markets and the economy may affect our financing costs and market interest rates for our debt or equity securities. For further information regarding market factors that could affect our ability to meet liquidity and capital needs, see Industry Trends and Uncertainties Financial and Economic Environment, as well as Risk Factors Economic Environment and Capital Markets-Related Risks and Risk Factors Risks Related to Our Investment Portfolio included in our 2023 Annual Report. 
 Liquidity and Capital Management 
 Based upon our capitalization, expectations regarding maintaining our business mix, ratings, and funding sources available to us, we believe we have sufficient liquidity to meet business requirements in current market conditions and certain stress scenarios. BHF s Board of Directors and senior management are directly involved in the governance of the capital management process, including proposed changes to the annual capital plan and capital targets. We continuously monitor and adjust our liquidity and capital plans in light of market conditions, as well as changing needs and opportunities. 
 We maintain a substantial short-term liquidity position, which was 5.7 billion and 3.8 billion at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Short-term liquidity is comprised of cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments, excluding assets that are pledged or otherwise committed. Assets pledged or otherwise committed include amounts received in connection with securities lending, derivatives and assets held on deposit or in trust. 
 An integral part of our liquidity management includes managing our level of liquid assets, which was 51.5 billion and 45.2 billion at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Liquid assets are comprised of cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and publicly-traded securities, excluding assets that are pledged or otherwise committed. Assets pledged or otherwise committed include amounts received in connection with securities lending, funding agreements, derivatives and assets held on deposit or in trust.

 The Company 
 Liquidity 
 Liquidity refers to our ability to generate adequate cash flows from our normal operations to meet the cash requirements of our operating, investing and financing activities. We determine our liquidity needs based on a rolling 12-month forecast by portfolio of invested assets, which we monitor daily. We adjust the general account asset and derivatives mix and general account asset maturities based on this rolling 12-month forecast. To support this forecast, we conduct cash flow and stress testing, which reflects the impact of various scenarios, including (i) the potential increase in our requirement to pledge additional collateral or return collateral to our counterparties, (ii) a reduction in new business sales, and (iii) the risk of early contract holder and policyholder withdrawals, as well as lapses and surrenders of existing policies and contracts. We include provisions limiting withdrawal rights in many of our products, which deter the customer from making withdrawals prior to the maturity date of the product. If significant cash is required beyond our anticipated liquidity needs, we have various alternatives available depending on market conditions and the amount and timing of the liquidity need. These available alternative sources of liquidity include cash flows from operations, sales of liquid assets and funding sources, including secured funding agreements, unsecured credit facilities and secured committed facilities. 
 Under certain adverse market and economic conditions, our access to liquidity may deteriorate, or the cost to access liquidity may increase. See Risk Factors Economic Environment and Capital Markets-Related Risks Adverse capital and credit market conditions may significantly affect our ability to meet liquidity needs and our access to capital in our 2023 Annual Report. 
 Capital 
 We manage our capital position to maintain our financial strength and credit ratings. Our capital position is supported by our ability to generate cash flows within our insurance subsidiaries, our ability to effectively manage the risks of our businesses and our expected ability to borrow funds and raise additional capital to meet operating and growth needs under a variety of market and economic conditions. 
 We monitor our debt-to-capital ratio using an average of our key leverage ratios as calculated by A.M. Best, Fitch, Moody s and S P, and we aim to maintain a ratio commensurate with our financial strength and credit ratings. As such, we may opportunistically look to pursue additional financing over time, which may include borrowings under credit facilities, the issuance of debt, equity or hybrid securities, the incurrence of term loans, or the refinancing or extinguishment of existing indebtedness. There can be no assurance that we will be able to complete any such financing transactions on terms and conditions favorable to us or at all. 
 In support of our target combined risk-based capital RBC ratio of 400 to 450 in normal market conditions, we expect to continue to maintain a capital and exposure risk management program that targets total assets supporting our variable annuity contracts at or above the average of the worst two percent of a set of capital markets scenarios over the life of the contracts level in normal market conditions. With our risk management focus on the core drivers of our combined RBC ratio, we believe we can better manage our RBC in stressed market scenarios. 
 We have a share repurchase program under which repurchases may be made through open market purchases, including pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 plans or pursuant to accelerated stock repurchase plans, or through privately negotiated transactions, from time to time at management s discretion in accordance with applicable legal requirements. Common stock repurchases are dependent upon several factors, including our capital position, liquidity, financial strength and credit ratings, general market conditions, the market price of our common stock compared to management s assessment of the stock s underlying value and applicable regulatory approvals, as well as other legal and accounting factors. 
 We currently have no plans to declare and pay dividends on our common stock. Any future declaration and payment of dividends or other distributions or returns of capital will be at the discretion of BHF s Board of Directors and will depend on and be subject to our financial condition, results of operations, cash needs, regulatory and other constraints, capital requirements (including capital requirements of our insurance subsidiaries), contractual restrictions and any other factors that BHF s Board of Directors deems relevant in making such a determination. Therefore, there can be no assurance that we will pay any dividends or make other distributions or returns of capital on our common stock, or as to the amount of any such dividends, distributions or returns of capital.

 Cash Flows from Operating Activities 
 The principal cash inflows from our insurance activities come from insurance premiums, annuity considerations and net investment income. The principal cash outflows are the result of various annuity and life insurance products, operating expenses and income tax, as well as interest expense. The primary liquidity concern with respect to these cash flows is the risk of early contract holder and policyholder withdrawal. 
 Cash Flows from Investing Activities 
 The principal cash inflows from our investment activities come from repayments of principal, proceeds from maturities and sales of investments, as well as settlements of freestanding derivatives. The principal cash outflows relate to purchases of investments and settlements of freestanding derivatives. We typically can have a net cash outflow from investing activities because cash inflows from insurance operations are reinvested in accordance with our ALM discipline to fund insurance liabilities. We closely monitor and manage these risks through our comprehensive investment risk management process. The primary liquidity concerns with respect to these cash flows are the risk of default by debtors and market disruption. 
 Cash Flows from Financing Activities 
 The principal cash inflows from our financing activities come from issuances of debt and equity securities, deposits of funds associated with policyholder account balances and lending of securities. The principal cash outflows come from repayments of debt, common stock repurchases, preferred stock dividends, withdrawals associated with policyholder account balances and the return of securities on loan. The primary liquidity concerns with respect to these cash flows are market disruption and the risk of early policyholder withdrawal.

 Credit and Committed Facilities 
 See Notes 12 and 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in our 2023 Annual Report for information regarding our credit and committed facilities. 
 We have no reason to believe that our lending counterparties would be unable to fulfill their respective contractual obligations under these facilities. As commitments under our credit and committed facilities may expire unused, these amounts do not necessarily reflect our actual future cash funding requirements. 
 Our Revolving Credit Facility contains financial covenants, including requirements to maintain a specified minimum adjusted consolidated net worth, to maintain a ratio of total indebtedness to total capitalization not in excess of a specified percentage and that place limitations on the dollar amount of indebtedness that may be incurred by our subsidiaries, which could restrict our operations and use of funds. At September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with these financial covenants. 
 Primary Uses of Liquidity and Capital 
 In addition to the summarized description of liquidity and capital uses discussed in Sources and Uses of Liquidity and Capital, the following additional information is provided regarding our primary uses of liquidity and capital: 
 Common Stock Repurchases 
 See Note 10 of the Notes to the Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for information relating to authorizations to repurchase BHF common stock, amounts of common stock repurchased pursuant to such authorizations and the amount remaining under such authorizations at September 30, 2024. Subsequent to September 30, 2024 and through November 1, 2024, BHF repurchased an additional 506,800 shares of its common stock through open market purchases pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 plan for 24 million.

Table of Contents 

 Dividend Stopper Provisions in BHF s Preferred Stock and Junior Subordinated Debentures 
 Terms applicable to our junior subordinated debentures may restrict our ability to pay interest on those debentures in certain circumstances. Suspension of payments of interest on our junior subordinated debentures, whether required under the relevant indenture or optional, could cause dividend stopper provisions applicable under those and other instruments to restrict our ability to pay dividends, if any, on our common stock and repurchase our common stock in various situations, including situations where we may be experiencing financial stress, and may restrict our ability to pay dividends or interest on our preferred stock and junior subordinated debentures as well. Similarly, the terms of our outstanding preferred stock contain restrictions on our ability to repurchase our common stock or pay dividends thereon if we have not fulfilled our dividend obligations under such preferred stock or other preferred securities. In addition, the terms of the agreements governing any preferred stock, debt or other financial instruments that we may issue in the future, may limit or prohibit the payment of dividends on our common stock or preferred stock, or the payment of interest on our junior subordinated debentures. 
 Debt Repayments, Repurchases, Redemptions and Exchanges 
 See Note 12 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in our 2023 Annual Report for information on debt repayments and repurchases, as well as debt maturities and the terms of our outstanding long-term debt. 
 We may from time to time seek to retire or purchase our outstanding indebtedness through cash purchases or exchanges for other securities, purchases in the open market, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Any such repurchases or exchanges will be dependent upon several factors, including our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions, general market conditions, as well as applicable regulatory, legal and accounting factors. Whether or not we repurchase any debt and the size and timing of any such repurchases will be determined at our discretion. 
 Insurance Liabilities 
 Liabilities arising from our insurance activities primarily relate to benefit payments under various annuity and life insurance products, as well as payments for policy surrenders, withdrawals and loans. See Primary Sources of Liquidity and Capital Funding Sources Funding Agreements for additional information regarding our institutional spread margin business. 
 Pledged Collateral 
 We enter into derivatives to manage various risks relating to our ongoing business operations. We pledge collateral to, and have collateral pledged to us by, counterparties in connection with our derivatives. At September 30, 2024, we did not pledge any cash collateral to counterparties. At December 31, 2023, we pledged 16 million of cash collateral to counterparties. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we were obligated to return cash collateral pledged to us by counterparties of 659 million and 393 million, respectively. The timing of the return of the derivatives collateral is uncertain. See Note 8 of the Notes to the Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about pledged collateral. We also pledge collateral from time to time in connection with our funding agreements. 
 We receive non-cash collateral from counterparties for derivatives, which can be sold or re-pledged subject to certain constraints, and which is not recorded on our consolidated balance sheets. The amount of this non-cash collateral at estimated fair value was 2.4 billion at both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
 Securities Lending 
 We have a securities lending program that aims to enhance the total return on our investment portfolio, whereby securities are loaned to third parties, primarily brokerage firms and commercial banks. We obtain collateral, usually cash, from the borrower, which must be returned to the borrower when the loaned securities are returned to us. Generally, our securities lending contracts expire within twelve months of issuance. We were liable for cash collateral under our control of 3.3 billion at both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
 We receive non-cash collateral for securities lending from counterparties, which cannot be sold or re-pledged, and which is not recorded on our consolidated balance sheets. There was no non-cash collateral at both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
 See Note 7 of the Notes to the Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of our securities lending program.

 Contingencies, Commitments and Guarantees 
 We establish liabilities for litigation, regulatory and other loss contingencies when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. See Note 13 of the Notes to the Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding contingencies. 
 We enter into commitments for the purpose of enhancing the total return on our investment portfolio consisting of commitments to fund partnership investments, bank credit facilities and private corporate bond investments, as well as commitments to lend funds under mortgage loan commitments. We anticipate these commitments could be invested any time over the next five years. See Notes 7 and 13 of the Notes to the Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding commitments. 
 In the normal course of our business, we have provided certain indemnities, guarantees and commitments to third parties such that we may be required to make payments now or in the future. See Note 13 of the Notes to the Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding guarantees. 
 
 The Parent Company 
 Liquidity and Capital 
 In evaluating liquidity, it is important to distinguish the cash flow needs of the parent company from the cash flow needs of the combined group of companies. BHF is largely dependent on cash flows from its insurance subsidiaries to meet its obligations. Constraints on BHF s liquidity may occur as a result of operational demands or as a result of compliance with regulatory requirements. 
 Short-term Liquidity and Liquid Assets 
 At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, BHF and certain of its non-insurance subsidiaries had short-term liquidity of 1.1 billion and 1.2 billion, respectively. Short-term liquidity is comprised of cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments, excluding assets that are pledged or otherwise committed. Assets pledged or otherwise committed include assets held in trust. 
 At both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, BHF and certain of its non-insurance subsidiaries had liquid assets of 1.3 billion, of which 1.2 billion was held by BHF. Liquid assets are comprised of cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and publicly-traded securities, excluding assets that are pledged or otherwise committed. Assets pledged or otherwise committed include assets held in trust. 
 Statutory Capital and Dividends 
 The NAIC and state insurance departments have established regulations that provide minimum capitalization requirements based on RBC formulas for insurance companies. RBC is based on a formula calculated by applying factors to various asset, premium, claim, expense and statutory reserve items. The formula takes into account the risk characteristics of the insurer, including asset risk, insurance risk, interest rate risk, market risk and business risk and is calculated on an annual basis. The formula is used as an early warning regulatory tool to identify possible inadequately capitalized insurers for purposes of initiating regulatory action, and not as a means to rank insurers generally. State insurance laws provide insurance regulators the authority to require various actions by, or take various actions against, insurers whose total adjusted capital TAC does not meet or exceed the amounts required to attain certain RBC levels. As of the date of the most recent annual statutory financial statements filed with insurance regulators, the TAC of each of our insurance subsidiaries subject to these requirements was in excess of the amounts required to attain each of those RBC levels. 
 The amount of dividends that our insurance subsidiaries can ultimately pay to BHF through their various parent entities provides an additional margin for risk protection and investment in our businesses. Such dividends are constrained by the amount of surplus our insurance subsidiaries hold to maintain their ratings, which is generally higher than minimum RBC requirements. We proactively take actions to maintain capital consistent with these ratings objectives, which may include adjusting dividend amounts and deploying financial resources from internal or external sources of capital. Certain of these activities may require regulatory approval. Furthermore, the payment of dividends and other distributions by our insurance subsidiaries is governed by the insurance laws and regulations of the states where they are domiciled. Any payment of dividends by Brighthouse Life Insurance Company in 2024 would be subject to Delaware Department of Insurance approval. See Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in our 2023 Annual Report for additional information regarding the applicable dividend restrictions and certain of our subsidiaries ordinary dividend capacity, as well as the circumstances under which regulatory approval would be required.

 Primary Sources and Uses of Liquidity and Capital 
 The principal sources of funds available to BHF include distributions from Brighthouse Holdings, LLC BH Holdings ), dividends and returns of capital from its insurance subsidiaries and BRCD, capital markets issuances, as well as its own cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments. These sources of funds may also be supplemented by alternate sources of liquidity either directly or indirectly through our insurance subsidiaries. For example, we have established internal liquidity facilities to provide liquidity within and across our regulated and non-regulated entities to support our businesses. 
 The primary uses of liquidity of BHF include debt-service obligations (including interest expense and debt repayments), preferred stock dividends, capital contributions to subsidiaries, common stock repurchases and payment of general operating expenses. Based on our analysis and comparison of our current and future cash inflows from the dividends we receive from subsidiaries that are permitted to be paid without prior insurance regulatory approval, our investment portfolio and other cash flows and anticipated access to the capital markets, we believe there will be sufficient liquidity and capital to enable BHF to make payments on debt, pay preferred stock dividends, contribute capital to its subsidiaries, repurchase its common stock, pay all general operating expenses and meet its cash needs. 
 In addition to the liquidity and capital sources discussed in The Company Primary Sources of Liquidity and Capital and The Company Primary Uses of Liquidity and Capital, the following additional information is provided regarding BHF s primary sources and uses of liquidity and capital: 
 Distributions from and Capital Contributions to BH Holdings 
 During both the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, BHF did not receive any cash distributions from BH Holdings and did not make any cash capital contributions to BH Holdings. 
 Short-term Intercompany Loans 
 BHF, as borrower, has a short-term intercompany loan agreement with certain of its non-insurance subsidiaries, as lenders, for the purposes of facilitating the management of the available cash of the borrower and the lenders on a short-term and consolidated basis. Such intercompany loan agreement allows management to optimize the efficient use of and maximize the yield on cash between BHF and its subsidiary lenders. Each loan entered into under this intercompany loan agreement has a term not more than 364 days and bears interest on the unpaid principal amount at a variable rate, payable monthly. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, BHF borrowed 420 million and 569 million, respectively, from certain of its non-insurance subsidiaries and repaid 180 million and 369 million of such borrowings during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, BHF had total obligations outstanding of 967 million and 727 million, respectively, under such agreements. 
 Intercompany Liquidity Facilities 
 BHF has established intercompany liquidity facilities with certain of its insurance and non-insurance subsidiaries to provide short-term liquidity within and across the combined group of companies. Under these facilities, which are comprised of a series of revolving loan agreements among BHF and its participating subsidiaries, each company may lend to or borrow from each other, subject to certain maximum limits for a term of up to 364 days, depending on the agreement. During both the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, there were no borrowings or repayments by BHF under these facilities and, at both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, BHF had no obligations outstanding under such facilities.

 Corporate Information 
 We routinely use our Investor Relations website to provide presentations, press releases, our insurance subsidiaries statutory filings, and other information that may be deemed important or material to investors. Accordingly, we encourage investors and others interested in the Company to review the information that we share at http://investor.brighthousefinancial.com. In addition, our Investor Relations website allows interested persons to sign up to automatically receive e-mail alerts when we make filings with the SEC. Information contained on or connected to any website referenced in this report or any of our other filings with the SEC is not incorporated by reference in this report or in any other report or document we file with the SEC, and any website references are intended to be inactive textual references only unless expressly noted. 
 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 
 We have exposure to market risk through our insurance operations and general account investment activities. For purposes of this discussion, market risk is defined as changes in estimated fair value resulting from changes in interest rates, equity market prices, credit spreads and foreign currency exchange rates. We regularly analyze our market risk exposure. As a result of that analysis, we have determined that the estimated fair values of certain assets and liabilities are significantly exposed to changes in interest rates, and to a lesser extent, to changes in equity market prices and foreign currency exchange rates. We may have additional financial impacts other than changes in estimated fair value, which are beyond the scope of this discussion. A description of our market risk exposures may be found under Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk in our 2023 Annual Report. 
 There have been no material changes to our market risk exposures from the market risk exposures previously disclosed in our 2023 Annual Report.

Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer have concluded that these disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024.
