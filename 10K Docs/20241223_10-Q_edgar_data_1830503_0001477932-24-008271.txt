Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Our management s discussion and analysis provides a narrative about our financial performance and condition that should be read in conjunction with the audited and unaudited consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q. This discussion contains forward looking statements reflecting our current expectations and estimates and assumptions about events and trends that may affect our future operating results or financial position. Our actual results and the timing of certain events could differ materially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements due to a number of factors, including, but not limited to, those set forth in the sections of our annual report on Form 10-K titled Risk Factors . Results of Operations For the Three Months Ended February 29, 2024 and February 28, 2023 Revenues For the three months ended February 29, 2024, and February 28, 2023 the Company had revenues of 678,276 and 877,281, respectively. The decrease is a result of a loss of clients in the FluidFi subsidiary due the previous ownership groups commitments to clients that were impossible to achieve, coupled with an overall objective of the Company to only keep clients software projects that could be served at a profit or a return on investment in a reasonable amount of time. The decrease in cost of sales for the three months ended February 29, 2024 was 506,916, compared to 609,208 for the three months ended February 28, 2023, which is in relation to the decrease in revenue. Operating Expenses Operating expenses for the three months period ending on February 29, 2024 were 749,283 down from 983,920 for the three months ended February 28, 2023. This reduction was due to lower salaries and wages, which decreased from 611,600 to 407,489. Professional services also saw a notable reduction from 139,970 to 114,794, and general and administrative expenses decreased from 206,342 to 148,431, reflecting the Company s efforts to streamline operations and reduce overhead costs. Professional services expenses increased to 157,910 from 101,635, due to an increase in legal expenses. The net effect was a decrease in the operating loss for the period ending February 29, 2024 of 137,789 compared to the period ended February 28, 2023. This is the second period in a row that The Company has had a significant reduction in operating losses for the period as it seeks to achieve its goal of reaching profitability as efficiently and promptly as possible. Net Loss For the three months ended February 29, 2024 and February 28, 2023 we had Net (Loss) of (3,194,774) and (2,496,253) respectively. The majority of the increased net loss was attributable an increase in interest expense from 95,327 in the previous year compared to 465,554 in the current period, which is attributable to the Company renegotiating terms on some institutional debt, so no monthly payments would be due until December of 2025. 3 For the Six Months Ended February 29, 2024 and February 28, 2023 Revenues For the six months ended February 29, 2024 and February 28, 2023, the Company had revenues of 1,797,329 and 2,333,023, respectively. The decrease is a result of a loss of clients in the FluidFi subsidiary due the previous ownership groups commitments to clients that were impossible to achieve, coupled with an overall objective of the Company to only keep clients software projects that could be served at a profit or a return on investment in a reasonable amount of time. The decrease in cost of sales for the six months ended February 29, 2024 was 306,647, which is in relation to the decrease in revenue. Operating Expenses Operating expenses for the six months period ending on February 29, 2024 were 1,525,343 down from 2,154,776 for the six months ended February 28, 2023. This reduction was due to lower salaries and wages, which decreased from 1,389,907 to 858,739. General and administrative expenses decreased from 431,010 to 277,503 reflecting the Company s efforts to streamline operations and reduce overhead costs. Professional services expenses increased to 272,704 from 241,605, due to an increase in legal expenses. The net effect was a decrease in the operating loss for the six months ending February 29, 2024 of 400,386 compared to the six months ended February 28, 2023. This is the second period in a row that The Company has had a significant reduction in operating losses for the period as it seeks to achieve its goal of reaching profitability as efficiently and promptly as possible. Net Loss For the six months ended February 29, 2024 and February 28, 2023 we had a net loss of 4,217,343 and 3,486,494, respectively. The majority of the increased net loss was attributable to an increase in interest expense from 283,216 in the previous year compared to 974,923 for the six months ended February 29, 2024, which is attributable to the Company renegotiating terms on some institutional debt, so no monthly payments would be due until December of 2025 Assets and Liabilities As of February 29, 2024, total assets were 2,163,485, down from 2,469,268 as of August 31, 2023. The decrease in assets was due to a reduction in cash and cash equivalents, which declined to 46,308 from 144,171, and a reduction in the current portion of loans receivables from 46,260 to 4,638 as we collected the last payments from our small business lending solution that we stopped offering to customers. Accounts receivable decreased as well to 125,262 from 174,520, reflecting that we were able to collect from our clients more quickly. Total current liabilities as of February 29, 2024, decreased to 5,420,182 from 6,264,834 as of August 31, 2023. The majority of the decrease is attributable to the payable associated with the acquisition of Helix House of 950,000, which was converted to equity. The contingent liability is 2,916,860 as of February 29, 2024. Total liabilities were 11,760,926 as of February 29, 2024, which was an increase from 8,707,254 as of August 31, 2023. This increase was mainly due to the issuance of convertible notes payable with a carrying value of 3,422,016. The Company continues to manage its liabilities carefully to maintain financial stability. 4 Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash used by operating activities The Company s net cash from operating activities was (577,157) for the six months ended February 29, 2024 compared to (777,892) for the six months ended February 28, 2023. This reduction in cash outflow is primarily attributed to the following significant changes: Net Loss: The net loss for the period increased to 4,217,343 from 3,486,494, reflecting an improvement in operational results. Amortization of Debt Discount: Amortization expense increased to 797,195, compared to 160,316 in the previous period, contributing to the higher cash outflows. Derivative Liability: The change in the fair value of the derivative liability generated a positive adjustment of 2,090, compared to 196,666) in the prior period, which provided a smaller non-cash offset to the net loss. Accounts Payable and Accrued Liabilities: This line decreased, with an addition of 462,393 in the current period versus 534,786 in the prior period, impacting operating cash flow positively. Contingent Liability: The contingent liability, net of discount, was 0 in the current period but contributed 2,509,620 in the prior period, impacting the comparative cash outflows. Cash provided by investing activities Net cash from investing activities was 41,622 for the six-month period ended February 29, 2024, as compared to net cash of 96,584 for the same period the previous year ended February 28, 2023. This decrease primarily resulted from payments on loans receivable totaled 41,622, a decline from 98,436 in the prior period. This reduction was due to lower collections from loan repayments during the period because the company shut the program down and stopped offering new loans, so there was less money to collect. Cash provided by financing activities Net cash from financing activities amounted to 437,672 for the six months ended February 29, 2024, compared to 756,656 in the same period of 2023. The key changes in financing cash flows include: Proceeds from convertible notes payable: This new source of cash generated 402,385, which did not occur in the prior period. Payments of Notes Payable, Related Party: Payments on related party notes payable increased significantly, amounting to 54,156, up from 3,128 in the prior period. Overall Cash Flow and Ending Balance The total decrease in cash and cash equivalents was 97,863 for the six months ended February 29, 2024, compared to an increase of 75,349 in the previous period. This decline is largely driven by reduced collections in investing activities and increased reliance on financing activities for liquidity. The ending cash balance as of February 29, 2024, was 46,308. We currently do not have sufficient capital to fund our cash needs for the next 12 months. We intend to rely on financing from convertible debt, promissory notes, and sale of stock to fund our operations. Going concern The accompanying financial statements have been prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP, which contemplate continuation of the Company as a going concern for a period of one year from the issuance of these financial statements. For the six months ended February 29, 2024, the Company had 1,797,329 in revenues, a net loss of 4,217,343 and had net cash used in operations of 577,157. Additionally, as of February 29, 2024, the Company had a working capital deficit, stockholders deficit and accumulated deficit of 5,167,714, 9,597,441, and 20,559,643, respectively. It is management s opinion that these conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern for a period of twelve months from the date of the issuance of these financial statements. The financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effect on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that may result from the outcome of this uncertainty. Successful integration of the Company s recent business acquisitions and, ultimately, the attainment of profitable operations are dependent upon future events, and ultimately achieving a level of sales adequate to support the Company s cost structure. However, there can be no assurances that the Company will be able to secure additional equity investments or achieve an adequate sales level. 5 Item 3.
