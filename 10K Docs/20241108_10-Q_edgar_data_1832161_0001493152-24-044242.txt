 NOTES
TO THE UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

 SEPTEMBER
30, 2024 AND 2023 

Operating
results for the three month period ended September 30, 2024, are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the
year ending June 30, 2025. The condensed consolidated balance sheet at June 30, 2024, has been derived from the audited financial statements
at that date but does not include all of the information and footnotes required by generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S.
for complete financial statements. 

as of September 30, 2024. The Company had a net loss from operations of and negative cash flows of from
operations for the three months ended September 30, 2024. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the entity s ability to
continue as a going concern for a period of one year from the issuance of these financial statements. 

The
Company is dependent upon, among other things, achieving a level of profitable operations and receiving additional cash infusions including
securing additional lines of credit and raising additional capital through placement of preferred and/or common stock in order to implement
its business plan. There can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in order to continue as a going concern. The Company
is funding its initial operations by securing a related party line of credit, a related party note payable, a note payable, issuing preferred
stock, and issuing common stock through private placements. 

We
cannot be certain that capital will be provided when it is required or in amounts sufficient to meet our operating requirements. Management
believes the existing shareholders, the prospective new investors, and future sales will provide the additional cash needed to meet the
Company s obligations as they become due and will allow the development of its core business operations. No assurance can be given
that any future financing will be available or, if available, that it will be on terms that are satisfactory to the Company. Even if
the Company is able to obtain additional financing, it may contain restrictions on our operations, in the case of debt financing, or
cause substantial dilution for our stockholders, in the case of equity financing. 

. The Company has not experienced any losses in such accounts and believes
it is not exposed to any significant credit risk in these accounts.

to years 

. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are expensed
as incurred. When retired or otherwise disposed of, the related carrying value and accumulated depreciation are removed from the respective
accounts and the net difference less any amount realized from the disposition is reflected in earnings. Developed technology is principally
related to technological assets acquired through Asset Purchase Agreements which are recorded at relative fair value based on the purchase
consideration, less accumulated amortization on the balance sheet. Amortization is calculated using the straight-line method over the
asset s estimated useful life. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. When retired or otherwise disposed
of, the related carrying value and accumulated depreciation are removed from the respective accounts, and the net difference less any
amount realized from the disposition is reflected in earnings. Developed technology was placed in service on June 8, 2023. See Note 3.

has a monthly lease payment of . 

Total
rental expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was and , respectively. 

ASC
Topic 842 provides for certain practical expedients when adopting the guidance. The Company elected to apply the short-term lease exception;
therefore, the Company will not record an ROU asset or corresponding lease liability for leases with an initial term of twelve months
or less that are not reasonably certain of being renewed and instead will recognize a single lease cost allocated over the lease term,
generally on a straight-line basis. 

The
Company s derivative liabilities are carried at fair value and are classified as Level 3 liabilities. 

The
Company s financial instruments consist principally of cash, prepaid expenses, accounts payable, accrued expenses, related party
notes payable, related party line of credit, and notes payable approximate the fair value because of their short maturities.

Fair
value estimates are made at a specific point in time, based on relevant market information and information about the financial statement.
These estimates are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment and therefore cannot be determined
with precision. Changes in assumptions could transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between willing and able maker participants.
In general, the Company s policy in estimating fair values is to first look at observable market prices for the identical assets
and liabilities in active markets, where available. When these are not available other inputs used to model fair value such as prices
of similar instruments, yield curves, volatilities., prepayment speeds, default rates credit spreads, rely first on observable data from
active markets. Depending on the availability of observable inputs and prices, different valuation models could produce materially different
fair value estimates. The values presented may not represent future fair value as discussed above.

Overview 

As
used in this Quarterly Report and unless otherwise indicated, the terms the Company, we , us 
and our mean VIP Play, Inc., a Nevada corporation formed on April 16, 2020. 

In
the summer of 2022, our business consisted solely of providing online retail sales of masks and similar products and convention services
(together, prior business). Through our e-commerce sales channel, we sold KN-95 facemasks, disposable facemasks, and disinfectant wipes
through an online store in the United States of America (US). Through our convention sales channel, we offered convention services, which
connected US buyers to Chinese manufacturers. 

On
June 15, 2022, we hired a new Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer along with certain key employees of ZenSports, Inc.
to explore business opportunities related to software and mobile application development and services related to such technology. 

On
August 26, 2022, we entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement to purchase certain technological assets, as well as the brand ZenSports,
from ZenSports, Inc. The assets were purchased to allow us to offer online sports betting, eSports, DeFi fintech and various entertainment
services, on a direct-to-consumer (B2C) and business-to-business basis. We did not acquire the entity ZenSports Inc. On September 12,
2022, we entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement with Excel Members, LLC, a company controlled by Bruce Cassidy, a member of our Board
of Directors (the Board ), to acquire certain assets of a company acquired previously by Excel Members through an assignment
for the benefit of creditors. Ultimate Gamer, LLC, which was formerly in the business of organizing and operating in-person and online
video game competitions tournament, originally owned these assets. The purchased assets included the brand name Ultimate Gamer. 

On
September 15, 2022, we entered into an agreement to assign all of the assets in connection with or relating to our prior business owned
or used by us (discontinued operations), and to delegate any and all liabilities owed by us, to TopSight Corporation, a company owned
by Zixiao Chen, our former Chief Financial Officer. 

As
a result of the foregoing transactions, we ceased all operations relating to our prior business and commenced operations relating to
B2C offerings within online sports betting (current business or business). With our current business, augmented by net new development
of products and services, we intend to pursue global business opportunities through a platform we ve designed to be a flexible
foundation for corporate growth. 

2 

Through
our ZenSports brand we offer a modern, full-featured, native mobile, and global online sports betting platform incorporating; a sports
book, peer-to-peer betting, eSports wagering, loyalty, and player retention. 

In
May 2023, we received approval on our Tennessee Sports Gaming Operator license, and we officially launched our sports betting operation
in Tennessee in June 2023. 

Our
current business is a mobile app and online-based technology company with no demand for a physical storefront location. The website for
our business is https://www.vipplayinc.com. The information on our website is not made a part of this Quarterly Report. Our headquarters
address is 1645 Pine Tree Ln, Suite 2, Sarasota, FL 34236. Our phone number is: (866) 783-9435. 

Results
of Operations for the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024, and 2023 

During
the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, we incurred net losses from continuing operations of 5,269,382 and 5,058,302,
respectively. 

For
the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we had negative gaming revenues of 3,337 and 218,624. Negative gaming revenues
consisted of net sports betting revenues which commenced in June of 2023 upon the approval of our gaming license. Our negative gaming
revenues decreased by approximately 215,000 during the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September
30, 2023. During the current quarter, we lowered our marketing expenses and betting limits, which led to lower betting handle that would
enable us to strategically focus on technology updates and risk management improvements. 

The
significant driver to our loss in the current period is principally related to the loss on change in fair value of derivatives, along
with increases in salaries, wages, and contracting fees to ready our acquired technology for operating in Tennessee as well as legal,
professional and abandoned jurisdictional licensing fees associated with our licensing activities and legal fees associated with fundraising.
Operating and sales and marketing costs contribute to our losses and are expected to increase over the coming months once we expand our
sports betting operations. In addition, we had non-cash expenses contributing to our loss for debt amortization costs of 640,662 and
 935,248, respectively, as part of the restructuring of the related party demand line of credit and interest expense on notes payable
of 374,201 and 656,583 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

Liquidity
is the ability of a company to generate funds to support its current and future operations, satisfy its obligations, and otherwise operate
on an ongoing basis. Significant factors in the management of liquidity are funds generated by operations, levels of accounts payable
and accrued expenditures, and capital expenditures, including the costs associated with internally developed software and attaining Sports
Gaming Operator licenses. 

As
of September 30, 2024, we had total current assets of 1,067,593, total current liabilities of 26,236,469, and a total working capital
deficit of 25,168,876. Net cash used in operating activities was 2,290,520 during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared
to 1,601,081 during the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in the use of cash in operating activities is principally
the result of a 1,816,912 decrease in net operating assets and liabilities and an increase in non-cash transactions of 1,338,552,
and an increase in the net loss of 211,079. 

Net
cash used in investing activities remained fairly consistent during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three
months ended September 30, 2023. 

Net
cash provided by financing activities decreased by 16,967 during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months
ended September 30, 2023. The decrease is primarily due to proceeds from convertible notes issued during the three months ended September
30, 2023, and is partially offset by increased draws from the related party demand line of credit during the three months ended September
30, 2024. 

3 

We
were incorporated on April 16, 2020. Since inception, our efforts and operations from our prior business to the date of disposition have
been devoted primarily to startup and development activities, resulting in negative cash flows and an accumulated deficit from inception
through disposition on September 15, 2022. During the three months ended September 30, 2022, we closed on acquisitions of certain assets
of ZenSports and Ultimate Gamer and divested our prior business. 

We
purchased the assets of ZenSports and Ultimate Gamer so we could offer gambling, eSports entertainment, and DeFi opportunities through
the acquired technology we are currently enhancing. In January 2023, John Linss our former Chief Executive Officer (CEO) resigned. As a result of this change in leadership and consultation with the Board, we adjusted our business plan to solely focus
on sports betting in one jurisdiction, Tennessee, for the foreseeable future. Our current management team believes this singular focus
will facilitate the revenue generation process more quickly and cost-effectively by focusing on our limited resources. 

As
of the filing date of this Quarterly Report, we have ceased all operations relating to our prior business and are focused on executing
our adjusted business plan for our current business. Since our current business has a limited history of generating revenues or operating
successfully, we will be dependent upon, among other things, achieving a level of profitable operations and receiving additional cash
infusions, including securing additional lines of credit and raising additional capital through the placement of preferred and/or common
stock in order to implement our business plan. Because of our limited operating history, it is difficult to predict our capital needs
on a monthly, quarterly, or annual basis. We will have limited capital available to us if we are unable to raise money through private
equity offerings or find alternate forms of financing, which we do not have in place at this time. 

Off
Balance Sheet Arrangements 

As
of September 30, 2024, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements. 

Going
Concern 

As
of September 30, 2024, we had a working capital deficit of 25,168,876. We had a net loss from operations of 5,269,382 for
the three months ended September 30, 2024. We do not expect significant revenues and we expect to incur significant increases in operating
costs in the short term as we commence our sports betting operations. The expected significant increases in costs will include, but not
be limited to, costs relating to obtaining gaming licenses, technology development, sales and marketing, and legal and professional fees. 

These
conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern for a period of one year from the issuance of these
financial statements. Because of these conditions, we will require additional working capital to develop business operations. Management s
plans are to raise additional working capital through the sale of debt and/or equity instruments as well as to generate revenues. There are no assurances that we will be able to achieve the level of revenues adequate to generate sufficient
cash flow from operations to support our working capital requirements. To the extent that funds generated are insufficient, we will have
to raise additional working capital. No assurance can be given that additional financing will be available, or if available, will be
on terms acceptable to us. If adequate working capital is not available, we may not be able to continue our operations. 

The
financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of asset-carrying amounts or the
amount and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern.

Item
3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risks 

A
smaller reporting company is not required to provide the information required by this Item. 

Item
4. Controls and Procedures 

Evaluation
of Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

We
carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange
Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) as of September 30, 2024. This evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation
of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective due to the presence of material
weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

In
connection with our continued monitoring and maintenance of our controls procedures as part of the implementation of Section 404 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act, we continue to review, test, and improve the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting. There
have not been any changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)
under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the first quarter of our fiscal year ended June 30, 2025, that have materially affected,
or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

2 

(b)
 For Other than Directors . If a quorum is present, unless the Articles of Incorporation, the Bylaws, the rules or regulations of
any stock exchange applicable to the Corporation, Chapter 78 of the NRS or other applicable law provides for a different proportion,

or series is required for any action of the stockholders by the NRS, the Articles of Incorporation or the Bylaws, in which case the number

a vote, consent, waiver or proxy appointment if the secretary or other officer or agent authorized to tabulate votes, acting in good
faith, has reasonable basis for doubt about the validity of the signature on it or about the signatory s authority to sign for
the stockholder. All decisions of the Corporation shall be valid and binding unless and until a court of competent jurisdiction determines
otherwise. 

2.8
 Proxies . Each stockholder entitled to vote at a meeting of stockholders may authorize, in a manner permitted by the NRS, another
person or persons to act for such stockholder by proxy. Every proxy shall continue in full force and effect until its expiration or revocation
in a manner permitted by the NRS. A proxy may be irrevocable if it states that it is irrevocable and, if, and only as long as, it is
coupled with an interest sufficient to support an irrevocable power. Subject to the above, any proxy may be revoked if an instrument
or transmission revoking it or a properly created proxy bearing a later date is filed with or transmitted to the Secretary or another
person appointed by the Corporation to count the votes of stockholders and determine the validity of proxies and ballots, or, in the
case of a meeting of stockholders, the stockholder revokes the proxy by attending the meeting and voting the stockholder s shares

as described above. To be in proper form, such stockholder s notice must:

and the extent to which any hedging or other transaction or series of transactions has been entered into by or on behalf of the nominee
with respect to any securities of the Corporation, and a description of any other agreement, arrangement or understanding (including

and in the manner permitted by law, to indemnify and to advance expenses to persons other than Covered Persons when and as authorized
