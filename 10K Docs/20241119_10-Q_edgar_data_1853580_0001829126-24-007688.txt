 NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

units (the Units and, with respect to the Class A ordinary shares included in the Units being offered, the Public Shares ), at per Unit, generating gross proceeds of million. 

The Company incurred offering costs in the Initial Public Offering totaling , consisting of of underwriting fees, of deferred underwriting fees, and of other offering costs (see Note 2). 

Simultaneously with the closing of the Initial Public Offering, the Company consummated the private placement Private Placement of warrants (each, a Private Placement Warrant and collectively, the Private Placement Warrants ), at a price of per Private Placement Warrant with the Initial Sponsor, generating gross proceeds of (see Note 4 and Note 8). 

Upon the closing of the Initial Public Offering and the Private Placement, an amount of million per Unit) from the net proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and certain of the proceeds of the Private Placement were placed in a trust account Trust Account with Continental Stock Transfer Trust Company acting as trustee and invested in United States government securities within the meaning of Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the Investment Company Act having a maturity of 185 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company Act which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations, as determined by the Company, until the earlier of: (i) the completion of a Business Combination and (ii) the distribution of the Trust Account as described below. 

On August 3, 2021, the underwriters notified the Company of their intention to partially exercise the over-allotment option on August 5, 2021 (the Over-Allotment ). As such, on August 5, 2021, the Company consummated the sale of an additional Units (the Over-Allotment Units ), at per Unit, and the sale of an additional Private Placement Warrants, at 1.50 per Private Placement Warrant, generating total gross proceeds of and , respectively. The underwriters forfeited the balance of the over-allotment option. A total of of the net proceeds was deposited into the Trust Account, bringing the aggregate proceeds held in the Trust Account to (see Note 2). The Company incurred additional offering costs of in connection with the Over-Allotment (of which was for deferred underwriting fees). 

The Company s management has broad discretion with respect to the specific application of the net proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants, although substantially all of the net proceeds, which are placed in the Trust Account, are intended to be applied generally toward consummating a Business Combination. The Company s initial Business Combination must be with one or more target businesses that together have a fair market value equal to at least of the balance held in the Trust Account (less any deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on interest earned on the Trust Account) at the time the Company signs a definitive agreement in connection with the initial Business Combination. However, the Company will only complete a Business Combination if the post-Business Combination company owns or acquires or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. 

The Company will provide its holders of the outstanding Public Shares (the Public Shareholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their Public Shares upon the completion of a Business Combination either (i) in connection with a shareholder meeting called to approve the Business Combination pursuant to the proxy solicitation rules of the SEC or (ii) by means of a tender offer. In connection with a proposed Business Combination, the Company will be required to seek shareholder approval of a Business Combination at a meeting called for such purpose at which shareholders may seek to redeem their shares, regardless of whether they vote for or against a Business Combination. The Company will proceed with a Business Combination only if the Company has net tangible assets of at least either immediately prior to or upon such consummation of a Business Combination and a majority of the outstanding shares voted are voted in favor of the Business Combination. 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company s amended and restated memorandum and articles of association (as amended, the Articles provide that, a Public Shareholder, together with any affiliate of such shareholder or any other person with whom such shareholder is acting in concert or as a group (as defined under Section 13 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )), will be restricted from seeking redemption rights with respect to 15 or more of the Public Shares without the Company s prior written consent. 

The Public Shareholders will be entitled to redeem their shares for a pro rata portion of the amount then in the Trust Account (initially 10.00 per share, plus any pro rata interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to the Company to pay its tax obligations). The per-share amount to be distributed to shareholders who redeem their shares will not be reduced by the deferred underwriting commissions the Company will pay to the underwriters. There will be no redemption rights upon the completion of a Business Combination with respect to the Company s warrants. These Public Shares are recorded at a redemption value and classified as temporary equity upon the completion of the Initial Public Offering, in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ASC Topic 480 Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity. 

If the Company is not required to conduct redemptions pursuant to the proxy solicitation rules as described above, the Company will, pursuant to its Articles, offer such redemption pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC, and file tender offer documents containing substantially the same information as would be included in a proxy statement with the SEC prior to completing a Business Combination. 

Pursuant to an amended and restated letter agreement dated July 21, 2023 (the Letter Agreement ), the Company s sponsors and current and former officers, directors and certain advisors have agreed (a) to vote their Founder Shares (as defined in Note 8) and any Public Shares purchased during or after the Initial Public Offering in favor of a Business Combination, (b) not to redeem any shares (including the Founder Shares) into the right to receive cash from the Trust Account in connection with a shareholder vote to approve a Business Combination or a vote to amend the provisions of the Articles relating to shareholders rights of pre-Business Combination activity and (c) that the Founder Shares shall not participate in any liquidating distributions upon winding up if a Business Combination is not consummated. However, the above-listed parties to the Letter Agreement will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to any Public Shares purchased during or after the Initial Public Offering if the Company fails to complete its Business Combination. 

On July 21, 2023, the Company held an extraordinary general meeting of shareholders (the First Extension Meeting ). At the First Extension Meeting, the Company s shareholders approved two proposals to amend the Company s amended and restated memorandum and articles of association (the Articles ). The first such proposal (the Extension Amendment and, such proposal, the Extension Amendment Proposal sought to amend the Articles to extend the date by which the Company must (1) consummate a Business Combination, (2) cease its operations except for the purpose of winding up if it fails to complete a Business Combination, and (3) redeem all of the Company s Class A ordinary shares sold in the Company s IPO, from 24 months from the closing of the IPO to 36 months from the closing of the IPO or such earlier date as is determined by our board of directors (the Board to be in the best interests of the Company. The second such proposal (the Redemption Limitation Amendment and such proposal, the Redemption Limitation Amendment Proposal sought to eliminate from the Articles the limitation that the Company shall not redeem Class A ordinary shares sold in the IPO to the extent that such redemption would cause the Company s net tangible assets to be less than . 

In connection with the vote to approve the Extension Amendment Proposal, effective as of July 21, 2023, holders of Class A ordinary shares exercised their right to redeem their shares for cash at a redemption price of approximately per share, for an aggregate redemption amount of approximately million. As a result, approximately million remained in the Company s trust account as of July 21, 2023 and Class A ordinary shares remained outstanding. 

On October 11, 2023, the Company held an extraordinary general meeting of shareholders (the Meeting at which shareholders approved changing the name of the Company from Portage Fintech Acquisition Corporation to Perception Capital Corp. III (the Name Change and the amendment and restatement of the Company s amended and restated memorandum and articles of association to reflect the Name Change (the Articles Amendment ). The Name Change and the Articles Amendment did not alter the voting powers or relative rights of the Company s ordinary shares. The Articles Amendment was filed with the Cayman Islands Registrar of Companies on October 11, 2023. 

On February 6, 2024, the Company entered into a business combination agreement (the Business Combination Agreement or BCA with RBio Energy Holdings Corp., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of PC3 NewPubco ), Perception RBio Merger Sub, a Cayman Islands exempted company and a wholly owned subsidiary of NewPubco Merger Sub ), and RBio Energy Corporation, a Delaware corporation RBio Energy ). 

On February 6, 2024, the Company received a notice (the Notice from the Listing Qualifications Department of Nasdaq stating that the Company had failed to hold an annual meeting of shareholders within 12 months after our fiscal year end, as required by Nasdaq Listing Rule 5620(a) (the Annual Shareholders Meeting Rule and therefore was not in compliance with the Annual Shareholders Meeting Rule. The Notice stated that the Company had 45 calendar days, or until March 25, 2024, to submit a plan to regain compliance with the Annual Shareholders Meeting Rule. On March 19, 2024, the Company submitted to Nasdaq a plan to regain compliance with the Annual Shareholders Meeting Rule within the required timeframe. On April 15, 2024, Nasdaq accepted the Company s plan and granted the Company an extension until June 30, 2024 to regain compliance with the Annual Shareholders Meeting Rule. 

On June 28, 2024, the Company held its second extraordinary general meeting in lieu of annual meeting of shareholders (the Second Extension Meeting at which its shareholders approved a proposal to amend the Articles to extend the date by which the Company has to consummate a business combination from July 23, 2024 to April 23, 2025, or such earlier date as may be determined by the Company s board of directors to be in the best interests of the Company (the Second Extension Amendment and such later date, the Extended Date ). 

In connection with the votes to approve the proposal above, the holders of Class A Ordinary Shares of the Company properly exercised their right to redeem their shares for cash at a redemption price of approximately per share, for an aggregate redemption amount of approximately million, leaving approximately million in the trust account. 

In connection with the implementation of the Second Extension Amendment, the Sponsor and PFTA 1 LP, the former sponsor, converted an aggregate of Class B Ordinary Shares into Class A Ordinary Shares (the Class B Conversion ). 

As a result of holding its extraordinary general meeting in lieu of annual meeting on June 28, 2024 within Nasdaq s extended timeframe, the Company regained compliance with the Annual Shareholders Meeting Rule. 

On July 23, 2024, the Company received a notice from the staff of the Listing Qualifications Department of Nasdaq indicating that unless the Company timely requests a hearing before the Nasdaq Hearings Panel (the Panel ), trading of the Company s securities on Nasdaq would be suspended at the opening of business on August 1, 2024, due to the Company s non-compliance with Nasdaq IM-5101-2, which requires that a special purpose acquisition company complete one or more business combinations within 36 months of the effectiveness of its registration statement in connection with its initial public offering. 

The Company timely requested a hearing before the Panel to request sufficient time to complete its previously disclosed proposed business combination with RBio Energy Corporation RBio ). The hearing request resulted in a stay of any suspension or delisting action pending the hearing, which was held on August 29, 2024. On September 17, 2024, the Company received a letter from Nasdaq indicating that the Panel granted the Company s request for an exception to Nasdaq s listing rules to allow the Company to complete its business combination with RBio on or before December 2, 2024. We will not be able to complete our business combination on or before December 2, 2024. 

There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to maintain compliance with other Nasdaq listing requirements. 

On August 26, 2024, the Company received written notice (the Late Filing Notice from Nasdaq indicating that the Company was delinquent in filing its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended June 30, 2024 (the Second Quarter Form 10-Q ), which may have served as an additional basis for the delisting of the Company s securities from Nasdaq. As a result, the Company was not in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5250(c)(1), which requires listed companies to timely file all required periodic financial reports with the SEC. On August 29, 2024, the Company filed the Second Quarter Form 10-Q with the SEC, therefore, curing the deficiency outlined in the Late Filing Notice. 

If the Company is unable to complete a Business Combination by April 23, 2025 (the Combination Period ), the Company will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but no more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the Public Shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to the Company to pay taxes (less up to of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding Public Shares, which redemption will completely extinguish Public Shareholders rights as shareholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of the remaining shareholders and the Company s board of directors, proceed to commence a voluntary liquidation and thereby a formal dissolution of the Company, subject in each case to the requirements of applicable law, including any obligations to provide for claims of creditors. The underwriters have agreed to waive their rights to the deferred underwriting commission held in the Trust Account in the event the Company does not complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period, and, in such event, such amounts will be included with the funds held in the Trust Account that will be available to fund the redemption of the Public Shares. In the event of such distribution, it is possible that the per share value of the assets remaining available for distribution will be less than the Initial Public Offering price per Unit 10.00. 

Pursuant to the Letter Agreement, the Managing Sponsor has agreed that it will be liable to the Company if and to the extent any claims by a third party for services rendered or products sold to the Company, or a prospective target business with which the Company has discussed entering into a transaction agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the Trust Account to below the lesser of (i) 10.00 per Public Share and (ii) the actual amount per Public Share held in the Trust Account as of the date of liquidation of the Trust Account, if less than 10.00 per share due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, less taxes payable, provided that such liability will not apply to any claims by a third party or prospective target business who executed a waiver of any and all rights to monies held in the Trust Account (whether or not such waiver is enforceable) nor will it apply to any claims under the Company s indemnity of the underwriters of the Initial Public Offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ). However, the Company has not asked the Managing Sponsor to reserve for such indemnification obligations, nor has the Company independently verified whether the Managing Sponsor has sufficient funds to satisfy its indemnity obligations and believe that the Managing Sponsor s only assets are securities of the Company. Therefore, the Company cannot assure its shareholders that the Managing Sponsor would be able to satisfy those obligations. Neither the Initial Sponsor nor any of the Company s officers or directors will indemnify the Company for claims by third parties including, without limitation, claims by vendors and prospective target businesses. The Company will seek to reduce the possibility that the Managing Sponsor will have to indemnify the Trust Account due to claims of creditors by endeavoring to have all vendors, service providers, prospective target businesses or other entities with which the Company does business, execute agreements with the Company waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the Trust Account.

the Company had 
 in its operating bank account and working capital deficit of . 

The Company has principally financed its operations from inception using proceeds from the sale of its equity securities to its shareholders prior to the Initial Public Offering and such amount of proceeds from the Private Placement that were placed in an account outside of the Trust Account for working capital purposes. Until the consummation of a Business Combination, the Company will be using the funds not held in the Trust Account for identifying and evaluating prospective acquisition candidates, performing due diligence on prospective target businesses, paying for travel expenditures, selecting the target business to acquire, and structuring, negotiating and consummating the Business Combination. 

The Company may need to raise additional capital through loans or additional investments from its sponsors, shareholders, officers, directors, or third parties. The Company s officers, directors and sponsors may, but are not obligated to (other than as described above), loan the Company funds, from time to time or at any time, in whatever amount they deem reasonable in their sole discretion, to meet the Company s working capital needs. Accordingly, the Company may not be able to obtain additional financing. If the Company is unable to raise additional capital, it may be required to take additional measures to conserve liquidity, which could include, but not necessarily be limited to, curtailing operations, suspending the pursuit of a potential transaction, and reducing overhead expenses. The Company cannot provide any assurance that new financing will be available to it on commercially acceptable terms, if at all. 

In connection with the Company s assessment of going concern considerations in accordance with Financial Accounting Standard Board s FASB ASC Subtopic 205-40, Presentation of Financial Statements - Going Concern, the Company has until April 23, 2025 to consummate a Business Combination. It is uncertain whether the Company will be able to consummate a Business Combination by this time. If a Business Combination is not consummated by this date, there will be a mandatory liquidation and subsequent dissolution of the Company. Management has determined that the liquidity condition and mandatory liquidation, should a Business Combination not occur, raises substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern through approximately one year from the date these unaudited financial statements were issued. Management intends to consummate a Business Combination prior to April 23, 2025. These unaudited financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recovery of the recorded assets or the classification of the liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. 

Risks and Uncertainties 

Management continues to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the industry and has concluded that while it is reasonably possible that the virus could have a negative effect on the Company s financial position, results of its operations and/or search for a target company, the specific impact is not readily determinable as of the date of these financial statements. These financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

Various social and political circumstances in the U.S. and around the world (including wars and other forms of conflict, including rising trade tensions between the United States and China, and other uncertainties regarding actual and potential shifts in the U.S. and foreign, trade, economic and other policies with other countries, terrorist acts, security operations and catastrophic events such as fires, floods, earthquakes, tornadoes, hurricanes and global health epidemics), may also contribute to increased market volatility and economic uncertainties or deterioration in the U.S. and worldwide. Specifically, the rising conflict in the Middle East and between Russia and Ukraine, and resulting market volatilities could adversely affect the Company s ability to complete a Business Combination. In response to the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, the U.S. and other countries have imposed sanctions or other restrictive actions against Russia. Any of the above factors, including sanctions, export controls, tariffs, trade wars and other governmental actions, could have a material adverse effect on the Company s ability to complete a Business Combination and the value of the Company s securities. 

Further, Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies (that is, those that have not had a Securities Act registration statement declared effective or do not have a class of securities registered under the Exchange Act) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standards. The JOBS Act provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such election to opt out is irrevocable. The Company has elected not to opt out of such extended transition period, which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies, the Company, as an emerging growth company, can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard. This may make comparison of the Company s financial statements with another public company, which is neither an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company which has opted out of using the extended transition period difficult or impossible because of the potential differences in accounting standards used.

There is currently no taxation imposed on income by the Government of the Cayman Islands. In accordance with Cayman Islands income tax regulations, income taxes are not levied on the Company. Consequently, income taxes are not reflected in the Company s financial statements. The Company s management does not expect that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits will materially change over the next twelve months. In accordance with federal income tax regulations, income taxes are not levied on the Company, but rather on the individual owners. United States U.S. taxation would occur on the individual owners if certain tax elections are made by U.S. owners and the Company were treated as a passive foreign investment company. Additionally, U.S. taxation could occur to the Company itself if the Company is engaged in a U.S. trade or business. The Company is not expected to be treated as engaged in a U.S. trade or business at this time.

The Company applies ASC 820, which establishes a framework for measuring fair value and clarifies the definition of fair value within that framework. ASC 820 defines fair value as an exit price, which is the price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the Company s principal or most advantageous market in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. The fair value hierarchy established in ASC 820 generally requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. Observable inputs reflect the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability and are developed based on market data obtained from sources independent of the reporting entity. Unobservable inputs reflect the entity s own assumptions based on market data and the entity s judgments about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability and are to be developed based on the best information available in the circumstances. 

Level 1 Assets and liabilities with unadjusted, quoted prices listed on active market exchanges. Inputs to the fair value measurement are observable inputs, such as quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. 

Level 2 Inputs to the fair value measurement are determined using prices for recently traded assets and liabilities with similar underlying terms, as well as direct or indirect observable inputs, such as interest rates and yield curves that are observable at commonly quoted intervals. 

Level 3 Inputs to the fair value measurement are unobservable inputs, such as estimates, assumptions, and valuation techniques when little or no market data exists for the assets or liabilities.

In the case that additional Class A ordinary shares, or equity linked securities, are issued or deemed issued in excess of the amounts offered in the Initial Public Offering and related to the closing of a Business Combination, the ratio at which Class B ordinary shares shall convert into Class A ordinary shares will be adjusted (unless the holders of a majority of the outstanding Class B ordinary shares agree to waive such adjustment with respect to any such issuance or deemed issuance) so that the number of Class A ordinary shares issuable upon conversion of all Class B ordinary shares will equal, in the aggregate, on an as converted basis, 20 of the sum of the total number of all ordinary shares outstanding upon the completion of the Initial Public Offering plus all Class A ordinary shares and equity linked securities issued or deemed issued in connection with a Business Combination (excluding any shares or equity linked securities issued, or to be issued, to any seller in a Business Combination, and any private placement-equivalent warrants issued to the Initial Sponsor or its affiliates upon conversion of loans made to the Company). Holders of Founder Shares may also elect to convert their Class B ordinary shares into an equal number of Class A ordinary shares, subject to adjustment as provided above, at any time. 

The Company may issue additional ordinary shares or preference shares to complete its Business Combination or under an employee incentive plan after completion of its Business Combination. 

warrants issued in connection with the Initial Public Offering Public Warrants and Private Placement Warrants) in accordance with the guidance contained in ASC 815-40. Such guidance provides that because the warrants do not meet the criteria for equity treatment thereunder, each warrant must be recorded as a liability. Accordingly, the Company has classified each warrant as a liability at its fair value. This liability is subject to re-measurement at each balance sheet date. With each such re-measurement, the warrant liability will be adjusted to fair value, with the change in fair value recognized in the Company s statements of operations. 

Public Warrants may only be exercised for a whole number of shares. No fractional shares will be issued upon exercise of the Public Warrants. The Public Warrants will become exercisable 30 days after the consummation of a Business Combination. The Public Warrants will expire five years from the consummation of a Business Combination or earlier upon redemption or liquidation. 

The Company will not be obligated to deliver any Class A ordinary shares pursuant to the exercise of a Public Warrant and will have no obligation to settle such Public Warrant exercise unless a registration statement under the Securities Act covering the issuance of the Class A ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the Public Warrants is then effective and a prospectus relating thereto is current, subject to the Company satisfying its obligations with respect to registration. No Public Warrant will be exercisable for cash or on a cashless basis, and the Company will not be obligated to issue any shares to holders seeking to exercise their Public Warrants, unless the issuance of the shares upon such exercise is registered or qualified under the securities laws of the state of the exercising holder, or an exemption from registration is available. 

The Company has agreed that as soon as practicable, but in no event later than 20 business days, after the closing of a Business Combination, it will use its commercially reasonable efforts to file with the SEC a post-effective amendment to the registration statement for the Initial Public Offering or a new registration statement covering the Class A ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the Public Warrants. The Company will use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the same to become effective within 60 business days after the closing of a Business Combination, and to maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement and a current prospectus relating to those Class A ordinary shares until the warrants expire or are redeemed, as specified in the warrant agreement. If a post-effective amendment or a new registration statement covering the Class A ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants is not effective by the 60 th business day after the closing of a Business Combination, warrant holders may, until such time as there is an effective registration statement and during any period when the Company will have failed to maintain an effective registration statement, exercise warrants on a cashless basis in accordance with Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act or another exemption. 

Redemption of warrants when the price per Class A ordinary share equals or exceeds . Once the warrants become exercisable, the Company may redeem the Warrants for redemption: 

in whole and not in part; 

at a price of per Public Warrant; 

upon not less than 30 days prior written notice of redemption to each warrant holder; and 

if, and only if, the reported last sale price of the Class A ordinary shares equals or exceeds 18.00 per share (as adjusted for share splits, share dividends, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like) for any 20 trading days within a 30-trading day period ending three business days before the Company sends the notice of redemption to the warrant holders. 

The Company will not redeem the warrants as described above unless an effective registration statement under the Securities Act covering the issuance of the Class A ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants is then effective and a current prospectus relating to those Class A ordinary shares is available throughout the 30-day redemption period. If and when the warrants become redeemable by the Company, the Company may exercise its redemption right even if the Company is unable to register or qualify the underlying securities for sale under all applicable state securities laws. 

Redemption of warrants when the price per Class A ordinary share equals or exceeds 10.00 . Once the Warrants become exercisable, the Company may redeem the Warrants for redemption: 

in whole and not in part; 

at a price of 0.10 per warrant upon a minimum of 30 days prior written notice of redemption provided that holders will be able to exercise their warrants on a cashless basis prior to redemption and receive that number of shares determined by reference to an agreed table based on the redemption date and the fair market value of Class A ordinary shares; 

if, and only if, the closing price of Class A ordinary shares equals or exceeds 10.00 per share (as adjusted share splits, share dividends, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like) for any 20 trading days within the 30-trading day period ending three trading days before the Company sends a notice of redemption to the warrant holders; and 

if the closing price of Class A ordinary shares for any 20 trading days within a 30-trading day period ending on the third trading day prior to the date on which we send the notice of redemption to the warrant holders is less than 18.00 per share (as adjusted share splits, share dividends, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like), the Private Placement Warrants must also be concurrently called for redemption on the same terms as the outstanding Public Warrants, as described above. 

If and when the Public Warrants become redeemable by the Company, the Company may not exercise its redemption right if the issuance of Class A ordinary shares upon exercise of the warrants is not exempt from registration or qualification under applicable state blue sky laws or the Company is unable to effect such registration or qualification. 

The exercise price and number of Class A ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants may be adjusted in certain circumstances including in the event of a share dividend, or recapitalization, reorganization, merger or consolidation. Additionally, in no event will the Company be required to net cash settle the Public Warrants. If the Company is unable to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period and the Company liquidates the funds held in the Trust Account, holders of warrants will not receive any of such funds with respect to their warrants, nor will they receive any distribution from the Company s assets held outside of the Trust Account with the respect to such warrants. Accordingly, the warrants may expire worthless. If the Company calls the Public Warrants for redemption, management will have the option to require all holders that wish to exercise the Public Warrants to do so on a cashless basis, as described in the warrant agreement. The exercise price and number of Class A ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the Public Warrants may be adjusted in certain circumstances including in the event of a share dividend, extraordinary dividend or recapitalization, reorganization, merger or consolidation. If the Company is unable to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period and the Company liquidates the funds held in the Trust Account, holders of warrants will not receive any of such funds with respect to their warrants, nor will they receive any distribution from the Company s assets held outside of the Trust Account with respect to such warrants. Accordingly, the warrants may expire worthless. 

In addition, if (x) the Company issues additional Class A ordinary shares or equity-linked securities for capital raising purposes in connection with the closing of its initial Business Combination at an issue price or effective issue price of less than 9.20 per Class A ordinary share (with such issue price or effective issue price to be determined in good faith by the Company s board of directors and, in the case of any such issuance to the sponsors or their affiliates, without taking into account any Founder Shares held by a sponsor or such affiliates, as applicable, prior to such issuance) (the Newly Issued Price ), (y) the aggregate gross proceeds from such issuances represent more than 60 of the total equity proceeds, and interest thereon, available for the funding of the Company s initial Business Combination on the date of the consummation of such initial Business Combination (net of redemptions), and (z) the volume weighted average trading price of the Company s Class A ordinary shares during the 20 trading day period starting on the trading day prior to the day on which the Company consummates its initial Business Combination (such price, the Market Value is below 9.20 per share, the exercise price of the warrants will be adjusted (to the nearest cent) to be equal to 115 of the higher of the Market Value and the Newly Issued Price and the 18.00 per share redemption trigger price described above will be adjusted (to the nearest cent) to be equal to 180 of the greater of the Market Value and the Newly Issued Price. 

The Private Placement Warrants are identical to the Public Warrants included in the Units sold in the Initial Public Offering, except that the Private Placement Warrants and the Class A ordinary shares issuable upon the exercise of the Private Placement Warrants will not be transferable, assignable or salable until 30 days after the completion of a Business Combination, subject to certain limited exceptions. Additionally, the Private Placement Warrants will be exercisable on a cashless basis and will be non-redeemable so long as they are held by the initial purchasers or their permitted transferees. If the Private Placement Warrants are held by someone other than the initial purchasers or their permitted transferees, the Private Placement Warrants will be redeemable by the Company and exercisable by such holders on the same basis as the Public Warrants. 

The following table presents information about the Company s assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, and indicates the fair value hierarchy of the valuation inputs the Company utilized to determine such fair value: 

Public Warrants (1) 
 
 2 

(1) 

Warrants 

The Warrants are accounted for as liabilities in accordance with ASC 815-40 and are presented within warrant liabilities on the balance sheets. The warrant liabilities are measured at fair value at inception and on a recurring basis, with changes in fair value presented within change in fair value of warrant liabilities in the statements of operations. 

Subsequent Measurement 

The Private Placement Warrants and the Public Warrants were initially valued using a Monte Carlo simulation model, which is considered to be a Level 3 fair value measurement. Inherent in an options pricing model are assumptions related to expected stock-price volatility, expected life, risk-free interest rate and dividend yield. The Company estimates the volatility of its ordinary shares based on historical volatility that matches the expected remaining life of the warrants. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury zero-coupon yield curve on the grant date for a maturity similar to the expected remaining life of the warrants. The expected life of the warrants is assumed to be equivalent to their remaining contractual term. The dividend rate is based on the historical rate, which the Company anticipates will remain at zero. The Monte Carlo simulation model was used for estimating the fair value of Public Warrants for periods where no observable traded price was available, using the same expected volatility as was used in measuring the fair value of the Private Placement Warrants. The subsequent measurements of the Public Warrants after the detachment of the Public Warrants from the Units is classified as Level 2 due to the use of an observable market quote in an active market for a similar asset in an active market. For periods subsequent to the detachment of the warrants from the Units, the close price of the Public Warrant price was used as the fair value as of each relevant date. The subsequent measurements of the Private Placement Warrants after the detachment of the Public Warrants from the Units are classified as Level 2 due to the use of an observable market quote for a similar asset in an active market. 

The key inputs into the Monte Carlo simulation model for the Private Placement Warrants and the Public Warrants were as follows:

As of September 30, 2024, we had cash held in the Trust Account of 17,853,173. We intend to use the funds held in the Trust Account, including any amounts representing interest earned on the Trust Account (less taxes payable), to complete our Business Combination. To the extent that our share capital or debt is used, in whole or in part, as consideration to complete our Business Combination, the remaining proceeds held in the Trust Account will be used as working capital to finance the operations of the target business or businesses, make other acquisitions and pursue our growth strategies. In connection with the vote to approve the Extension Amendment Proposal, holders Class A ordinary shares exercised their right to redeem their shares an aggregate redemption amount of approximately 229.1 million in cash. As a result, approximately 40.7 million remained in the Trust Account after the completion of those redemptions on July 21, 2023. 

As of September 30, 2024, we had operating cash of 33,474. We intend to use the funds held outside the Trust Account primarily to identify and evaluate target businesses, perform business due diligence on prospective target businesses, travel to and from the offices, plants or similar locations of prospective target businesses or their representatives or owners, review corporate documents and material agreements of prospective target businesses, and structure, negotiate and complete a Business Combination. 

31 

In order to fund any working capital deficiencies or finance transaction costs in connection with a Business Combination, the sponsors, or certain of our officers and directors or their affiliates may, but are not obligated to, loan us funds as may be required. If we complete a Business Combination, we would repay such loaned amounts. In the event that a Business Combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held outside the Trust Account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our Trust Account would be used for such repayment. Up to 1,500,000 of such loans Working Capital Loans may be convertible into warrants upon consummation of the Business Combination at a price of 1.50 per warrant. The warrants would be identical to the Private Placement Warrants. There are no Working Capital Loans outstanding. On April 5, 2023, the Company issued a promissory note (the Promissory Note to the Initial Sponsor, pursuant to which the Company may borrow up to 1,250,000 from the Initial Sponsor to fund the Company s working capital expenses prior to completion of any potential initial Business Combination. Also on April 5, 2023, the Company made a draw on the Promissory Note of 1,250,000. The Promissory Note was non-interest bearing and payable on the earlier of July 23, 2023 and the date on which the Company consummates a Business Combination. On July 21, 2023, the Initial Sponsor cancelled and forgave the outstanding balance on the Promissory Note of 1,250,000 in connection with the closing under the Purchase Agreement. 

On August 1, 2023, we entered into a Subscription Agreement with Investor and the Sponsor, pursuant to which the parties agreed, among other things, that: (i) the Investor will make a cash contribution to Sponsor in an aggregate amount of 1,300,000 (the Investor Capital Contribution as follows: (i) an initial tranche of 650,000, to be paid within five business days of the date of the Subscription Agreement, (ii) a second tranche of up to 325,000, to be paid following the Company s announcement of executing an agreement for the Company s initial business combination, and (iii) a third tranche of up to 325,000, to be paid after the Company files an initial registration statement with the SEC related to initial business combination. At the request of the Sponsor, the Investor may agree, in its sole discretion, to fund up to an additional 200,000 at any time; (ii) the Investor Capital Contribution will in turn be loaned by the Sponsor to the Company to cover working capital expenses (the SPAC Loan ). The SPAC Loan will not accrue interest and will be repaid by the Company upon the closing of the Company s initial business combination. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Subscription Agreement liability is 1,025,000 and 650,000 and included on the balance sheets, respectively. 

Going Concern 

In connection with the Company s assessment of going concern considerations in accordance with Financial Accounting Standard Board s FASB ASC Subtopic 205-40, Presentation of Financial Statements - Going Concern, the Company has until April 23, 2025 to consummate a Business Combination. It is uncertain whether the Company will be able to consummate a Business Combination by this time. If a Business Combination is not consummated by this date, there will be a mandatory liquidation and subsequent dissolution of the Company. Management has determined that the liquidity conditions and mandatory liquidation, should a Business Combination not occur, raises substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern through approximately one year from the date these financial statements were issued. Management intends to consummate a Business Combination prior to April 23, 2025. These financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recovery of the recorded assets or the classification of the liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. 

Contractual Obligations 

Pursuant to an administrative services agreement, we had agreed to pay the Initial Sponsor a total of 10,000 per month for office space, utilities, secretarial and administrative support services provided to members of our management team. Upon completion of the initial Business Combination or our liquidation, we would have ceased paying those monthly fees. In addition, until completion of our Business Combination or liquidation, we were required to reimburse the Initial Sponsor or its affiliates monthly for compensation expenses of employees dedicated to us (including the Chief Financial Officer) not to exceed 900,000 per year. We recognized 0 for administrative support services and approximately and 0 for reimbursement of compensation expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. We recognized approximately 10,000 and 70,000 for administrative support services and approximately 47,000 and 444,000 for reimbursement of compensation expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. The administrative services agreement was terminated in connection with the closing under the Purchase Agreement on July 21, 2023. 

32 

The holders of Founder Shares, Private Placement Warrants, and securities that may be issued upon conversion of Working Capital Loans, if any, are entitled to registration rights pursuant to a registration rights agreement. These holders will be entitled to make up to three demands, excluding short form demands, that we register such securities. In addition, these holders will have certain piggy-back registration rights with respect to registration statements filed subsequent to the completion of the initial Business Combination. We will bear the expenses incurred in connection with the filing of any such registration statements. 

The underwriters are entitled to a deferred fee of three and half percent (3.50 of the gross proceeds of the Initial Public Offering, or 9,068,983. On August 15, 2022, one of the underwriters, Goldman Sachs Co. LLC Goldman Sachs ), waived its entitlement to the payment of any deferred fee to be paid under the terms of the underwriting agreement and is no longer serving in an advisor capacity. As a result of Goldman Sachs waiving all of its 6,529,668 of deferred underwriting fees, the deferred underwriting fee payable was 2,539,315 as of December 31, 2022. In June of 2023, the remaining underwriters waived their entitlement to the payment of any deferred fee to be paid under the terms of the underwriting agreement and is no longer serving in an advisor capacity. As a result, the Company recognized 352,969 of income and 2,186,346 was recorded to additional paid-in capital in relation to the reduction of the deferred underwriter fee. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the deferred underwriting fee payable was 0. 

On July 17, 2023, the Company entered into an engagement letter with J.V.B Financial Group, acting through its Cohen Company Capital Markets division CCM to obtain capital markets advisory services in connection with seeking an extension for completing a business combination, capital market advisory services in connection with a possible business combination transaction with an unaffiliated third party (the Target and to act as the Company s placement agent in connection with raising capital. CCM would be entitled to an advisor fee of 2.0 million and a transaction fee of an amount equal to 5 of the sum of the gross proceeds raised from investors and received by the Company or Target plus proceeds released from the Trust Account with respect to any of the Class A ordinary shares that did not redeem such shares in connection with the extension or the business combination. If the gross proceeds raised from investors is 3,000,000 or less, the Company may elect to pay the portion of the fee related to the offering in the form of an equivalent dollar amount of Class A ordinary shares or equivalent equity of the post-business combination company, which shares shall be delivered four (4) business days following the closing of the sale transaction as determined by the Company. The shares, if issued, shall be duly authorized, validly issued, paid and non-assessable and shall be registered for resale under the Act, or otherwise freely tradeable, as of the delivery of the shares and will be delivered in book entry form in the name of and delivered to CCM (or its designee) four (4) business days following the closing of the transaction. In addition, up to 50 of the advisor fee may be paid in shares as described above in the case of gross proceeds raised from investors. Pursuant to the engagement letter, the advisor fee cannot be less than 1,000,000. 

Critical Accounting Estimates 

The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and income and expenses during the period reported. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates. We have identified the following critical accounting policies: 

Warrant Liabilities 

We evaluated the Public Warrants and the Private Placement Warrants in accordance with ASC 815-40, Derivatives and Hedging Contracts in Entity s Own Equity and concluded that a provision in the warrant agreement related to certain tender or exchange offers precludes the Warrants from being accounted for as components of equity. As the Warrants meet the definition of a derivative as contemplated in ASC 815, the Warrants are recorded as derivative liabilities on the balance sheets and measured at fair value at inception (on the date of the Initial Public Offering) and at each reporting date in accordance with ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement , with changes in fair value recognized in the statements of operations in the period of change.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 

Not required for smaller reporting companies. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 

Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial and accounting officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period ended September 30, 2024, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act. 

Disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that during the period covered by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2024, because of a material weakness in internal controls related to the accounting of complex financial instruments. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

Other than the identified material weakness and steps taken to remediate the material weakness, there was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the period ended September 30, 2024, covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings 

None. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors 

As of the date of this Report there have been no material changes to the risk factors disclosed in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on April 16, 2024, other than as discussed below: 

The Second Extension Amendment contravenes Nasdaq rules and, as a result, may lead Nasdaq to suspend trading in our securities or lead our securities to be delisted from Nasdaq. If our securities are delisted from Nasdaq, our Class A ordinary shares would be deemed a penny stock and we may become subject to the requirements of Rule 419 to which we are not currently subject. 

Our Class A ordinary shares, units and public warrants are listed on Nasdaq. Nasdaq IM-5101-2 requires that a special purpose acquisition company complete one or more business combinations within 36 months of the effectiveness of its registration statement for its initial public offering, which, in the case of PC3, was July 23, 2024 (the Nasdaq Deadline ). On June 28, 2024, our shareholders approved the Second Extension Amendment which allows us to extend the termination date to up April 23, 2025, or such earlier date as may be determined by our board of directors to be in the best interests of the Company, which is beyond the Nasdaq Deadline. As a result, the Second Extension Amendment does not comply with Nasdaq rules. On July 23, 2024, we received a notice from the staff of the Listing Qualifications Department of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC indicating that, unless we timely requested a hearing before the Panel, our securities would be subject to suspension and delisting from Nasdaq at the opening of business on August 1, 2024, due to our non-compliance with Nasdaq IM-5101-2. We timely requested a hearing before the Panel. The hearing request resulted in a stay of any suspension or delisting action pending the hearing, which was held on August 29, 2024. On September 17, 2024, we received a letter from Nasdaq indicating that the Panel granted our request for an exception to Nasdaq s listing rules to allow us to complete our business combination with RBio on or before December 2, 2024. We will not be able to complete our business combination on or before December 2, 2024. 

In addition, we are subject to compliance with Nasdaq s continued listing requirements in order to maintain the listing of our securities on Nasdaq. Such continued listing requirements for our Class A ordinary shares include, among other things, the requirement to maintain at least 300 public holders. 

We
expect that if our Class A ordinary shares fail to meet Nasdaq s continued listing requirements, our units and public warrants
will also fail to meet Nasdaq s continued listing requirements for those securities. If our securities do not meet
Nasdaq s continued listing requirements, Nasdaq will delist our securities from trading on its exchange. If our securities are
delisted from Nasdaq, our Class A ordinary shares would become subject to the regulations of the SEC relating to the market for
 penny stocks. Under Rule 419 of the Securities Act, the term blank check company means a company that
(i) is a development stage company that has no specific business plan or purpose or has indicated that its business plan is to
engage in a merger or acquisition with an unidentified company or companies, or other entity or person; and (ii) is issuing
 penny stock, as defined in Rule 3a51-1 under the Exchange Act. Under Rule 3a51-1, the term penny
stock means any equity security, unless it fits within certain enumerated exclusions including being listed on a national
securities exchange, such as Nasdaq (Rule 3a51-1(a)(2)) (the Exchange Rule ). We currently rely on the Exchange Rule to
not be deemed a penny stock issuer (and consequently a blank check company under Rule 419). If we are deemed a
 blank check company as defined under Rule 419, we will become subject to additional restrictions on the trading of our
securities. Among those restrictions is that brokers trading in the securities of a blank check company under Rule 419 adhere to
more stringent rules, including being subject to the depository requirements of Rule 419. 

The penny stock rules are burdensome and may reduce the trading activity for our Class A ordinary shares. If our Class A ordinary shares are subject to the penny stock rules, the holders of such Class A ordinary shares may find it more difficult to sell their shares. 

35 

If Nasdaq delists any of our securities from trading on its exchange and we are not able to list such securities on another national securities exchange, we expect such securities would be quoted on an over-the-counter market. If this were to occur, we and our shareholders could face significant material adverse consequences, including: 

a limited availability of market quotations for our securities, which may limit your ability to determine the price of our securities in a timely manner; 

reduced liquidity for our securities, which may impact your ability to sell our securities; 

as discussed above, a determination that our Class A ordinary shares is a penny stock which will require brokers trading in our Class A ordinary shares to adhere to more stringent rules, including being subject to the depository requirements of Rule 419 of the Securities Act, and possibly resulting in a reduced level of trading activity in the secondary trading market for our Class A ordinary shares; and 

a decreased ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future, which may adversely impact our efforts to consummate a Business Combination and otherwise continue our operations. 

The National Securities Markets Improvement Act of 1996, which is a federal statute, prevents or preempts the states from regulating the sale of certain securities, which are referred to as covered securities. Since our Class A ordinary shares, units and public warrants are listed on Nasdaq, such securities qualify as covered securities under such statute. Although the states are preempted from regulating the sale of covered securities, the federal statute does allow the states to investigate companies if there is a suspicion of fraud, and, if there is a finding of fraudulent activity, then the states can regulate or bar the sale of covered securities in a particular case. While we are not aware of a state having used these powers to prohibit or restrict the sale of securities issued by blank check companies, other than the State of Idaho, certain state securities regulators view blank check companies unfavorably and might use these powers, or threaten to use these powers, to hinder the sale of securities of blank check companies in their states. Further, if our Class A ordinary shares, units and public warrants were no longer listed on Nasdaq, these securities would not qualify as covered securities under such statute and we would be subject to regulation in each state in which we offers our securities. 

Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities, Use of Proceeds, and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities 

On July 23, 2021, we consummated our initial public offering of 24,000,000 units, at 10.00 per unit, generating gross proceeds of 240.0 million. We granted the underwriter a 45-day option to purchase up to an additional 3,600,000 units to cover over-allotments. On August 5, 2021, the underwriters partially exercised the over-allotment option to purchase an additional 1,911,379 units generating gross proceeds of approximately 19.1 million. The underwriters forfeited the balance of the option. The securities sold in the initial public offering were registered under the Securities Act on registration statements on Form S-1 (Nos. 333-257185 and 333- 258062). The registration statement was declared effective on July 20, 2021.
