million and million, respectively, nearly all of which were finished goods. 

million in cash, subject to a dollar-for-dollar adjustment to the extent that the working capital at closing was greater or less than the target working capital of approximately million. The Acquisition was funded by the Company using the proceeds of an million term loan from The CIT Group/Commercial Services, Inc. CIT and additional borrowings under the Company s revolving line of credit with CIT. 
 
 The Acquisition has been accounted for in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 805, Business Combinations . The Company is currently determining the allocation of the acquisition cost with the assistance of an independent third party. The identifiable assets acquired were recorded at their estimated fair value, which has been preliminarily determined based on available information and the use of multiple valuation approaches. The estimated useful lives of the identifiable intangible assets acquired were determined based upon the remaining time that these assets are expected to directly or indirectly contribute to the future cash flow of the Company. Certain data necessary to complete the acquisition cost allocation is not yet available, including the final appraisals and valuations of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. 

The acquisition cost paid on the Closing Date amounted to million, which included an estimate for the net working capital adjustment. The following table represents the Company s preliminary allocation of the acquisition cost (in thousands) to the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed based on their respective estimated fair values as of the Closing Date. The excess of the acquisition cost over the estimated fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired is reflected as goodwill.

 Net acquisition cost 

The Company expects to complete the acquisition cost allocation during the 12 -month period following the Closing Date, during which time the values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including the goodwill, may need to be revised as appropriate. 
 
 Based upon the preliminary allocation of the acquisition cost, the Company recognized million of goodwill as of the Closing Date, the entirety of which was assigned to the reporting unit of the Company that produces and markets infant and toddler bedding and diaper bags, and the entirety of which is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes. The goodwill recognized primarily consists of synergies expected from combining operations of Baby Boom and the Company and intangible assets acquired that do not qualify for separate recognition. 
 
 The assets acquired in the Acquisition generated net sales of million of bedding and diaper bag products for the three -month period ended September 29, 2024. Amortization expense associated with the acquired amortizable intangible assets was during the three and six months ended September 29, 2024, respectively, which is included in marketing and administrative expenses in the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated statements of income. Amortization is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which are years for the tradename, years for the customer and licensing relationships and years on a weighted-average basis for the grouping taken together. 
 
 The Company has determined, on a pro forma basis, that the combined net sales and the combined net income of the Company and Baby Boom, giving effect to the Acquisition as if it had been completed on April 3, 2023, would have been million and million, respectively, for the three -month period ended September 29, 2024, and would have been million and million, respectively, for the six -month period ended September 29, 2024. The combined net sales and the combined net income would have been million and million, respectively, for the three -month period ended October 1, 2023, and would have been million and million, respectively, for the six -month period ended October 1, 2023. The combined net income includes adjustments related to the amortization of the amortizable intangible assets acquired and estimates of the interest expense and income tax expense or benefit that would have been incurred, but otherwise do not reflect the costs of any integration activities or benefits that may result from the realization of future cost savings from operating efficiencies, or any revenue, tax or other synergies that may result from the Acquisition. 

and for the three -month periods ended September 29, 2024 and October 1, 2023, respectively, and amounted to and for the six -month periods ended September 29, 2024 and October 1, 2023, respectively. 
 
 Credit Facility: The Company s credit facility, as most recently amended on July 19, 2024, includes a revolving line of credit and a term loan of million under a financing agreement with CIT. The credit facility includes a revolving line of credit of up to million, which includes a million sub-limit for letters of credit, bearing interest at prime minus or the Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR plus , and is secured by a first lien on all assets of the Company. At September 29, 2024, the Company had elected to pay interest on balances owed under the revolving line of credit under the SOFR option, which was . The financing agreement also provides for the payment by CIT to the Company of interest at prime as of the beginning of the calendar month minus on daily negative balances, if any, held at CIT. 
 
 At September 29, 2024 and March 31, 2024, the balances on the revolving line of credit were million and million, respectively, there was letter of credit outstanding and million and million, respectively, was available under the revolving line of credit based on the Company s eligible accounts receivable and inventory balances. The financing agreement contains usual and customary covenants for agreements of that type, including limitations on other indebtedness, liens, transfers of assets, investments and acquisitions, merger or consolidation transactions, transactions with affiliates, and changes in or amendments to the organizational documents for the Company and its subsidiaries. The Company believes it was in compliance with these covenants as of September 29, 2024. 
 
 The Company s credit facility as of September 29, 2024 also includes an million term loan, issued July 19, 2024, which is payable by the Company in equal monthly installments and bears interest at SOFR plus at September 29, 2024). At September 29, 2024 and March 31, 2024, the balances on the term loan were million and , respectively. 
 
 Credit Concentration: The Company s accounts receivable at September 29, 2024 amounted to million, net of allowances of million. Of this amount, million was due from CIT under the factoring agreements, which represents the maximum loss that the Company could incur if CIT failed completely to perform its obligations under the factoring agreements. The Company s accounts receivable at March 31, 2024 amounted to million, net of allowances of million. Of this amount, million was due from CIT under the factoring agreements, which represented the maximum loss that the Company could have incurred if CIT had failed completely to perform its obligations under the factoring agreements. 

On April 1, 2024, the Company performed a qualitative assessment to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair values of the Company s reporting units are less than their carrying values by evaluating relevant events and circumstances, including financial performance, market conditions and share price. Based on this assessment, the Company concluded that the goodwill for each of the Company s reporting units was not considered at risk of impairment.

The Company does not undertake to update the forward-looking statements contained herein to conform to actual results or changes in the Company s expectations, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. 
 
 DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS 
 
 The Company was originally formed as a Georgia corporation in 1957 and was reincorporated as a Delaware corporation in 2003. The Company operates indirectly through its three wholly-owned subsidiaries, NoJo Baby Kids, Inc., Sassy Baby, Inc. and Manhattan Toy Europe Limited in the infant, toddler and juvenile products segment within the consumer products industry. The infant, toddler and juvenile products segment consists of infant and toddler bedding, diaper bags, bibs, disposables, toys and feeding products. 
 
 The Company s products are marketed under Company-owned trademarks, under trademarks licensed from others and as private label goods. Sales of the Company s products are made directly to retailers, such as mass merchants, large chain stores, juvenile specialty stores, value channel stores, grocery and drug stores, restaurants, wholesale clubs and internet-based retailers. 
 
 The infant, toddler and juvenile consumer products industry is highly competitive. The Company competes with a variety of distributors and manufacturers (both branded and private label), including large infant, toddler and juvenile product companies and specialty infant, toddler and juvenile product manufacturers, on the basis of quality, design, price, brand name recognition, service and packaging. The Company s ability to compete depends principally on styling, price, service to the retailer and continued high regard for the Company s products and trade names. 
 
 Foreign and domestic contract manufacturers produce most of the Company s products, with the largest concentration being in China. The Company makes sourcing decisions based on quality, timeliness of delivery and price, including the impact of ocean freight and duties. Although the Company maintains relationships with a limited number of suppliers, the Company believes that its products may be readily manufactured by several alternative sources in quantities sufficient to meet the Company's requirements. 
 
 The Company s products are warehoused and distributed domestically from leased facilities located in Compton, California and Eden Valley, Minnesota and internationally from third-party logistics warehouses in Belgium and England. 
 
 A summary of certain factors that management considers important in reviewing the Company s results of operations, financial position, liquidity and capital resources is set forth below, which should be read in conjunction with the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes included in the preceding sections of this Quarterly Report.

Net Sales: Sales increased to 24.5 million for the three months ended September 29, 2024, compared with 24.1 million for the three months ended October 1, 2023, an increase of 331,000, or 1.4 . Sales of bedding and diaper bags increased by 2.2 million, and sales of bibs, toys and disposable products decreased by 1.9 million. Sales increased due to the Acquisition, which generated net sales of 3.4 million of bedding and diaper bags, partially offset by a decline in net sales of bibs, toys and disposable products, due to the loss of a program at a major retailer. 
 
 Sales decreased to 40.7 million for the six months ended September 29, 2024, compared with 41.3 million for the six months ended October 1, 2023, a decrease of 580,000, or 1.4 . Sales of bedding and diaper bags increased by 2.9 million due to the Acquisition and sales of bibs, toys and disposable products decreased by 3.5 million, primarily due to a major retailer reducing inventory levels and the loss of a program at another major retailer. 
 
 Gross Profit: Gross profit increased in amount by 361,000 and increased from 27.3 of net sales for the three-month period ended October 1, 2023 to 28.4 of net sales for the three-month period ended September 29, 2024. This increase is considered to be materially consistent with the prior period and resulted from minor changes in product mix offset by increases in rent at our Compton facility. 
 
 Gross profit decreased in amount by 415,000 and decreased from 27.5 of net sales for the six-month period ended October 1, 2023 to 26.9 of net sales for the six-month period ended September 29, 2024. The decrease is considered to be materially consistent with the prior period and relates to an increase in rent at our Compton facility. 
 
 Marketing and Administrative Expenses: Marketing and administrative expenses increased by 1.4 million and increased from 16.7 of net sales for the three-month period ended October 1, 2023 to 22.3 of net sales for the three-month period ended September 29, 2024. The current year period includes 788,000 in acquisition costs as well as increased marketing and administrative costs associated with the Acquisition. 
 
 Marketing and administrative expenses increased by 1.6 million and increased from 19.6 of net sales for the six-month period ended October 1, 2023 to 23.9 of net sales for the six-month period ended September 29, 2024. The current year period includes 244,000 associated with the closure of the Company s subsidiary in the United Kingdom and 903,000 in costs associated with the Acquisition. 
 
 Income Tax Expense: The Company s provision for income taxes is based upon an estimated annual effective tax rate ETR from continuing operations of 22.4 for the six-month period ended September 29, 2024, as compared with an estimated annual ETR from continuing operations of 21.6 for the six-month period ended October 1, 2023. 
 
 As a result of the consideration of the relevant information regarding the state portion of its income tax provision, the Company recorded discrete reserves for unrecognized tax liabilities of 3,000 and 20,000 during the three-month period ended September 29, 2024 and October 1, 2023, respectively, and 3,000 and 25,000 during the six-month period ended September 29, 2024, and October 1, 2023, respectively, in the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of income. The Company also recorded discrete income tax charges of 14,000 and 16,000 during the three months ended September 29, 2024 and October 1, 2023, respectively, and 34,000 and 43,000 during the six-month periods ended September 29, 2024 and October 1, 2023, respectively, to reflect the effects of the tax shortfalls and excess tax benefits arising from the forfeiture and expiration of stock options and the vesting of non-vested stock. 

11

The ETR on continuing operations and the discrete income tax charges and benefits set forth above resulted in an overall provision for income taxes of 27.3 and 24.0 for the six-month periods ended September 29, 2024 and October 1, 2023, respectively. 
 
 Although the Company does not anticipate a material change to the ETR from continuing operations for the remainder of fiscal year 2025, several factors could impact the ETR, including variations from the Company s estimates of the amount and source of its pre-tax income, and the actual ETR for the year could differ materially from the Company s estimates. 
 
 FINANCIAL POSITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 
 Net cash provided by operating activities increased from 4.7 million for the six-month period ended October 1, 2023 to 7.1 million for the six-month period ended September 29, 2024. The increase in the current year was partially the result of an increase in accounts payable in the current year that was 4.0 million higher than the decrease in the prior year and an increase in accrued liabilities in the current year that was 1.2 million higher than the increase in the prior year. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in accounts receivable in the current year that was 710,000 lower than the decrease in the prior year and a 1.6 million decrease in net income from the prior year to the current year. 
 
 Net cash used in investing activities increased from 51,000 in the prior year to 16.9 million in the current year. The increase in the current year is primarily due to the 16.4 payment made in the current year to complete the Acquisition. 
 
 Net cash used in financing activities was 4.5 million for the six-month period ended October 1, 2023 compared with 10.9 million in cash provided by financing activities for the six-month period ended September 29, 2024. The Company incurred net borrowings under its revolving line of credit of 8.3 million and a term loan of 8.0 million that did not occur in the prior period, such borrowings primarily being required to fund the Acquisition. 
 
 As of September 29, 2024, the balance on the revolving line of credit was 13.1 million, there was no letter of credit outstanding and 13.6 million was available under the revolving line of credit based on the Company s eligible accounts receivable and inventory balances. 
 
 To reduce its exposure to credit losses and to enhance the predictability of its cash flow, the Company assigns the majority of its trade accounts receivable to CIT under factoring agreements. Under the terms of the factoring agreements, CIT remits customer payments to the Company as such payments are received by CIT. As such, the Company does not take advances on the factoring agreements. 
 
 CIT bears credit losses with respect to assigned accounts receivable from approved shipments, while the Company bears the responsibility for adjustments from customers related to returns, allowances, claims and discounts. CIT may at any time terminate or limit its approval of shipments to a particular customer. If such a termination or limitation occurs, then the Company either assumes (and may seek to mitigate) the credit risk for shipments to the customer after the date of such termination or limitation or discontinues shipments to the customer. Factoring fees, which are included in marketing and administrative expenses in the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated statements of income, amounted to 94,000 and 92,000 for the three-month periods ended September 29, 2024 and October 1, 2023, respectively, and amounted to 168,000 and 159,000 for the six-month periods ended September 29, 2024 and October 1, 2023, respectively. 
 
 The Company s future performance is, to a certain extent, subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors beyond its control. Based upon the current level of operations, the Company believes that its cash flow from operations and funds available under the revolving line of credit will be adequate to meet its liquidity needs. 
 
 ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 
 For a discussion of market risks that could affect the Company, refer to the risk factors disclosed in Item 1A. of Part 1 of the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2024. 

12

INTEREST RATE RISK 
 
 As of September 29, 2024, the Company had 20.8 million of indebtedness that bears interest at a variable rate, comprised of borrowings under the revolving line of credit and a term loan. Based upon this level of outstanding debt, the Company s annual net income would decrease by approximately 161,000 for each increase of one percentage point in the interest rate applicable to the debt. 
 
 COMMODITY RATE RISK 
 
 The Company sources its products primarily from foreign contract manufacturers, with the largest concentration being in China. The Company s exposure to commodity price risk primarily relates to changes in the prices in China of cotton, oil and labor, which are the principal inputs used in a substantial number of the Company s products. In addition, although the Company pays its Chinese suppliers in U.S. dollars, a strengthening of the rate of the Chinese currency versus the U.S. dollar could result in an increase in the cost of the Company s finished goods. There is no assurance that the Company could timely respond to such increases by proportionately increasing the prices at which its products are sold to the Company s customers. 
 
 MARKET CONCENTRATION RISK 
 
 The Company s financial results are closely tied to sales to its top two customers, which represented approximately 61 of the Company s gross sales in fiscal year 2024. In addition, 40 of the Company s gross sales in fiscal year 2024 consisted of licensed products, which included 24 of sales associated with the Company s license agreements with affiliated companies of the Walt Disney Company. The Company s results could be materially impacted by the loss of one or more of these licenses. Since the filing of the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2024, the Company acquired Baby Boom which designs and sells licensed and unlicensed bedding and diaper bag products. 
 
 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 
 The Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have evaluated the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report, as required by paragraph (b) of Rules 13a-15 or 15d-15 of the Exchange Act. Based on such evaluation, such officers have concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report, the Company s disclosure controls and procedures are effective. 
 
 During the three-month period ended September 29, 2024, there were no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting ICFR identified in connection with the evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Rules 13a-15 or 15d-15 of the Exchange Act that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s ICFR.
