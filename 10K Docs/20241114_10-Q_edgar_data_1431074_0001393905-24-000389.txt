 In December 2007, the Financial Accounting Standard Board FASB issued ASC 810-10-65, Non-controlling Interests in consolidated financial statements, an amendment of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51 SFAS No. 160 ). This ASC clarifies that a non-controlling (minority) interest in a subsidiary is an ownership interest in the entity that should be reported as equity in the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. It also requires consolidated net income to include the amounts attributable to both the parent and non-controlling interest, with disclosure on the face of the consolidated income statement of the amounts attributed to the parent and to the non-controlling interest. In accordance with ASC 810-10- 45-21, those losses attributable to the parent and the non-controlling interest in subsidiaries may exceed their interests in the subsidiary s equity. The excess and any further losses attributable to the parent and the non-controlling interest shall be attributed to those interests even if that attribution results in a deficit non-controlling interest balance.

ASC 825-10 Financial Instruments allows entities to voluntarily choose to measure certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value (fair value option). The fair value option may be elected on an instrument-by-instrument basis and is irrevocable unless a new election date occurs. If the fair value option is elected for an instrument, unrealized gains and losses for that instrument should be reported in earnings at each subsequent reporting date. The Company did not elect to apply the fair value option to any outstanding equity instruments. 
 
 . To reduce its risk associated with the failure of such financial institutions, the Company evaluates, at least annually, the rating of the financial institutions in which it holds deposits. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company did not have cash in excess of FDIC limits.

 Plan of Operation 
 
 The Bergio brand is our most important asset. The Bergio brand is associated with high-quality, handcrafted and individually designed pieces with European sensibility, Italian craftsmanship and a bold flair for the unexpected. Bergio, is one of the most coveted brands of fine jewelry. Established in 1995, Bergio s signature innovative design, coupled with extraordinary diamonds and precious stones, earned the company recognition as a highly sought-after purveyor of rare and exquisite treasures from around the globe. 
 
 It is our intention to establish Bergio as a holding company for the purpose of establishing retails stores worldwide. Our branded product lines are products and/or collections designed by our designer and CEO Berge Abajian and will be the centerpiece of our retail stores. We also intend to complement our own quality-designed jewelry with other products and our own specially designed handbags. This is in line with our strategy and belief that a brand name can create an association with innovation, design and quality which helps add value to the individual products as well as facilitate the introduction of new products. 
 
 It is our intention to open elegant stores in high-end areas and provide excellent service in our stores which will be staffed with knowledgeable professionals. 
 
 In 2019 we introduced The Silver Fashion Collection ranging in price from 50 to 1,200. The Company also introduced the Bergio Handbag Collection, manufactured in Italy with top quality Italian leather ranging in price from 450 to 875, which are very competitive entry prices. 
 38 
 
 Our products consist of a wide range of unique styles and designs made from precious metals such as, gold, platinum, and Karat gold, as well as diamonds and other precious stones. We currently design and produce approximately 100 to 150 product styles. Current retail prices for our products range from 400 to 200,000. We have manufacturing control over our line as a result of having a manufacturing facility in New Jersey as well as subcontracts with facilities located in Italy. 
 
 On March 5, 2014, the Company formed a wholly owned subsidiary called Crown Luxe, Inc. in the State of Delaware Crown Luxe ). Crown Luxe was established to operate the Company s first retail store, which was opened in Bergen County, New Jersey in 2014. 
 
 During the fall of 2018, we opened our second retail store at the Ocean Resort Casino in Atlantic City, New Jersey. In September 2023, we closed the retail store located at the Ocean Resort Casino in Atlantic City, New Jersey. We opened a new retail store in March 2023 located in Marmora, New Jersey.

We own 51 of GearBubble Tech, Inc. 
 
 The funding for these acquisitions were a combination of proceeds from the issuance of common stock from our previous S-1 Registration Statement and debt. 
 
 Aphrodite s Marketing and GearBubble Tech were expected to increase our online presence and provide for expansion of the Bergio Brand. Aphrodite s Marketing was a one-stop shop for jewelry, gifts, and surprises for any occasion. In December 2023, the Company decided to sell the Company s majority owned subsidiary, Aphrodite s Marketing. On June 19, 2024, the Company entered into a Purchase Agreement with a buyer to purchase all the assets of Aphrodite s Marketing. The total purchase price for the purchased assets shall be 1,000,000.

The Company has been also investigating various strategies to increase sales and expand its business. The Company is in negotiations with some potential partners, but, at this time, there is nothing concrete, but the Company remains positive about its prospects. However, there is no assurance that the Company will be successful in its endeavors or that it will be able to increase its business. 
 
 Our future operations are contingent upon increasing revenues and raising capital for on-going operations and expansion of our product lines. Because we have a limited operating history, you may have difficulty evaluating our business and future prospects. 
 
 The Company s retail operations were and may continue to be affected by the COVID-19 which in March 2020, was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization. Although it has been 4 years since the outbreak of COVID- 
 39 
 
 19, the ultimate disruption which may be caused by a future outbreak is uncertain; however, it may result in a material adverse impact on the Company s financial position, operations and cash flows. Possible areas that may be affected include, but are not limited to, disruption to the Company s customers and revenue, labor workforce, unavailability of products and supplies used in operations, and the decline in value of assets held by the Company, including property and equipment.

 Cash provided by financing activities from continuing operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was 332,783 and was primarily the result of advance from CEO, net of 192,783 and received proceeds from notes and convertible notes of 140,000. Cash provided by financing activities from discontinued operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was 141,208. 
 
 Our indebtedness is comprised of various convertible debt, notes payable, loans payable, and advances from a stockholder/officer intended to provide capital for the ongoing manufacturing of our jewelry line, in advance of receipt of the payment from our retail distributors. 
 
 Convertible Notes 
 
 From time to time the Company enters into certain financing agreements for convertible notes. For the most part, the Company settles these obligations with the Company s common stock. As of September 30, 2024, principal amounts under the convertible notes payable was 158,947, net of debt discount of 3,309 including put premiums of 158,947. 
 
 Notes Payable 
 
 The Company has total notes payable of 699,378 classified as current portion and 112,622 classified as long-term portion at September 30, 2024. 
 
 Mandatorily Redeemable Preferred Stock 
 
 The Company has mandatorily redeemable preferred stock liability of 634,000 at September 30, 2024. 
 
 Satisfaction of Our Cash Obligations for the Next 12 Months 
 
 A critical component of our operating plan impacting our continued existence is to efficiently manage our retail operations and successfully develop new lines through our Company or through possible acquisitions and/or mergers as well as opening new retail stores. Our ability to obtain capital through additional equity and/or debt financing, and joint venture partnerships will also be important to our expansion plans. In the event we experience any significant problems assimilating acquired assets into our operations or cannot obtain the necessary capital to pursue our strategic 
 plan, we may have to reduce the growth of our operations. This may materially impact our ability to increase revenue and continue our growth. 
 
 The Company has suffered recurring losses and has an accumulated deficit of approximately 22.5 million as of September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, the Company has 158,947 in principal amounts of convertible notes, notes payable (current and long-term portion) of 812,000, current liabilities of discontinued operations of 1,035,967 and 634,000 in mandatorily redeemable preferred stock liability. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The recoverability of a major portion of the recorded asset amounts shown in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet is dependent upon continued operations of the Company, which in turn, is dependent upon the Company s ability to raise capital and/or generate positive cash flows from operations. 
 
 These condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded assets, or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary in the event the Company cannot continue in existence.

In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can only provide a reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and in reaching a reasonable level of assurance, management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Management designed the disclosure controls and procedures to provide reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. 
 
 We carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our PEO and PFO, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report. Based upon that evaluation, the PEO and PFO concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were not effective.

 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act, during our most recently completed fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
