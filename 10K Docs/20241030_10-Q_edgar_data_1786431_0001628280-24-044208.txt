 External Debt Facilities 
 In February 2020, we entered into new external debt facilities External Debt Facilities ), which consisted of (i) a million senior secured term loan facility Term Loan Facility and (ii) a million senior secured revolving credit facility Revolving Facility ). In February 2023, we amended the External Debt Facilities Amendment No.1 which replaced the interest rate benchmark from the London Interbank Offered Rate LIBOR to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR ). Additionally, in November 2023, we further amended the External Debt Facilities Amendment No. 2 to extend the maturity of the Revolving Facility by one year. Other than the foregoing, the material terms of the External Debt Facilities, as amended by Amendment No. 1 and Amendment No. 2 Amended External Debt Facilities remain unchanged, and our election to use practical expedients under ASU 2020-04 and ASU 2021-01 resulted in no material impacts on our condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 Borrowings under the Amended External Debt Facilities bear interest at a rate per annum equal to, at our option, either a base rate plus an applicable margin of or a SOFR plus an applicable margin of . We have entered into a series of interest rate swaps to hedge a portion of the interest rate exposure resulting from these borrowings. Refer to Note 5 Financial Instruments for further details. 
 The Amended External Debt Facilities contain a springing financial covenant requiring compliance with a ratio of first lien net indebtedness to consolidated EBITDA, applicable solely to the Revolving Facility. The financial covenant is tested on the last day of any fiscal quarter only if the aggregate principal amount of borrowings under the Revolving Facility and drawn but unreimbursed letters of credit exceed of the total amount of commitments under the Revolving Facility on such day. We are currently in compliance with the covenants contained in our Amended External Debt Facilities. 
 If an event of default occurs, the lenders under the Amended External Debt Facilities are entitled to take various actions, including the acceleration of amounts due under the Amended External Debt Facilities and all actions permitted to be taken by secured creditors. 
 Term Loan Facility 
 The Term Loan Facility matures in February 2027. The Term Loan Facility amortizes in equal quarterly installments of million, which commenced in June 2020, with the balance payable on maturity. During the year ended December 31, 2023, we made voluntary principal payments of million related to our Term Loan Facility, which were first applied to pay the remaining quarterly amortization payments in full, with the residual balance applied to the outstanding principal balance due at maturity. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we made voluntary principal payments of million and million, respectively, related to our Term Loan Facility, which were applied to the outstanding principal balance due at maturity.

outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Facility, and we had million of letters of credit outstanding, which reduces the borrowing capacity under the Revolving Facility. 
 Fair Value of Our Long-Term Debt 
 The fair value of our long-term debt as of September 30, 2024, which is a Level 2 fair value measurement, approximates the carrying value due to the variable market interest rate and the stability of our credit profile.

 million, and the SOFR is fixed at an annual rate of to (for an annual effective interest rate of to , including margin). 
 The interest rate swaps outstanding as of September 30, 2024 hedge a portion of the interest rate exposure resulting from our Term Loan Facility for a period of approximately one to . We classified these instruments as cash flow hedges. The effective portion of the gain or loss on the open hedging instrument is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income and is reclassified into earnings as interest expense, net when settled. The associated asset or liability on the open hedges is recorded at its fair value in other assets or other liabilities, as applicable. The fair value of the interest rate swaps was determined using a discounted cash flow method based on market-based swap yield curves, taking into account current interest rates, and is classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy.

 Description of the Company and its Business Segments 
 We are a market-leading consumer products company with a presence in 95 of households across the United States. We produce and sell products across three broad categories: cooking products, waste and storage products and tableware. We sell our products under iconic brands such as Reynolds and Hefty and also under store brands that are strategically important to our retail partners. Overall, across both our branded and store brand offerings, we hold the #1 or #2 U.S. market share position in the majority of product categories in which we participate. Over 65 of our revenue comes from products that are #1 in their respective categories. We have developed our market-leading position by investing in our product categories and consistently developing innovative products that meet the evolving needs and preferences of the modern consumer. 
 Our mix of branded and store brand products is a key competitive advantage that aligns our goal of growing the overall product categories where we have offerings. Our retail partners also measure their success in category growth, which positions us as a trusted strategic partner.

Overview 
 Total net revenues decreased 3 in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. The revenue decrease was primarily due to lower volume. 
 Total net revenues decreased 3 in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. The revenue decrease was primarily due to lower volume. 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, our net income increased by 10 , primarily driven by lower selling, general and administrative expenses, lower material and manufacturing costs and lower interest expense. These were partially offset by higher income tax expense as a result of higher pre-tax income. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our net income increased by 43 , primarily driven by lower material and manufacturing costs and lower interest expense. These were partially offset by higher income tax expense as a result of higher pre-tax income. 
 
 Non-GAAP Measures 
 In this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q we use the non-GAAP financial measure Adjusted EBITDA , which is a non- GAAP measure. 
 We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income calculated in accordance with GAAP, plus the sum of income tax expense, net interest expense, depreciation and amortization and as may be further adjusted to exclude certain non-recurring items, if applicable. 
 We present Adjusted EBITDA because it is a key measure used by our management team to evaluate our operating performance, generate future operating plans and make strategic decisions. In addition, our chief operating decision maker uses Adjusted EBITDA of each reportable segment to evaluate the operating performance of such segments. Accordingly, we believe presenting this measure provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management team and board of directors. 
 Non-GAAP information should be considered as supplemental in nature and is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, our non-GAAP financial measures may not be the same as or comparable to similar non-GAAP financial measures presented by other companies. 
 The following table presents a reconciliation of our net income, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, to Adjusted EBITDA: 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 (in millions) (in millions) Net income GAAP 86 78 231 161 Income tax expense 27 25 62 54 Interest expense, net 25 31 76 91 Depreciation and amortization 33 31 96 92 Adjusted EBITDA (Non-GAAP) 171 165 465 398

Results of Operations Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 
 The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Detailed comparisons of revenue and results are presented in the discussions of the operating segments, which follow our consolidated results discussion. 
 Certain discussions in this section provide a breakdown of net revenues between our retail and non-retail businesses. Our retail business net revenues consist of sales to grocery stores, mass merchants, warehouse clubs, discount chains, dollar stores, drug stores, home improvement stores, military outlets and eCommerce retailers. Our non-retail business net revenues consist of aluminum sales to food service customers, which are classified as related party revenues, and industrial customers.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Our principal sources of liquidity are existing cash and cash equivalents, cash generated from operating activities and available borrowings under the Revolving Facility. 
 The following table discloses our cash flows for the periods presented: 
 
 For the Nine Months Ended September 30, (in millions) 2024 2023 Net cash provided by operating activities 307 423 Net cash used in investing activities (79) (77) Net cash used in financing activities (247) (260) (Decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents (19) 86 
 
 Cash provided by operating activities 
 Net cash from operating activities decreased by 116 million to 307 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The decrease was primarily driven by higher net investment in inventory during the current period and higher income tax payments due to higher taxable income, partially offset by higher net income, higher accounts payable due to working capital initiatives and lower interest payments. 
 Cash used in investing activities 
 Net cash used in investing activities increased by 2 million to 79 million. The increase was driven by an increase in cash outlays for capital expenditures. 
 Cash used in financing activities 
 Net cash used in financing activities decreased by 13 million to 247 million. The decrease was primarily attributable to 13 million of scheduled amortization payments made on our Term Loan Facility during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, which did not repeat in the current year period as a result of our voluntary prepayments. 
 24 

External Debt Facilities 
 In February 2020, we entered into the External Debt Facilities which consist of a 2,475 million Term Loan Facility and a Revolving Facility that provided for additional borrowing capacity of up to 250 million, reduced by amounts used for letters of credit. In February 2023, we amended the External Debt Facilities Amendment No.1 which replaced the interest rate benchmark from LIBOR to the SOFR. Additionally, in November 2023, we further amended the External Debt Facilities Amendment No. 2 to extend the maturity of the Revolving Facility by one year. Other than the foregoing, the material terms of the agreement remained unchanged. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the outstanding balance under the Term Loan Facility was 1,745 million. As of September 30, 2024, we had no outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Facility, and we had 6 million of letters of credit outstanding, which reduces the borrowing capacity under the Revolving Facility. 
 The borrower under the Amended External Debt Facilities is Reynolds Consumer Products LLC (the Borrower ). The Revolving Facility includes a sub-facility for letters of credit. In addition, the Amended External Debt Facilities provide that the Borrower has the right at any time, subject to customary conditions, to request incremental term loans or incremental revolving credit commitments in amounts and on terms set forth therein. The lenders under the Amended External Debt Facilities are not under any obligation to provide any such incremental loans or commitments, and any such addition of or increase in loans is subject to certain customary conditions precedent and other provisions. 
 Subsequent to September 30, 2024, we amended our Amended External Debt Facilities to replace the undrawn 250 million revolving facility maturing in February 2026 with an undrawn 700 million revolving facility maturing in October 2029. Our Term Loan Facility under the Credit Agreement continues to mature in February 2027. 
 Interest rate 
 Borrowings under the Amended External Debt Facilities bear interest at a rate per annum equal to, at our option, either a base rate plus an applicable margin of 0.75 or SOFR plus an applicable margin of 1.75 . 
 During 2020 and 2022, we entered into a series of interest rate swaps to fix the LIBOR of our External Debt Facilities. In February 2023, we amended our interest rate swaps to replace the interest rate benchmark from LIBOR to SOFR. Other than the foregoing, the material terms of the interest rate swap agreements remained unchanged, and our election to use practical expedients under ASUs 2020-04 and 2021-01 resulted in no material impacts on the condensed consolidated financial statements. The aggregate notional amount of the interest rate swaps still in effect as of September 30, 2024 was 1,150 million, and the SOFR is fixed at an annual rate of 0.40 to 3.40 (for an annual effective interest rate of 2.15 to 5.15 , including margin). These interest rate swaps hedge a portion of the interest rate exposure resulting from our Term Loan Facility for periods ranging from one to two years. 
 Prepayments 
 The Term Loan Facility contains customary mandatory prepayments, including with respect to excess cash flow, asset sale proceeds and proceeds from certain incurrences of indebtedness. 
 The Borrower may voluntarily repay outstanding loans under the Term Loan Facility at any time without premium or penalty, other than customary breakage costs with respect to SOFR based loans. 
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we made voluntary principal payments of 50 million and 100 million related to our Term Loan Facility, which was applied to the outstanding principal balance due at maturity. Subsequent to September 30, 2024, we made an additional voluntary principal payment of 50 million related to the Term Loan Facility. 
 Amortization and maturity 
 The Term Loan Facility matures in February 2027. The Term Loan Facility amortizes in equal quarterly installments of 6 million, which commenced in June 2020, with the balance payable on maturity. During the year ended December 31, 2023, we made voluntary principal payments of 250 million related to our Term Loan Facility, which were first applied to pay the remaining quarterly amortization payments in full, with the residual balance applied to the outstanding principal balance due at maturity. 
 As amended effective October 17, 2024, the Revolving Facility matures in October 2029.

Guarantee and security 
 All obligations under the Amended External Debt Facilities and certain hedge agreements and cash management arrangements provided by any lender party to the Amended External Debt Facilities or any of its affiliates and certain other persons are unconditionally guaranteed by Reynolds Consumer Products Inc. RCPI ), the Borrower (with respect to hedge agreements and cash management arrangements not entered into by the Borrower) and certain of RCPI s existing and subsequently acquired or organized direct or indirect material wholly-owned U.S. restricted subsidiaries, with customary exceptions including, among other things, where providing such guarantees is not permitted by law, regulation or contract or would result in material adverse tax consequences. 
 All obligations under the Amended External Debt Facilities and certain hedge agreements and cash management arrangements provided by any lender party to the Amended External Debt Facilities or any of its affiliates and certain other persons, and the guarantees of such obligations, are secured, subject to permitted liens and other exceptions, by: (i) a perfected first-priority pledge of all the equity interests of each wholly-owned material restricted subsidiary of RCPI, the Borrower or a subsidiary guarantor, including the equity interests of the Borrower (limited to 65 of voting stock in the case of first-tier non-U.S. subsidiaries of RCPI, the Borrower or any subsidiary guarantor) and (ii) perfected first-priority security interests in substantially all tangible and intangible personal property of RCPI, the Borrower and the subsidiary guarantors (subject to certain other exclusions). 
 Certain covenants and events of default 
 The Amended External Debt Facilities contain a number of covenants that, among other things, restrict, subject to certain exceptions, our ability and the ability of the restricted subsidiaries of RCPI to: 
 incur additional indebtedness and guarantee indebtedness; 
 create or incur liens; 
 engage in mergers or consolidations; 
 sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of assets; 
 pay dividends and distributions or repurchase capital stock; 
 prepay, redeem or repurchase certain indebtedness; 
 make investments, loans and advances; 
 enter into certain transactions with affiliates; 
 enter into agreements which limit the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to incur restrictions on their ability to make distributions; and 
 enter into amendments to certain indebtedness in a manner materially adverse to the lenders. 
 The Amended External Debt Facilities contain a springing financial covenant requiring compliance with a ratio of first lien net indebtedness to consolidated EBITDA, applicable solely to the Revolving Facility. The financial covenant is tested on the last day of any fiscal quarter only if the aggregate principal amount of borrowings under the Revolving Facility and drawn but unreimbursed letters of credit exceed 35 of the total amount of commitments under the Revolving Facility on such day. 
 If an event of default occurs, the lenders under the Amended External Debt Facilities are entitled to take various actions, including the acceleration of amounts due under the Amended External Debt Facilities and all actions permitted to be taken by secured creditors. 
 We are currently in compliance with the covenants contained in our Amended External Debt Facilities.

Accounts Receivable Factoring 
 We are party to a factoring agreement with JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. to sell certain accounts receivable up to 95 million. We had no outstanding balance owed under the factoring arrangement as of September 30, 2024 . Transactions under this agreement are accounted for as sales of accounts receivable, and the receivables sold are removed from the condensed consolidated balance sheet at the time of the sales transaction. We classify the proceeds received from the sales of accounts receivable as an operating cash flow in the condensed consolidated statement of cash flows. We record the discount as other expense, net in the condensed consolidated statement of income. 
 Supply Chain Financing 
 In March 2023, we initiated a voluntary Supply Chain Finance program (the SCF with a global financial institution (the SCF Bank ). Under the SCF, qualifying suppliers may elect to sell their receivables from us to the SCF Bank. These participating suppliers negotiate their receivables sales arrangements directly with the SCF Bank. We are not party to those agreements, nor do we provide any security or other forms of guarantees to the SCF Bank. The participation in the program is at the sole discretion of the supplier, we have no economic interest in a supplier s decision to enter into the agreement and have no direct financial relationship with the SCF Bank, as it relates to the SCF. Once a qualifying supplier elects to participate in the SCF and reaches an agreement with the SCF Bank, they elect which individual invoices they sell to the SCF Bank. 
 The terms of our payment obligations are not impacted by a supplier s participation in the SCF and as such, the SCF has no direct impact on our balance sheets, cash flows, or liquidity. Our payment terms with our suppliers for similar services and materials within individual markets are consistent between suppliers that elect to participate in the SCF and those that do not participate. 
 All outstanding amounts related to suppliers participating in the SCF are recorded within accounts payable in our condensed consolidated balance sheet and associated payments are included as an operating cash flow in the condensed consolidated statement of cash flows. As of September 30, 2024 , the amount of obligations outstanding that we have confirmed as valid under the SCF was 8 million. As of December 31 , 2023 , the amount of obligations outstanding that we had confirmed as valid under the SCF was 19 million. 
 Dividends 
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, cash dividends of 0.23 and 0.69 per share, respectively, were declared and paid. On October 24, 2024, a quarterly cash dividend of 0.23 per share was declared and is to be paid on November 29, 2024. We expect to continue paying cash dividends on a quarterly basis; however, future dividends are at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend upon our earnings, capital requirements, financial condition, contractual limitations (including under the Amended External Debt Facilities) and other factors. 
 
 We believe that our projected cash position, cash flows from operations, including proceeds from factored receivables, and available borrowings under the Revolving Facility are sufficient to meet debt service, capital expenditures and working capital needs for the foreseeable future. However, we cannot ensure that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available under our borrowing agreements in amounts sufficient to pay indebtedness or fund other liquidity needs. Actual results of operations will depend on numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control as further discussed in Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 Accounting policies and estimates are considered critical when they require management to make subjective and complex judgments, estimates and assumptions about matters that have a material impact on the presentation of our financial statements and accompanying notes. For a description of our critical accounting policies and estimates, see our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023.

 a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )) are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. 
 In connection with the preparation of this report, management, under the supervision and with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective. 
 b) Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
