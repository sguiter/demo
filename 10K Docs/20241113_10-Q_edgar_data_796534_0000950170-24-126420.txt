 (2) of consideration to be paid in cash of per FCB common share, at the shareholders election. Payments for shareholder elections and fractional shares totaled . Outstanding and vested options were settled at the difference between and the strike price and totaled . 

 Management made significant estimates and exercised significant judgment in accounting for the acquisition of FCB. The following is a brief description of the valuation methodologies used to estimate the fair values of major categories of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The Company utilized a valuation specialist to assist with the determination of fair values for certain acquired assets and assumed liabilities. Cash and equivalents Included in cash and equivalents are an investment in time deposits of other financial institutions, valued at the present value of the expected contractual payments discounted at market rates for instruments with similar terms. Securities The estimated fair value of the acquired portfolio of debt securities was based on quoted market prices. All of the acquired portfolio was sold upon completion of the acquisition.

Fair value 

Premises and equipment The fair value of premises acquired was based on a recent third-party appraisal. Acquired equipment was based on the remaining net book value of FCB, which approximated fair value. Core Deposit Intangible Core deposit relationships provide a stable source of funds for lending and contribute to profitability. The core deposit intangible was valued using an income approach focused on cost savings, which recognizes the cost savings represented by the expense of maintaining the core deposit base versus the cost of an alternative funding source. The valuation incorporates assumptions related to account retention, discount rates, deposit interest rates, deposit maintenance costs and alternative funding rates. Leases: right of use asset, lease liability and fair value Right of use assets (included in other assets) and lease liabilities (included in other liabilities) for branch locations were measured at the acquisition date. The fair value of leases was determined by applying a discounted cash flow methodology discounted by current lease rates within the appropriate market. Deposits Deposits were valued using methods appropriate to their characteristics. The fair value of noninterest bearing demand deposits, interest bearing demand deposits, money market and savings deposit accounts were assumed to approximate the carrying value as these accounts have no stated maturity and are payable on demand. Time deposits were valued at the present value of the expected contractual payments discounted at market rates for instruments with similar terms. Borrowings The estimated fair value of borrowings was determined by obtaining payoff quotes from the lender. Borrowings were paid off upon completion of the acquisition. Deferred Tax Asset Application of fair value measurements resulted in an increase to the deferred tax asset, included in other assets.

Credit Quality The Company categorizes loans by risk based on relevant information about the ability of borrowers to service their debt, including: collateral and financial information, historical payment experience, credit documentation and current economic trends, among other factors. At origination, each loan is assigned a risk rating. Ongoing analysis of the loan portfolio adjusts risk ratings on an individual loan basis to reflect updated information. Loans rated pass have acceptable credit quality. Loans rated special mention have potential weakness due to challenging economic or financial conditions. Loans rated classified have well-defined weaknesses that heighten the risk of default. The tables below present the loan portfolio by amortized cost basis, year of origination, loan class and credit quality, and gross charge-offs for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and year ended December 31, 2023.

Loan Modifications to Borrowers Experiencing Financial Difficulty The Company modifies loans for a variety of reasons. At the date of modification, the Company assesses whether the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty. If the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty, the loan s risk rating is evaluated and is typically changed to special mention or classified, which results in individual evaluation of the loan for the ACLL. Two loans were modified for borrowers experiencing financial difficulty during the first three months of 2024. These loans were modified again during the three months ended September 30, 2024. There was loan to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty that was modified during the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

There were loans to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty that had a payment default during the three or nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 and were modified in the twelve months prior to that default. Default is determined at 90 or more days past due, upon charge-off, or upon foreclosure. Modified loans in default are individually evaluated for the allowance for credit losses or if the modified loan is deemed uncollectible, the loan, or a portion of the loan, is written off and the allowance for credit losses is adjusted accordingly. Consumer Real Estate Loans In Process of Foreclosure As of September 30, 2024 , the Company had three consumer real estate loans totaling in process of foreclosure. As of December 31, 2023 , one consumer real estate loan of was in process of foreclosure.

Total temporarily impaired securities 

The Company evaluates securities available for sale that are in unrealized loss positions to determine whether the impairment is due to credit-related factors or noncredit-related factors. Consideration is given to the extent to which the fair value is less than cost, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer, and the intent and ability of the Company to retain its investment in the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value. At September 30, 2024, the Company had securities with a fair value of in an unrealized loss position. The Company reviews securities in an unrealized loss position to evaluate credit risk. The Company considers payment history, risk ratings from external parties, financial statements for municipal and corporate securities, public statements from issuers and other available credible published sources in evaluating credit risk. No credit risk was found and no ACL on securities available for sale was recorded as of September 30, 2024. The unrealized losses are attributed to noncredit-related factors, including changes in interest rates and other market conditions. The Company does not have the intent to sell any of these securities and believes that it is more likely than not that the Company will not have to sell any such securities before a recovery of cost. The contractual terms of the investments do not permit the issuers to settle the securities at a price less than the cost basis of the investments. The fair value is expected to recover as the securities approach their maturity date or repricing date or if market yields for such investments decline. Restricted Stock. The Company holds restricted stock that is reported separately from available for sale securities. As a member of the Federal Reserve and the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta FHLB ), NBB is required to maintain certain minimum investments in the common stock of those entities. Required levels of investment are based upon NBB s capital and a percentage of qualifying assets. The Company purchases stock from or sells stock back to the correspondents based on their calculations. The stock is held by member institutions only and is not actively traded. Redemption of FHLB stock is subject to certain limitations and conditions. At its discretion, the FHLB may declare dividends on the stock. In addition to dividends, NBB also benefits from its membership with FHLB through eligibility to borrow from the FHLB, using as collateral NBB s capital stock investment in the FHLB and qualifying NBB real estate mortgage loans totaling at September 30, 2024. The Company s management reviews for impairment based upon the ultimate recoverability of the cost basis of the FHLB stock, and at September 30, 2024, did not determine any impairment. Realized Securities Gains and Losses The Company initiated sale of FCB s securities portfolio upon completion of the acquisition, and no gain or loss was recorded. During the first nine months of 2023, the Company realized net securities losses of on the sale of securities with an amortized cost basis of . The sales were part of the Company s interest rate risk management strategy.

The Company s securities portfolio is valued using Level 2 inputs. The Company relies on an independent third party vendor to provide market valuations. The inputs used to determine value include: benchmark yields, reported trades, broker/dealer quotes, issuer spreads, two-sided markets, benchmark securities, bids, offers and reference data including market research publications. The third party vendor also monitors market indicators, industry activity and economic events as part of the valuation process. Central to the final valuation is the assumption that the indicators used are representative of the fair value of securities held within the Company s portfolio. Level 2 inputs are subject to a certain degree of uncertainty and changes in these assumptions or methodologies in the future, if any, may impact securities fair value, deferred tax assets or liabilities, or expense. Interest Rate Loan Contracts and Forward Sale Commitments The Company originates consumer real estate loans which it intends to sell to a correspondent lender. Interest rate loan contracts and forward sale commitments result from originating loans held for sale and are derivatives reported at fair value. The Company enters interest rate lock commitments with customers who apply for a loan which the Company intends to sell to a correspondent lender. The interest rate loan contract ends when the loan closes or the customer withdraws their application. Fair value of the interest rate loan contract is based upon the correspondent lender s pricing quotes at the report date. Fair value is adjusted for the estimated probability of the loan closing with the borrower. At the time the Company enters into an interest rate loan contract with a customer, it also enters into a best efforts forward sales commitment with the correspondent lender. If the loan is closed and funded, the best efforts commitment converts to a mandatory forward sales commitment. Fair value is based on the gain or loss that would occur if the Company were to pair-off the transaction with the investor at the measurement date. This is a Level 3 input. The Company measures and reports best efforts commitments at fair value. Interest rate loan contracts and forward sale commitments are valued based on quotes from the correspondent lender at the reporting date. Pricing changes daily and if a loan has not been sold to the correspondent by the next reporting date, the fair value may be different from that reported currently. Changes in fair value measurement impacts net income. As of September 30, 2024, three funded loans gave rise to a liability for the forward sales commitment. The Company had one rate lock commitment as of December 31, 2023, resulting in an asset for the interest rate loan contract and a liability for the forward sales commitment, and one funded loan resulting in a forward sales commitment. The following tables present information on the interest rate loan contracts and forward sale commitments as of the date indicated:

 Financial Instruments Measured at Fair Value on a Non-Recurring Basis Certain financial instruments are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis in accordance with GAAP. Adjustments to the fair value of these assets usually result from the application of lower-of-cost-or-market accounting or write-downs of individual assets. The following describes the valuation techniques used by the Company to measure certain assets recorded at fair value on a nonrecurring basis in the consolidated financial statements. Loans Held for Sale Loans held for sale are carried at the lower of cost or fair value. These loans currently consist of one-to-four family residential loans originated for sale in the secondary market. Fair value is based on the price secondary markets are currently offering for similar loans using observable market data which is not materially different than cost due to the short duration between origination and sale (Level 2). As such, the Company records any fair value adjustments on a nonrecurring basis. A liability of for the fair value of loans held for sale was recorded as of September 30, 2024 . nonrecurring fair value adjustments were recorded on loans held for sale at December 31, 2023. Collateral Dependent Loans Collateral dependent loans are measured on a non-recurring basis for the ACLL. If the fair value of the collateral is lower than the loan s amortized cost basis, the shortfall is recognized in the ACLL. When repayment is expected from the operation of the collateral, fair value is estimated as the present value of expected cash flows from the operation of the collateral. When repayment is expected from the sale of the collateral, fair value is estimated using measurement techniques discussed below and discounted by the estimated cost to sell. The ACLL may be zero if the fair value of the collateral at the measurement date exceeds the amortized cost basis of the financial asset. For loans secured by real estate, fair value of collateral is determined by the as-is value of appraisals or third party evaluations that are less than 24 months of age. Appraisals are prepared by independent, licensed appraisers. Appraisals are based upon observable market data analyzed through an income or sales valuation approach. Valuation falls within Level 2 categorization. The Company may further discount appraisals for marketing strategies, which results in Level 3 categorization. The value of business equipment is based upon an outside appraisal (Level 2) if deemed significant, or the net book value on the applicable business financial statements (Level 3) if not considered significant. Likewise, values for inventory and accounts receivables collateral are based on financial statement balances or aging reports (Level 3). As of September 30, 2024 , one consumer real estate loan totaling and three commercial real estate loans totaling were collateral dependent. Valuation of the consumer real estate loan and two of the commercial real estate loans were based upon third party evaluations (Level 2). Valuation for one commercial real estate loan was based upon an internal evaluation (Level 3). None of the measurements resulted in a specific allocation.

to the right of use asset and the lease liability. Lease payments Short-term lease payments are recognized as lease expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term, or for variable lease payments, in the period in which the obligation was incurred. Operating and finance lease payments may be fixed for the term of the lease or variable. If the escalation factor for a variable lease payment is known, such as a specified percentage increase per year or a stated increase at a specified time, the variable payment is included in the cash flows used to determine the lease liability. If the variable payment is based upon an unknown escalator, such as the consumer price index at a future date, the increase is not included in the cash flows used to determine the lease liability. Options to Extend, Residual Value Guarantees, Restrictions and Covenants Certain of the Company s operating leases offer the option to extend the lease term and the Company has included such extensions in its calculation of the lease liabilities to the extent the options are reasonably certain of being exercised. The lease agreements do not provide for residual value guarantees and have no restrictions or covenants that would impact dividends or require incurring additional financial obligations.

Net Interest Margin 
 The Company uses the net interest margin to measure profit on interest generating activities, as a percentage of total interest-earning assets. The Company s net interest margin is calculated on a fully taxable equivalent FTE basis. The portion of interest income that is nontaxable is grossed up to the tax equivalent by adding the tax benefit based on a tax rate of 21 . Annualized FTE net interest income is divided by total average earning assets to calculate the net interest margin. The following tables present the reconciliation of tax equivalent net interest income, which is not a measurement under GAAP, to net interest income, for the periods indicated.

Adjusted Return on Average Assets and Adjusted Return on Average Equity 
 The adjusted return on average assets and adjusted return on average equity are measures of profitability, calculated by annualizing net income and dividing by average year-to-date assets or equity, respectively. Larger nonrecurring income or expenses are not annualized, in order to reduce distortion within the ratios. The tables below present the reconciliation of adjusted annualized net income, which is not a measurement under GAAP, for the periods indicated.

(1) Interest on nontaxable loans and securities is computed on a fully taxable equivalent basis using a Federal income tax rate of 21 . 

(2) Included in interest income are loan fees of 44 and 56 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 

(3) Included in interest income are loan fees of 147 and 162 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 

(4) Nonaccrual loans are included in average balances for yield computations. 

(5) Includes loans held for sale. 

(6) Daily averages are shown at amortized cost. 

(7) Includes restricted stock. 

In September, 2024, the Federal Reserve cut its target interest rate by 50 basis points. This cut had an immediate impact on deposits with pricing based on the prime interest rate. Competitive pressure for deposits began in 2023 and continues to contribute to higher cost of funds and compressed net interest margin when results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 are compared with the same periods of 2023. However, the Company expects the interest rate cut to benefit deposit costs during the fourth quarter of 2024. While the interest rate cut is expected to reduce deposit costs, current interest rates are still at a level that will allow interest income and the yield on earning assets to grow as adjustable loans reach repricing dates.

Noninterest expense increased when the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 are compared with the comparable periods of 2023. Key noninterest expense changes include occupancy, furniture and fixtures, professional services, merger-related expenses, and contract termination expenses. 
 Occupancy, furniture and fixtures expense increased when compared with 2023 due to the addition of assets acquired in the FCB merger and the receipt of a one-time insurance reimbursement during 2023. 
 Professional services include legal and other expenses for the Company s response to a proxy contest from an activist shareholder during 2023, which amounted to 786 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 During 2024, the Company recorded expenses associated with its acquisition of FCB, including executive and employee severance benefits and legal and consulting fees. 
 During the second quarter of 2024, the Company recorded a contract termination expense when it gave formal notification to a vendor that it intends to end its relationship in 2025. 
 Included in various categories of noninterest expense are expenses to manage cybersecurity risk. The cost of these measures was 92 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 141 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the total cybersecurity expense was 276 compared to 424 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The Company places high priority on cybersecurity. The decrease in expense reflects renegotiation of contracts and licensing. 
 Income Tax 
 The Company s income tax expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 550. For the three months ended September 30, 2023, the Company recorded an income tax expense of 617. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company s income tax expense was 891 and effective tax rate was 16.39 . For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company s income tax expense was 2,105 and effective tax rate was 15.47 . A significant portion of the merger related expense was not tax deductible, resulting in an increase to the Company s effective tax rate for 2024. During 2023, the Company recognized a gain on the settlement of a BOLI policy that was not taxable.

For information on the Company s policies on the ACLL, please refer to the Company s 2023 Form 10-K, Note 1: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. 
 The Company s risk analysis as of September 30, 2024 determined an ACLL of 10,328, or 1.03 of loans net of unearned income and deferred fees and costs. This compares with an allowance of 9,094 as of December 31, 2023, or 1.06 of loans. To determine the 
 40 

Table of Contents 

appropriate level of the ACLL, the Company considers credit risk for individually evaluated loans and for groups of loans evaluated collectively. 
 Individually Evaluated Loans 
 Individually evaluated loans were 10,713 as of September 30, 2024, a slight increase from 10,544 as of December 31, 2023. As of September 30, 2024, four individually evaluated loans were collateral dependent but were adequately collateralized and did not result in an individual allocation. The remaining individually evaluated loans were measured using the discounted cash flow method, resulting in an allocation of 85. 
 Collectively Evaluated Loans 
 Collectively evaluated loans totaled 991,528, with an ACLL of 10,243 as of September 30, 2024. As of December 31, 2023, collectively evaluated loans totaled 846,631, with an allowance of 8,522. 
 Collectively evaluated loans are divided into classes based upon risk characteristics. Utilizing historical loss information and peer data, the Company calculates probability of default and loss given default for each class, which is adjusted for a reasonable and supportable forecast. Cash flow projections based on each loan s contractual terms are modified by the adjusted probability of default and loss given default for its class. Loan classes are allocated additional loss estimates based upon the Company s analysis of qualitative factors including economic measures, asset quality indicators, loan characteristics, and changes to internal Company policies and management. 
 Reasonable and Supportable Forecast 
 The Company applies national unemployment forecasts to project cash flows. The Company determined that 12 months represents a reasonable and supportable forecast period as of September 30, 2024, and set a period of 12 months to revert to historical losses on a straight-line basis. The forecast applied as of September 30, 2024 projects that unemployment will rise over the next 12 months to a higher level than the forecast applied as of December 31, 2023. The higher unemployment forecast increased the required level of the ACLL when September 30, 2024 is compared with December 31, 2023. 
 Qualitative Factors: Economic 
 The Company sources economic data pertinent to its market from the most recently available publications, including business and personal bankruptcy filings, the residential vacancy rate and the inventory of new and existing homes. 
 Higher bankruptcy filings indicate heightened credit risk and increase the ACLL, while lower bankruptcy filings have a beneficial impact on credit risk. Compared with data available as of December 31, 2023, business and personal bankruptcies filings increased slightly. 
 Residential vacancy rates and housing inventory impact the Company s residential construction customers and the consumer real estate market. Higher levels increase credit risk. The residential vacancy rate available as of September 30, 2024 increased from the data incorporated into the December 31, 2023 calculation. Housing data available as of September 30, 2024 showed higher inventory than as of December 31, 2023, resulting in a higher allocation. 
 Qualitative Factors: Asset Quality Indicators 
 Accruing past due loans are analyzed at the class level and compared with previous levels. Increases in past due loans indicate heightened credit risk. Accruing loans past due 30-89 days were 0.33 of total loans as of September 30, 2024, an increase from 0.19 as of December 31, 2023. 
 Qualitative Factors: Other Considerations 
 The Company considers other factors that impact credit risk, including the interest rate environment, the competitive, legal and regulatory environments, changes in lending policies and loan review, changes in lending management, and high risk loans. 
 The interest rate environment impacts variable rate loans. The Federal Reserve s substantial interest rate increases between March 2022 and July 2023 have increased and are expected to continue to increase payments on the Company s variable rate loans as they reach contractual repricing dates, despite the Federal Reserve's recent reduction in their target rate. The Company allocates additional reserve each time the Federal Reserve increases rates, under the expectation that higher payments may increase credit risk. After the rate increase has been in effect for one year, the allocation may be removed if management deems that the impact of the change has become integrated to the portfolio. As of September 30, 2024, the Company reduced its allocation from December 31, 2023 . 
 The competitive, legal and regulatory environments were evaluated for changes that would affect credit risk. Higher competition for loans increases credit risk, while lower competition decreases credit risk. Competition remained at similar levels to those at December 31, 2023. The legal and regulatory environments also remain in a similar posture to December 31, 2023. 
 Lending policies, loan review procedures and management s experience influence credit risk. Policies and procedures remain similar to those at December 31, 2023. The Company added an allocation to account for absorption of FCB acquired loans and integration of FCB lenders.

Table of Contents 

Levels of high risk loans are considered in the determination of the level of the ACLL. A decrease in the level of high risk loans within a class decreases the required allocation for the loan class, and an increase in the level of high risk loans within a class increases the required allocation for the loan class. Total high risk loans increased from the level at December 31, 2023. 
 Unallocated Surplus 
 The unallocated surplus as of September 30, 2024 is 83, or 0.81 in excess of the calculated requirement. The unallocated surplus at December 31, 2023 was 350, or 4.00 in excess of the calculated requirement. The surplus provides some mitigation of current economic uncertainty that may impact credit risk. 
 Conclusion 
 The calculation of the appropriate level for the ACLL incorporates analysis of multiple factors and requires management s prudent and informed judgment. The Company augmented the calculated requirement with an unallocated surplus. Based on analysis of historical indicators, asset quality and economic factors, management believes the level of ACLL is reasonable for the credit risk in the loan portfolio as of September 30, 2024. 
 ACL on Unfunded Commitments 
 The ACL on unfunded commitments was 241, or 0.14 of unfunded commitments as of September 30, 2024. The ACL on unfunded commitments was 259, or 0.16 as of December 31, 2023. 
 Provision for (Recovery of) Credit Losses 
 The provision for credit losses represents charges to earnings necessary to maintain an adequate allowance. The adequacy of the ACLL is reviewed quarterly and adjustments are made as determined necessary. The Company recorded a provision for credit losses on loans of 5 and a recovery of credit losses on unfunded commitments of 10 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared with a recovery of credit losses on loans of 401 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and a provision of 30 for unfunded commitments. 
 The Company recorded a provision for credit losses on loans of 1,312 and a recovery of credit losses on unfunded commitments of 25 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared with a recovery of credit losses on loans of 389 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and a provision of 21 for unfunded commitments. Upon acquisition of FCB in June 2024, the Company recorded a provision for credit losses of 1,290 to establish an allowance on non-PCD loans. 
 Loan Modifications 
 In the ordinary course of business the Company modifies loan terms on a case-by-case basis for a variety of reasons. Modifications may include rate reductions, payment extensions of varying lengths of time, a change in amortization term or method or other arrangements. Modifications to consumer loans generally involve short-term payment extensions to accommodate specific, temporary circumstances. Modifications to commercial loans may include, but are not limited to, changes in interest rate, maturity, amortization and financial covenants. 
 The Company reviews modifications to determine whether the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty, including indicators of default, bankruptcy, going concern, insufficient projected cash flows and inability to obtain financing from other sources. If a modification is made to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty, the loan s risk rating is downgraded to special mention or classified, resulting in individual evaluation for the ACLL. Please refer to Note 3: Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses in Part I, Item 1 of this report for more information on loans modified for borrowers experiencing financial difficulty. 
 Modifications for Borrowers Who Were Not Experiencing Financial Difficulty 
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company modified loans in the normal course of business for borrowers who were not experiencing financial difficulty. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company modified 205 loans totaling 42,969. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company modified 637 loans totaling 86,905. During the three months ended September 30, 2023, the Company provided 186 modifications to loans totaling 23,054. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company provided 581 modifications to loans totaling 65,089.

Securities available for sale are presented at fair value as of each reporting date. The fair value of bonds moves inversely to interest rate changes and expectations of interest rate changes. Most of the Company s securities were purchased during periods prior to the Federal Reserve s interest rate increases that began in March of 2022. The Federal Reserve's cut to its target rate in September 2024 improved the unrealized loss on securities when September 30, 2024 is compared with December 31, 2023. The Company s analysis of the securities portfolio determined no identifiable credit risk as of September 30, 2024 and no ACL has been recorded.

The increase in stockholders equity reflects the stock consideration issued to acquire FCB. The Company paid dividends to shareholders in June 2024. 
 The Company qualifies as a small bank holding company under the Federal Reserve s Small Bank Holding Company Policy Statement, which exempts bank holding companies with less than 3 billion in assets from reporting consolidated regulatory capital ratios and from minimum regulatory capital requirements. NBB is subject to various capital requirements administered by banking agencies, including an additional capital conservation buffer in order to make capital distributions or discretionary bonus payments. Risk-based capital ratios are calculated in compliance with OCC rules based on the Basel III Capital Rules. The Bank s ratios are well above the required minimums as of September 30, 2024. Capital ratios for NBB are shown in the following tables.

Liquidity 
 Liquidity measures the Company s ability to meet its financial commitments at a reasonable cost. Demands on the Company s liquidity include funding additional loan demand and accepting withdrawals of existing deposits. The Company has diverse liquidity sources, including customer and purchased deposits, customer repayments of loan principal and interest, sales, calls and maturities of securities, Federal Reserve discount window borrowing, short-term borrowing, and FHLB advances. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company had 293,379 of borrowing capacity from the FHLB and the Company had 178,582 of unused capacity at the Federal Reserve Bank discount window. Periodically during 2023, the Company accessed FHLB borrowings. The advances were fully repaid, due to the success of the Company s deposit strategy. As of September 30, 2024, the Company did not have purchased deposits, discount window borrowings or short-term borrowings. 
 44 

Table of Contents 

The Company considers its security portfolio for typical liquidity needs, within accounting, legal and strategic parameters. Portions of the securities portfolio are pledged to meet state requirements for public funds deposits. Discount window borrowings also require pledged securities. Increased/decreased liquidity from public funds deposits or discount window borrowings results in increased/decreased liquidity from pledging requirements. The Company monitors public funds pledging requirements and unpledged available for sale securities accessible for liquidity needs. 
 Regulatory capital levels determine the Company s ability to use purchased deposits and the Federal Reserve Bank discount window. As of September 30, 2024, the Company is considered well capitalized and does not have any restrictions on purchased deposits or borrowing ability at the Federal Reserve Bank discount window. 
 The Company monitors factors that may increase its liquidity needs. Some of these factors include deposit trends, large depositor activity, maturing deposit promotions, interest rate sensitivity, maturity and repricing timing gaps between assets and liabilities, the level of unfunded loan commitments and loan growth. As of September 30, 2024, the Company s liquidity is sufficient to meet projected trends. 
 To monitor and estimate liquidity levels, the Company performs stress testing under varying assumptions on credit sensitive liabilities and the sources and amounts of balance sheet and external liquidity available to replace outflows. The Company s Contingency Funding Plan sets forth avenues for rectifying liquidity shortfalls. As of September 30, 2024, the analysis indicated adequate liquidity under the tested scenarios. 
 The Company utilizes several other strategies to maintain sufficient liquidity. Loan and deposit growth are managed to keep the loan to deposit ratio within the Company s internally-set target range. As of September 30, 2024, the loan to deposit ratio was 62.49 . The investment strategy takes into consideration the term of the investment, and securities in the available for sale portfolio are laddered based upon projected funding needs. 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 In the normal course of business, NBB extends lines of credit and letters of credit to its customers. Depending on their needs, customers may draw upon lines of credit at any time in any amount up to a pre-approved limit. Financial letters of credit guarantee payments to facilitate customer purchases. Performance letters of credit guarantee payment if the customer fails to complete a specific obligation. 
 While it would be possible for customers to fully draw on approved lines of credit and for beneficiaries to call all letters of credit, historically this has not occurred. In the event of a sudden and substantial draw on these lines, the Company would be able to access multiple options, including its lines of credit with correspondents, raising additional deposits, or selling securities available for sale or loans. The Company estimates an ACL on unfunded loan commitments under the current expected credit losses model. 
 The Company sells mortgages on the secondary market. Our agreement with the purchaser provides for strict underwriting and documentation requirements. Violation of the representations and warranties of the agreement would entitle the purchaser to recourse provisions. The Company has determined that its risk in this area is not significant because of the low volume of secondary market mortgage loans and high underwriting standards. The Company estimates a potential loss reserve for recourse provisions that is not material as of September 30, 2024. To date, no recourse provisions have been invoked. If funds were needed, the Company would access the same sources as noted above for funding lines and letters of credit. There were no material changes in off-balance sheet arrangements during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Contractual Obligations 
 The Company had no finance lease or purchase obligations and no long-term debt at September 30, 2024. 
 Item 3. Quantitative a nd Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 Not applicable. 
 Item 4. Controls an d Procedures 
 The Company s management evaluated, with the participation of the Company s principal executive officer and principal financial officer, the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e)) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act as of the end of the period covered by this report. In conducting the evaluation of the effectiveness of its disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024, the Company has excluded the operations of FCB as permitted by the guidance issued by the Office of the Chief Accountant of the Securities and Exchange Commission (not to extend more than one year beyond the date of the acquisition or for more than one annual reporting period). The merger was completed on June 1, 2024. See "Note 2. Business Combinations" for further discussion of the merger and its impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements. 
 Based on that evaluation, the Company s principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures are effective as of September 30, 2024 to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that the Company files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time

periods specified by the Company's management, including the Company's principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 There were no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that occurred during the three months ended September 30, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting. 
 Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, the Company believes that no system of controls, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide absolute assurance that all control issues have been detected.

Exhibit 10(i) 
 ADVISORY SERVICES AGREEMENT 
 THIS ADVISORY SERVICES AGREEMENT (this Agreement is entered into by and between Alan J. Sweet (the Consultant and National Bankshares, Inc. (the Company as of June 1, 2024, to be effective immediately following the Effective Time (as defined in the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated January 23, 2024 (the Merger Agreement ), by and among the Company, The National Bank of Blacksburg, the Company s wholly-owned bank subsidiary (the Bank and Frontier Community Bank) (the Effective Date ). If the Effective Time does not occur, this Agreement shall be null and void ab initio and of no further force and effect.

 WHEREAS, the Consultant has valuable knowledge and expertise regarding the business of Frontier Community Bank; and 
 WHEREAS, due to the Consultant s knowledge and expertise, the Company wishes to have the cooperation of, access to, and services of the Consultant following the Effective Time. 
 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and mutual covenants contained in this Agreement, the Company and the Consultant, intending to be legally bound hereby, mutually agree as follows: 
 1. Services; Term; Termination . 

(a) The Consultant shall serve as a Special Advisor beginning on the Effective Date for a three (3)-month period, unless such period is earlier terminated in accordance with Sections 1(c) or 1(d) below (the applicable period, the Term ).

(b) To the extent that the Term is not terminated in accordance with Section 1(c) or 1(d), the Term may be extended for successive one (1)-month periods only through mutual written agreement of the parties hereto. 

(c) The Company may terminate the Term only for Cause, upon ten (10) calendar days advance written notice to the Consultant. For purposes of this Agreement, Cause shall mean the Consultant s material failure to perform the Services (other than a failure to perform the Services as a result of the Company s refusal to accept performance of the Services, the Company s failure to request the Services, or the Company s material failure to comply with the terms of this Agreement) or the Consultant s breach of this Agreement. 

(d) The Consultant may terminate the Term for any reason, at any time, upon ten (10) calendar days advance written notice to the Company. 

(e) No additional Consulting Fees (as defined below) will be paid for any period after the Term has been terminated in accordance with this Agreement.

It is understood and agreed that the Consultant shall have no power or authority to supervise, direct, or manage any employee of the Company or the Bank; to enter into contracts on behalf of the Company or the Bank; or to borrow or incur debts or liabilities, of any kind or nature whatsoever, on behalf of the Company or the Bank.
