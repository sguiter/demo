 (2) Alamance Crossing is made up of Alamance Crossing East and Alamance Crossing West. Alamance Crossing East was deconsolidated and placed into receivership in connection with the foreclosure process. Alamance Crossing West remains consolidated. The Company views Alamance Crossing as one property and therefore only Alamance Crossing West is reflected in the total count. 

 (3) Included in All Other for purposes of segment reporting. 

 (4) CBL's consolidated corporate office buildings are included in the Other category. 

 (5) The Operating Partnership accounts for these investments using the equity method. 

CBL is the owner of qualified REIT subsidiaries, CBL Holdings I, Inc. and CBL Holdings II, Inc. As of September 30, 2024, CBL Holdings I, Inc., the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership, own ed a general partner interest in the Operating Partnership and CBL Holdings II, Inc. owned a limited partner interest for a combined interest held by CBL of .

As used herein, the term "Company" includes CBL Associates Properties, Inc. and its subsidiaries, including CBL Associates Limited Partnership and its subsidiaries, unless the context indicates otherwise. The term "Operating Partnership" refers to CBL Associates Limited Partnership and its subsidiaries. The Operating Partnership conducts the Company's property management and development activities through its wholly owned subsidiary, CBL Associates Management, Inc. (the Management Company"), to comply with certain requirements of the Internal Revenue Code. The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements are unaudited; however, they have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America GAAP for interim financial information and in conjunction with the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"). Accordingly, they do not include all the disclosures required by GAAP for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting solely of normal recurring matters) necessary for a fair presentation of the financial statements for these interim periods have been included. All intercompany transactions have been eliminated. The results for the interim period ended September 30, 2024 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be obtained for the full fiscal year.

and as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The fair value of mortgage and other indebtedness was calculated using Level 2 inputs by discounting future cash flows for mortgage and other indebtedness using estimated market rates at which similar loans would be made currently. Fair Value Measurements on a Recurring Basis The Company uses interest rate swaps to manage its interest rate risk. The valuation of these instruments is determined using widely accepted valuation techniques, including discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows. This analysis reflects the contractual terms of the interest rate swap, including the period to maturity, and uses observable market-based inputs, including interest rate curves and implied volatilities. To comply with the provisions of ASC 820, the Company incorporates credit valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect both its own nonperformance risk and the respective counterparty s nonperformance risk in the fair value measurements. In adjusting the fair value of the Company's derivative contracts for the effect of nonperformance risk, it has considered the impact of netting and any applicable credit enhancements, such as collateral postings, thresholds, mutual puts and guarantees. In accordance with ASU 2011-04, the FASB s fair value measurement guidance, the Company made an accounting policy election to measure the credit risk of its derivative financial instruments that are subject to master netting agreements on a net basis by counterparty portfolio. Although the Company has determined that the majority of the inputs used to value its interest rate swap fall within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, the credit valuation adjustments associated with its interest rate swap utilize Level 3 inputs, such as estimates of current credit spreads to evaluate the likelihood of default by the Company and its counterparties. The Company has determined that the significance of the impact of the credit valuation adjustments made to its derivative contract, which determination was based on the fair value of the individual contract, was not significant to the overall valuation. As a result, the Company's interest rate swap held as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were classified as Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company has continued to reinvest the cash from maturing U.S. Treasury securities into new U.S. Treasury securities. The Company designated the U.S. Treasury securities as available-for-sale AFS ). 

Allowance for credit losses (2) 

Total unrealized gain 

Fair value (3) 

(1) The U.S. Treasury securities held as of September 30, 2024 have maturities through June 2025 . 

 (2) U.S. Treasury securities have a long history with no credit losses. Additionally, the Company notes that U.S. Treasury securities are explicitly fully guaranteed by a sovereign entity that can print its own currency and that the sovereign entity s currency is routinely held by central banks and other major financial institutions, is used in international commerce, and commonly viewed as a reserve currency, all of which qualitatively indicate that historical credit loss information should be minimally affected by current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Therefore, the Company did not record expected credit losses for its U.S. Treasury securities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, nor for the year ended December 31, 2023. 

 (3) Fair value was calculated using Level 1 inputs.

entities , which are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. All investments in unconsolidated affiliates were similar in nature and the entities all were developing or held and operated real estate assets. The Company had three unconsolidated affiliates with its ownership interests ranging from to , unconsolidated affiliates owned in 50/50 joint ventures and four unconsolidated affiliates with ownership interests of . Although the Company had majority ownership of certain joint ventures during 2024 and 2023, it evaluated the investments and concluded that the other partners or owners in these joint ventures had substantive participating rights, such as approvals of: the pro forma for the development and construction of the project and any material deviations or modifications thereto; 

 the site plan and any material deviations or modifications thereto; 

 the conceptual design of the project and the initial plans and specifications for the project and any material deviations or modifications thereto; 

 any acquisition/construction loans or any permanent financings/refinancings; 

 the annual operating budgets and any material deviations or modifications thereto; 

 the initial leasing plan and leasing parameters and any material deviations or modifications thereto; and 

 any material acquisitions or dispositions with respect to the project.

Additionally, the Company had a wholly owned investment that was deconsolidated as a result of losing control when the property went into receivership. 2024 Activity - Unconsolidated Affiliates BI Development II, LLC Subsequent to September 30, 2024, the loan secured by the former Sears parcel at Northgate Mall was paid off using proceeds from the sale of that parcel.

Variable Interest Entities The Operating Partnership and certain of its subsidiaries are VIEs primarily because the limited partners of these entities do not collectively possess substantive kick-out or participating rights. The Company consolidates the Operating Partnership because it is the primary beneficiary. The Company, through the Operating Partnership, consolidates all VIEs for which it is the primary beneficiary. Generally, a VIE is a legal entity in which the equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or the equity investors lack sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support. A limited partnership is considered a VIE when the majority of the limited partners unrelated to the general partner possess neither the right to remove the general partner without cause, nor certain rights to participate in the decisions that most significantly affect the financial results of the partnership. In determining whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE, the Company considers qualitative and quantitative factors, including, but not limited to: which activities most significantly impact the VIE s economic performance and which party controls such activities; the amount and characteristics of the Company's investment; the obligation or likelihood for the Company or other investors to provide financial support; and the similarity with and significance to the Company's business activities and the business activities of the other investors.

 The of scheduled principal payments for the remainder of 2024 represents scheduled principal amortization, as all 2024 loan maturities have been addressed. Interest Rate Hedge Instruments The Company may use derivative financial instruments, including interest rate swaps, caps, options, floors and other interest rate derivative contracts, to hedge all or a portion of the interest rate risk associated with its borrowings. The principal objective of such arrangements is to minimize the risks and/or costs associated with the Company s operating and financial structure as well as to hedge specific anticipated transactions. The Company does not intend to utilize derivatives for speculative or other purposes other than interest rate risk management. The use of derivative financial instruments carries certain risks, including the risk that the counterparties to these contractual arrangements are not able to perform under the agreements. To mitigate this risk, the Company only enters into derivative financial instruments with counterparties with high credit ratings and with major financial institutions with which the Company and its affiliates may also have other financial relationships. The Company does not anticipate that its counterparty will fail to meet their obligation. The Company records its derivative instruments in its condensed consolidated balance sheets at fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value of derivatives depends on the intended use of the derivative, whether the derivative has been designated as a hedge and, if so, whether the hedge has met the criteria necessary to apply hedge accounting. The Company s objectives in using interest rate derivatives are to add stability to interest expense and to manage its exposure to interest rate movements. To accomplish these objectives, the Company primarily uses interest rate swaps as part of its interest rate risk management strategy. Interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of variable-rate amounts from a counterparty in exchange for the Company making fixed-rate payments over the life of the agreements without exchange of the underlying notional amount.

Our focus is on continuing to execute our strategy to improve occupancy, drive rent growth and transform the offerings available at our properties to include a targeted mix of retail, service, dining, entertainment and other non-retail uses, primarily through the re-tenanting of former anchor locations as well as diversification of in-line tenancy. This operational strategy is also supported by our balance sheet strategy of reducing overall debt, extending our debt maturity schedule and lowering our overall cost of borrowings to limit maturity risk, as well as improving net cash flow and enhancing enterprise value. While the industry and our Company continue to face challenges, some of which may not be in our control, we believe that the strategies in place to improve occupancy, diversify our tenant mix and redevelop our properties will contribute to stabilization of our portfolio and revenues in future years.

Rental revenues from the Comparable Properties decreased primarily due to lower minimum rents and percentage rents in the current-year period. Minimum rents were lower due to tenant closures and tenants that converted to percentage in lieu of rent. The decline in percentage rents corresponds to the decline in tenant sales as compared to the prior-year period.

Total property operating expenses at the Comparable Properties increased primarily due to higher insurance and non-contract exterior maintenance costs. 
 Depreciation and amortization expense at the Comparable Properties decreased primarily due to tenant improvement and intangible in-place lease assets recognized upon the adoption of fresh start accounting on November 1, 2021 becoming fully depreciated or amortized since the prior-year period. 
 General and administrative expenses increased as compared to the prior-year period primarily due to higher compensation expense related to annual compensation increases and higher share-based compensation expenses related to awards granted since the prior-year period. 
 Litigation settlement expense increased during the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the prior-year period. The increase results from a revision to the estimate in the prior-year period related to amounts to be paid out under the terms of the class action settlement agreement that was executed in 2019. 
 Other Income and Expenses 
 Interest expense decreased 4.0 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the prior-year period. The decrease was primarily due to less accretion on property-level debt discounts as certain discounts became fully accreted since the prior year period. Also, the decrease is attributable to amortization of principal balances, which has resulted in a reduction in interest expense as compared to the prior-year period. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded a 19.7 million gain on deconsolidation related to WestGate Mall. The property was deconsolidated due to a loss of control when it was placed into receivership in connection with the foreclosure process. 
 Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates increased 3.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the prior-year period. The increase primarily relates to distributions received in the current-year period as compared to the prior-year period attributable to certain investments in unconsolidated affiliates in which our investment is below zero. 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized 12.8 million of gain on sales of real estate assets related to the sales of Layton Hills Mall, Layton Hills Convenience Center, Layton Hills Plaza, 10 outparcels, of which 9 outparcels were associated with the Layton Hills properties, and a land parcel. During the three months ended September 30, 2023, we recognized 3.4 million of gain on sales of real estate assets primarily related to the sale of two land parcels.

Rental revenues from the Comparable Properties decreased primarily due to lower tenant reimbursements and percentage rents. Tenant reimbursements were lower due to the accrual of credits to tenants at certain properties related to reduced assessments and refunds received from successful appeals of real estate taxes at certain properties. The decline in percentage rents corresponds to the decline in tenant sales as compared to the prior-year period.

Total property operating expenses at the Comparable Properties decreased primarily due to a state franchise tax rebate related to prior years, as well as lower real estate taxes and janitorial and security costs. 
 Depreciation and amortization expense at the Comparable Properties decreased primarily due to tenant improvement and intangible in-place lease assets recognized upon the adoption of fresh start accounting on November 1, 2021 becoming fully depreciated or amortized since the prior-year period. 
 Litigation settlement expense increased during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the prior-year period. The increase results from a revision to the estimate in the prior-year period related to amounts to be paid out under the terms of the class action settlement agreement that was executed in 2019. 
 Other Income and Expenses 
 Interest and other income increased 2.8 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the prior-year period primarily due to holding U.S. Treasury securities that carried higher interest rates in the current-year period. 
 Interest expense decreased 12.5 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the prior-year period. The decrease was primarily due to 10.2 million less accretion on property-level debt discounts as certain discounts became fully accreted since the prior year period. Also, the decrease in interest expense was impacted by higher default interest expense in the prior-year period. The decrease in interest expense was partially offset by an increase of 1.4 million in the current year period related to the term loan and open-air centers and outparcels loan due to increased variable rates. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded a 47.9 million gain on deconsolidation related to Alamance Crossing East and WestGate Mall. The properties were deconsolidated due to a loss of control when they were placed into receivership in connection with the foreclosure process. 
 Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates increased 16.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the prior-year period. The increase primarily relates to distributions received in the current-year period as compared to contributions made in the prior-year period attributable to certain investments in unconsolidated affiliates in which our investment is below zero. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 we recognized a 16.5 million gain on sales of real estate assets related to the sales of Layton Hills Mall, Layton Hills Convenience Center, Layton Hills Plaza, 10 outparcels, of which 9 outparcels were associated with the Layton Hills properties, a land parcel and an anchor parcel. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023 we recognized 4.9 million of gain on sales of real estate assets related to the sale of seven land parcels.

Non-GAAP Measure 
 S ame-center Net Operating Income 
 NOI is a supplemental non-GAAP measure of the operating performance of our shopping centers and other properties. We define NOI as property operating revenues (rental revenues and other income) less property operating expenses (property operating, real estate taxes and maintenance and repairs). 
 We compute NOI based on the Operating Partnership's pro rata share of both consolidated and unconsolidated properties. We believe that presenting NOI and same-center NOI (described below) based on our Operating Partnership s pro rata share of both consolidated and unconsolidated properties is useful since we conduct substantially all our business through our Operating Partnership and, therefore, it reflects the performance of the properties in absolute terms regardless of the ratio of ownership interests of our common shareholders and the noncontrolling interest in the Operating Partnership. Our definition of NOI may be different than that used by other companies, and accordingly, our calculation of NOI may not be comparable to that of other companies. 
 Since NOI includes only those revenues and expenses related to the operations of our shopping center properties, we believe that same-center NOI provides a measure that reflects trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, sales at our properties and operating costs and the impact of those trends on our results of operations. Our calculation of same-center NOI excludes lease termination income, straight-line rent adjustments, amortization of above and below market lease intangibles and write-offs of landlord inducement assets in order to enhance the comparability of results from one period to another. 
 We include a property in our same-center pool when we have owned all or a portion of the property since January 1 of the preceding calendar year and it has been in operation for both the entire preceding calendar year and current year-to-date period. New properties are excluded from same-center NOI until they meet these criteria. Properties excluded from the same-center pool that would otherwise meet these criteria are categorized as excluded properties. We exclude properties which are under major redevelopment or are being considered for repositioning, and where we are working or intend to work with the lender on a restructure of the terms of the loan secured by the property or convey the secured property to the lender Excluded Properties ). As of September 30, 2024, Alamance Crossing East and Harford Mall were classified as Excluded Properties. 
 Due to the exclusions noted above, same-center NOI should only be used as a supplemental measure of our performance and not as an alternative to GAAP operating income (loss) or net income (loss). 
 A reconciliation of our same-center NOI to net income (loss) for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 is as follows (in thousands):

Same-center NOI decreased 2.0 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the prior-year period. The 2.0 million decrease for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 primarily consisted of a 0.4 million decrease in revenues and a 1.6 million increase in operating expenses. Rental revenues were 0.9 million lower primarily due to lower minimum rents and percentage rents in the current-year period. Minimum rents were lower due to tenant closures and tenants that converted to percentage in lieu of rent. The decline in percentage rents corresponds to the decline in tenant sales as compared to the prior-year period. Property operating expenses increased in the current-year period primarily due to higher insurance and non-contract exterior maintenance costs. 
 Same-center NOI increased 1.0 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the prior-year period. The 3.1 million increase for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 primarily consisted of a 3.6 million decrease in revenues offset by a 6.7 million decrease in operating expenses. Rental revenues were 3.6 million lower primarily due to lower tenant reimbursements and percentage rents. Property operating expenses decreased in the current-year period primarily due to lower real estate taxes, as well as janitorial and security costs. State franchise and real estate taxes were lower due to reduced assessments and refunds received from successful appeals at certain properties, which were partially offset by increased insurance rates. 
 Operational Review 
 The shopping center business is, to some extent, seasonal in nature with tenants typically achieving the highest levels of sales during the fourth quarter due to the holiday season, which generally results in higher percentage rents in the fourth quarter. Additionally, malls, lifestyle centers and outlet centers earn a large portion of their rents from short-term tenants during the holiday period. Thus, occupancy levels and revenue production are generally the highest in the fourth quarter of each year. Results of operations realized in any one quarter may not be indicative of the results likely to be experienced over the course of the fiscal year. 
 We derive the majority of our revenues from the malls, lifestyle centers and outlet centers. The sources of our revenues by property type were as follows:

L iquidity and Capital Resources 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 307.0 million available in unrestricted cash and U.S. Treasury securities. Our total pro rata share of debt, excluding unamortized deferred financing costs and debt discounts, at September 30, 2024 was 2,486.5 million, which includes an unconsolidated property loan totaling 41.1 million that is in receivership. We had 49.9 million in restricted cash at September 30, 2024 related to cash held in escrow accounts for insurance, real estate taxes, capital expenditures and tenant allowances as required by the terms of certain mortgage notes payable, as well as amounts related to cash management agreements with lenders of certain property-level mortgage indebtedness, which are designated for debt service and operating expense obligations. We also had restricted cash of 26.5 million related to the properties that secure the corporate term loan and the open-air centers and outparcels loan of which we may receive a portion via distributions semiannually and quarterly in accordance with the provisions of the term loan and the open-air centers and outparcels loan, respectively. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we continued to reinvest the cash from maturing U.S. Treasury securities into new U.S. Treasury securities. We designated our U.S. Treasury securities as available-for-sale. In February 2024, we redeemed U.S. Treasury securities and used the proceeds to pay off the 15.2 million loan secured by Brookfield Square Anchor Redevelopment. As of September 30, 2024, our U.S. Treasury securities have maturities through June 2025. Subsequent to September 30, 2024, we redeemed and purchased additional U.S. Treasury securities. See Note 14 for more information. 
 We paid a common stock dividend of 0.40 per share in each of the first, second and third quarters of 2024. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we sold Layton Hills Mall, Layton Hills Convenience Center, Layton Hills Plaza, 10 outparcels, of which 9 outparcels were associated with the Layton Hills properties, a land parcel and an anchor parcel which generated approximately 74.2 million in gross proceeds at our share. Proceeds from the sales of Layton Hills Mall, Layton Hills Convenience Center, Layton Hills Plaza and the associated Layton Hills outparcels were used to partially paydown 46.0 million and 18.3 million on the outstanding principal balances of the secured term loan and the open-air centers and outparcels loan, respectively. Subsequent to September 30, 2024, the 3,062 loan secured by the former Sears parcel at Northgate Mall was paid off using proceeds from the sale of that parcel. See Note 14 for additional information. 
 31 

In May 2024, we exercised a one-year extension option on the loan secured by Fayette Mall and the WestGate Mall foreclosure process was completed. WestGate Mall had an outstanding loan balance of 28.7 million prior to completion of the foreclosure process. In July 2024, the loan secured by Hamilton Place Aloft Hotel was modified and extended. In August 2024, the loans secured by Coastal Grand Mall and Coastal Grand Crossing entered maturity default. Subsequent to September 30, 2024, the loan secured by Coastal Grand Dick's Sporting Goods entered maturity default. We are in discussions with the lenders regarding modifications/extensions of these loans. Also, subsequent to September 30, 2024, the loans secured by The Outlet Shoppes of the Bluegrass and Hammock Landing were paid off using proceeds from new loans. See Note 14 for more information. 
 As of September 30, 2024, our total share of consolidated, unconsolidated and other outstanding debt, excluding debt discounts and deferred financing costs, maturing during 2024, assuming all extension options are elected, is 93.1 million, and our total share of consolidated, unconsolidated and other outstanding debt, excluding debt discounts and deferred financing costs, that matured prior to 2024, which remains outstanding at September 30, 2024, is 41.1 million, consisting of a property loan that is in receivership. 
 Cash Flows - Operating, Investing and Financing Activities 
 There was 141.5 million of cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash as of September 30, 2024, an increase of 21.8 million from September 30, 2023. Of this amount, 65.1 million was unrestricted cash and cash equivalents as of September 30, 2024. Also, at September 30, 2024, we had 241.9 million in U.S. Treasuries with maturities through June 2025. 
 Our net cash flows are summarized as follows (in thousands):

Cash Provided By Operating Activities 
 Cash provided by operating activities increased primarily due to lower state franchise and real estate taxes related to reduced assessments, as well as refunds received from successful appeals, lower janitorial and security costs and increased interest income on our U.S. Treasury securities during the current-year period as compared to the prior-year period. The increase was partially offset by lower tenant reimbursements, percentage rents and increased insurance rates. Tenant reimbursements were lower due to the accrual of credits to tenants at certain properties related to reduced assessments and refunds received from successful appeals of real estate taxes at certain properties. The decline in percentage rents corresponds to the decline in tenant sales as compared to the prior-year period. 
 Cash Provided By Investing Activities 
 Cash provided by investing activities increased primarily due to the sales of Layton Hills Mall, Layton Hills Convenience Center, Layton Hills Plaza and the 9 associated outparcels. The increase was offset by a lower amount of net redemptions of U.S. Treasury securities and a lower amount of distributions from unconsolidated affiliates. 
 Cash Used In Financing Activities 
 Cash used in financing activities increased primarily due to an increase in principal payments and repurchases of common stock during the current-year period as compared to the prior-year period. This increase was partially offset by a reduction in dividends paid due to the payment of a first quarter 2023 special dividend that was declared during the fourth quarter of 2022.

Debt 
 The following tables summarize debt based on our pro rata ownership share, including our pro rata share of unconsolidated affiliates and excluding noncontrolling investors share of consolidated properties. Prior to consideration of unamortized deferred financing costs or debt discounts, of our 2,486.5 million outstanding debt at September 30, 2024, 2,437.3 million constituted non-recourse debt obligations and 49.2 million constituted recourse debt obligations.

(1) As of September 30, 2024, represents the outstanding loan balance for Alamance Crossing East. As of December 31, 2023, represents the outstanding loan balances for Alamance Crossing East and WestGate Mall. These properties were deconsolidated due to a loss of control when the properties were placed into receivership in connection with the foreclosure process. 

(2) Weighted-average interest rate excludes amortization of deferred financing costs. 

(3) The interest rate is a fixed 6.95 for half of the outstanding loan balance, with the other half of the loan bearing a variable interest rate based on the 30-day SOFR plus 4.10 . The Operating Partnership has an interest rate swap on a notional amount of 32,000 related to the variable portion of the loan to effectively fix the interest rate at 7.3975 . 

(4) In conjunction with fresh start accounting, we estimated the fair value of our mortgage notes and recognized debt discounts upon emergence from bankruptcy on November 1, 2021. The debt discounts are accreted over the term of the respective debt using the effective interest method. 

The weighted-average remaining term of our total share of consolidated and unconsolidated debt, excluding debt discounts and deferred financing costs, was 1.8 years and 2.4 years at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The weighted-average remaining term of our pro rata share of fixed-rate debt, excluding debt discounts and deferred financing costs, was 2.1 years and 2.7 years at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, our total share of consolidated and unconsolidated variable-rate debt, excluding debt discounts and deferred financing costs, represented 39.1 and 40.4 , respectively, of our total pro rata share of debt, excluding debt discounts and deferred financing costs.

See Note 7 to the condensed consolidated financial statements for information concerning activity related to unconsolidated affiliates. Subsequent to September 30, 2024, the loan secured by Coastal Grand Dick's Sporting Goods entered maturity default. Also, subsequent to September 30, 2024, the loans secured by The Outlet Shoppes of the Bluegrass and Hammock Landing were paid off using proceeds from new loans. See Note 14 for more information. 
 Equity 
 We paid a common stock dividend of 0.40 per share in each of the first, second and third quarters of 2024. The decision to declare and pay dividends on any outstanding shares of our common stock, as well as the timing, amount and composition of any such future dividends, will be at the sole discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our earnings, taxable income, FFO, liquidity, financial condition, capital requirements, contractual prohibitions or other limitations under our then-current indebtedness, the annual distribution requirements under the REIT provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, Delaware law and such other factors as our board of directors deems relevant. Any dividends payable will be determined by our board of directors based upon the circumstances at the time of declaration. Our actual results of operations will be affected by a number of factors, including the revenues received from our properties, our operating expenses, interest expense, capital expenditures and the ability of the anchors and tenants at our properties to meet their obligations for payment of rents and tenant reimbursements. 
 In September 2024, we completed all repurchase activity under our 25.0 million stock repurchase program. A total of 1,074,826 shares were repurchased under the program. Subsequent to September 30, 2024, we repurchased an additional 500,000 shares of CBL common stock, which was separate from the stock repurchase program. See Note 14 for additional information. 
 Capital Expenditures 
 The following table, which excludes expenditures for developments, redevelopments and expansions, summarizes our capital expenditures, including our share of unconsolidated affiliates' capital expenditures, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 (in thousands):

Annual capital expenditures budgets are prepared for each of our properties that are intended to provide for all necessary recurring and non-recurring capital expenditures. We believe that property operating cash flows, which include reimbursements from tenants for certain expenses, and readily available cash on hand will provide the necessary funding for these expenditures.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 Unconsolidated Affiliates 
 We have ownership interests in 25 unconsolidated affiliates as of September 30, 2024 that are described in Note 7 to the condensed consolidated financial statements. The unconsolidated affiliates are accounted for using the equity method of accounting and are reflected in the condensed consolidated balance sheets as investments in unconsolidated affiliates. 
 The following are circumstances when we may consider entering into a joint venture with a third party: 
 Third parties may approach us with opportunities in which they have obtained land and performed some pre-development activities, but they may not have sufficient access to the capital resources or the development and leasing expertise to bring the project to fruition. We enter into such arrangements when we determine such a project is viable and we can achieve a satisfactory return on our investment. We typically earn development fees from the joint venture and provide management and leasing services to the property for a fee once the property is placed in operation. 

We determine that we may have the opportunity to capitalize on the value we have created in a property by selling an interest in the property to a third party. This provides us with an additional source of capital that can be used to develop or acquire additional real estate assets that we believe will provide greater potential for growth. When we retain an interest in an asset rather than selling a 100 interest, it is typically because this allows us to continue to manage the property, which provides us the ability to earn fees for management, leasing, development and financing services provided to the joint venture. 

We also pursue opportunities to contribute available land at our properties into joint venture partnerships for development of primarily non-retail uses such as hotels, office, self-storage and multifamily. We typically partner with developers who have expertise in the non-retail property types. 

Guarantees 
 We may guarantee the debt of a joint venture primarily because it allows the joint venture to obtain funding at a lower cost than could be obtained otherwise. This results in a higher return for the joint venture on its investment, and a higher return on our investment in the joint venture. We may receive a fee from the joint venture for providing the guaranty. Additionally, when we issue a guaranty, the terms of the joint venture agreement typically provide that we may receive indemnification from the joint venture or have the ability to increase our ownership interest. 
 See Note 11 to the condensed consolidated financial statements for information related to our guarantees of unconsolidated affiliates' debt as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
 35 

Critical Accounting Policies 
 Our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our condensed consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the financial statements and disclosures. Some of these estimates and assumptions require application of difficult, subjective, and/or complex judgment about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and that may change in subsequent periods. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 
 Our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 contains a discussion of our critical accounting policies and estimates in the Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section. There have been no material changes to these policies and estimates during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Our significant accounting policies are disclosed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 Non-GAAP Measure 
 F unds from Operations 
 FFO is a widely used non-GAAP measure of the operating performance of real estate companies that supplements net income (loss) determined in accordance with GAAP. The National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts NAREIT defines FFO as net income (loss) (computed in accordance with GAAP) excluding gains or losses on sales of depreciable operating properties and impairment losses of depreciable properties, plus depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures and noncontrolling interests. Adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures and noncontrolling interests are calculated on the same basis. We define FFO as defined above by NAREIT. Our method of calculating FFO may be different from methods used by other REITs and, accordingly, may not be comparable to such other REITs. 
 We believe that FFO provides an additional indicator of the operating performance of our properties without giving effect to real estate depreciation and amortization, which assumes the value of real estate assets declines predictably over time. Since values of real estate assets have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, we believe that FFO enhances investors understanding of our operating performance. The use of FFO as an indicator of financial performance is influenced not only by the operations of our properties and interest rates, but also by our capital structure. 
 We believe FFO allocable to Operating Partnership common unitholders is a useful performance measure since we conduct substantially all our business through our Operating Partnership and, therefore, it reflects the performance of our properties in absolute terms regardless of the ratio of ownership interests of our common shareholders and the noncontrolling interest in our Operating Partnership. 
 In our reconciliation of net income (loss) attributable to common shareholders to FFO allocable to Operating Partnership common unitholders that is presented below, we make an adjustment to add back noncontrolling interest in income (loss) of our Operating Partnership in order to arrive at FFO of the Operating Partnership common unitholders. 
 FFO does not represent cash flows from operations as defined by GAAP, is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund all cash flow needs and should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss) for purposes of evaluating our operating performance or to cash flow as a measure of liquidity. 
 We believe that it is important to identify the impact of certain significant items on our FFO measures for a reader to have a complete understanding of our results of operations. Therefore, we have also presented adjusted FFO measures excluding these significant items from the applicable periods. Please refer to the reconciliation of net income (loss) attributable to common shareholders to FFO allocable to Operating Partnership common unitholders below for a description of these adjustments.

(1) In conjunction with fresh start accounting upon emergence from bankruptcy on November 1, 2021, we recognized debt discounts equal to the difference between the outstanding balance of mortgage notes payable and the estimated fair value of such mortgage notes payable. The debt discounts are accreted as additional interest expense over the terms of the respective mortgage notes payable using the effective interest method. 

(2) Represents our share of the earnings (losses) before depreciation and amortization expense of unconsolidated affiliates where we are not recognizing equity in earnings (losses) because our investment in the unconsolidated affiliate is below zero. 

(3) Represents a credit to litigation settlement expense, in each respective period, related to claim amounts that were released pursuant to the terms of the settlement agreement related to the settlement of a class action lawsuit. 

(4) The three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 includes default interest on loans past their maturity dates. 

(5) For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we deconsolidated WestGate Mall due to a loss of control when the property was placed into receivership in connection with the foreclosure process. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we deconsolidated Alamance Crossing East due to a loss of control when the property was placed into receivership in connection with the foreclosure process. 

(6) During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we made a partial paydown on the open-air centers and outparcels loan and recognized loss on extinguishment of debt related to a prepayment fee. 

The decrease in FFO, as adjusted, for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily driven by the sales of the Layton Hills properties as well as lower minimum rents and percentage rents combined with higher property operating expenses. Minimum rents were lower due to tenant closures and tenants that converted to percentage in lieu of rent. The decline in percentage rents corresponds to the decline in tenant sales as compared to the prior-year period. Property operating expenses increased in the current-year period primarily due to higher insurance and non-contract exterior maintenance costs. 
 The decrease in FFO, as adjusted, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily driven by lower tenant reimbursements, percentage rents and increased insurance rates. Tenant reimbursements were lower due to the accrual of credits to tenants at certain properties related to reduced assessments and refunds received from successful appeals of real estate taxes at certain properties. The decline in percentage rents corresponds to the decline in tenant sales as compared to the prior-year period. The decrease was partially offset by lower state franchise and real estate taxes related to reduced assessments and refunds received from successful appeals, lower janitorial and security costs and increased interest income on our U.S. Treasury securities. The sale of the Layton Hills properties also contributed to the decrease in FFO, as adjusted.

ITEM 3: Quantitative and Qualita tive Disclosures About Market Risk 
 We are exposed to various market risk exposures, including interest rate risk. The following discussion regarding our risk management activities includes forward-looking statements that involve risk and uncertainties. Estimates of future performance and economic conditions are reflected assuming certain changes in interest rates. Caution should be used in evaluating our overall market risk from the information presented below, as actual results may differ. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 Based on our proportionate share of consolidated and unconsolidated variable-rate debt at September 30, 2024, a 0.5 increase or decrease in interest rates on variable-rate debt would increase or decrease annual interest expense by approximately 4.9 million. 
 Based on our proportionate share of total consolidated, unconsolidated and other debt at September 30, 2024, a 0.5 increase in interest rates would decrease the fair value of debt by approximately 10.0 million, while a 0.5 decrease in interest rates would increase the fair value of debt by approximately 10.3 million. 
 ITEM 4: Control s and Procedures 
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 As of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report, an evaluation was performed under the supervision of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer and with the participation of our management, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 13a-15. The Company's disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms and to ensure that information we are required to disclose is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during our most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
