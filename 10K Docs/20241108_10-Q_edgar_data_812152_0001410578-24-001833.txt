 Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ). The words believe, may, will, potentially, estimate, continue, anticipate, intend, could, would, project, plan, expect and similar expressions that convey uncertainty of future events or outcomes are intended to identify forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements concerning our future financial and operating results; our business strategy of pursuing the acquisition of an operating entity; future financing initiatives; our intentions, expectations and beliefs regarding a merger, acquisition or other business combination with a viable operating entity; and our ability to comply with evolving legal standards and regulations, particularly concerning requirements for being a public company and United States export regulations. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this Form 10-Q and are subject to uncertainties, assumptions and business and economic risks. As such, our actual results could differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements It is not possible for us to predict all risks, nor can we assess the impact of all factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements we may make. In light of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, the forward-looking events and circumstances discussed in this Form 10-Q may not occur, and actual results could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated or implied in our forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements should not be relied upon as predictions of future events. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in our forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee that the future results, levels of activity, performance or events and circumstances described in the forward-looking statements will be achieved or occur. Moreover, neither we nor any other person assumes responsibility for the accuracy and completeness of the forward-looking statements. We undertake no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements for any reason after the date of this Form 10-Q to conform these statements to actual results or to changes in our expectations, except as required by law. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q with the understanding that our actual future results, levels of activity, performance and events and circumstances may be materially different from what we expect. Overview Ridgefield Acquisition Corp. we , us , our , Ridgefield or the Company was originally incorporated as a Colorado corporation on October 13, 1983 under the name Ozo Diversified, Inc. On September 23, 2006, the Company filed Articles of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada that effected the merger between the Company and a wholly owned subsidiary formed under the laws of the State of Nevada RAC-NV ), pursuant to the Articles of Merger, whereby RAC-NV was the surviving corporation. The merger changed the domicile of the Company from the State of Colorado to the State of Nevada. Furthermore, as a result of the Articles of Merger, the Company is authorized to issue 35,000,000 shares of capital stock consisting of 30,000,000 shares of common stock, .001 par value per share, and 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock, .01 par value per share. Since July 2000, the Company has suspended all operations, except for necessary administrative matters relating to the timely filing of periodic reports as required by the Exchange Act. The Company is a shell company as defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act. Accordingly, during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we earned no revenues. Our principal executive office is located at 3827 S Carson St, Unit 505-25 PMB 1078, Carson City, NV 89701 and the telephone number is (805) 484-8855. Our website address is www.ridgefieldacquisition.com. None of the information on our website is part of this Form 10-Q.

Table of Contents 
 Acquisition Strategy Our plan of operation is to arrange for a merger, acquisition, business combination or other arrangement by and between the Company and a viable operating entity. In seeking to arrange a merger, acquisition, business combination or other arrangement, our objective will be to obtain long-term capital appreciation for the Company s shareholders. While we have identified various operating entities, none have risen to the level of being a viable entity for a merger, acquisition, business combination or other arrangement. There can be no assurance that the Company will ever successfully arrange for a merger, acquisition, business combination or other arrangement by and between the Company and a viable operating entity. The selection of a business opportunity is a complex process and involves a number of risks, because potentially available business opportunities may occur in many different industries and may be in various stages of development. Due in part to economic conditions in a number of geographic areas, rapid technological advances being made in some industries and shortages of available capital, we believe that there are numerous firms seeking either the limited additional capital which the Company will have or the benefits of a publicly traded corporation, or both. The perceived benefits of a publicly traded corporation may include facilitating or improving the terms upon which additional equity financing may be sought, providing liquidity for principal shareholders, creating a means for providing incentive stock options or similar benefits to key employees, and other factors. In many cases, the management of the Company will have the authority to effect acquisitions without submitting the proposal to the shareholders for their consideration. In some instances, however, the proposed participation in a business opportunity may be submitted to the shareholders for their consideration, either voluntarily by the Board of Directors to seek the shareholders advice and consent, or because of a requirement of state law to do so. The Company may need additional funds to effectuate a merger, acquisition or other arrangement by and between the Company and a viable operating entity, although there is no assurance that we will be able to obtain such additional funds, if needed. Even if we are able to obtain additional funds, there is no assurance that the Company will be able to effectuate a merger, acquisition or other arrangement by and between the Company and a viable operating entity. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles of the United States requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in the financial statements and accompanying notes. The SEC has defined a company s critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations, and which require the company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. A description of our critical accounting policies and judgments used in the preparation of our financial statements was provided in the Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. There have been no material changes in these critical accounting policies since December 31, 2023. Results of Operations Revenues During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company earned no revenues from operations. Overall, the Company incurred a net loss of 12,902 during the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to a net loss of 12,941 during the three months ended September 30, 2023. For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, the Company incurred a net loss of 59,974 as compared to a net loss of 45,254 during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Because the Company s operations are primarily administrative, the increase in net loss relates to an increase in general and administrative (G A) expenses during the nine-month period, and additional interest expense.

Table of Contents 
 General and Administrative Expenses G A expenses consist of professional fees, service charges, office expenses and similar items. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company incurred G A expenses of 7,741, a decrease of 2,120 compared to G A expenses of 9,861 during the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease is largely attributable to the timing of professional fees related to compliance and expenses of maintaining our status as a public company. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company incurred G A expenses of 44,513, an increase of 8,772 compared to G A expenses of 35,841 during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase is largely attributable to additional compliance costs related to filing SEC reports, as well as other related costs such as legal and audit fees. Other Expense Other expense primarily represents state licenses, filing fees, minimum tax expense and net interest expense. Other expense increased to 5,161 during the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 3,080 during the three months ended September 30, 2023. Most of the increase relates to additional interest expense. The Company incurred net interest expense of 4,961 during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2,880 during the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily as a result of new borrowings. For the nine-months ended September 30, 2024, other expense was 15,461, as compared to 9,413 during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 6,048. Most of the increase relates to additional interest expense. The Company incurred net interest expense of 13,384 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 7,213 during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily as a result of new borrowings. Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and money market funds. We did not have any short-term or long-term investments as of September 30, 2024. Cash requirements for working capital and capital expenditures have been funded from cash balances on hand, loans from related parties, and issuance of common stock. As of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of 19,217 and a working capital deficit of 4,977), excluding the related party debt of 140,000. With the related party debt, we had a working capital deficit of 144,977). On March 23, 2022, the Company executed a Revolving Promissory Note (the Bronson Note ), in the principal amount of up to 200,000 payable to Mr. Bronson, pursuant to which Mr. Bronson may make loans to the Company from time to time. The Bronson Note has a maturity date of March 23, 2027, and provides for interest to accrue on the unpaid principal at a rate of eight percent (8.0 per annum (calculated on the basis of a 360-day year), compounded quarterly and payable quarterly on the last business day of the calendar quarter. The Bronson Note may be prepaid by the Company at any time without penalty. On September 27, 2022, the Company executed a Revolving Promissory Note (the Qualstar Note ), payable to Qualstar Corporation Qualstar ). Mr. Bronson is the President and CEO of Qualstar Corporation, as well as its largest shareholder. Under the terms of the Qualstar Note, Qualstar may (but is not required to) make loans to the Company from time to time upon request by the Company, up to a maximum principal amount of 200,000 outstanding at any time. The Note may be prepaid by the Company at any time without penalty and is repayable on demand by Qualstar on or after December 31, 2024. The Note provides for interest to accrue on the outstanding principal balance at a rate of ten percent (10.0 per annum (calculated on the basis of a 360-day year), compounded and payable quarterly.

Purchaser paid the purchase price for the Shares in cash. The Shares were offered and sold exclusively to Purchaser, an executive officer and director of the Company and an accredited investor, in a transaction exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ), as a transaction not involving a public offering, pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act and Rule 506 of Regulation D promulgated thereunder. Purchaser represented his intentions to acquire the securities for investment only and not with a view to or for sale in connection with any distribution thereof, and appropriate legends were placed upon the stock certificate representing the Shares issued in the transaction. The offer and sale of the Shares were made without any general solicitation or advertising. While the cash received from the sale of Shares, the Shareholder Note and the Qualstar Note will satisfy the Company s immediate financial needs, it will not by itself have the capacity to provide the Company with sufficient capital to finance a merger, acquisition or business combination between the Company and a viable operating entity. The Company may need additional funds in order to complete a merger, acquisition or business combination between the Company and a viable operating entity. There can be no assurances that the Company will be able to obtain additional funds if and when needed.

 Economy and Inflation In 2024, inflation remains elevated, though cooling from 2022 peaks, driven by persistent supply chain disruptions, geopolitical tensions, and wage pressures, impacting operational costs and consumer demand. We do not believe inflation has had a material effect on our Company s results of operations. This might not be the case if inflation continues to grow. A prolonged period of high inflation may also impact our ability to carry out our acquisition strategy. On the other hand, if business conditions deteriorate, it may be easier for us to identify an acquisition candidate. The Russian invasion of Ukraine and the resulting economic sanctions imposed by the United States and other countries, along with certain international organizations, have significantly impacted the global economy, including by exacerbating inflationary pressures created by COVID-related supply chain disruptions, and given rise to potential global security issues that have adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect international business and economic conditions. The ongoing effects of the hostilities and sanctions are no longer limited to Russia and Russian companies and have spilled over to and negatively impacted other regional and global economic markets. The conflict has resulted in rising energy prices and an even more constrained supply chain, and thus exacerbated the inflationary global economic environment, with cost increases affecting labor, fuel, materials, food and services. At this time, the ultimate extent and duration of the military action, resulting sanctions and future economic and market disruptions, and resulting effects on the Company, and our acquisition strategy, are impossible to predict. On October 7, 2023, Hamas terrorists infiltrated Israel s southern border from the Gaza Strip and conducted a series of attacks on civilian and military targets. Hamas also launched extensive rocket attacks on Israeli population and industrial centers located along Israel s border with the Gaza Strip and in other areas within the State of Israel. These attacks resulted in extensive deaths, injuries and kidnapping of civilians and soldiers. Following the attack, Israel s security cabinet declared war against Hamas and a military campaign against these terrorist organizations commenced in parallel to their continued rocket and terror attacks. The intensity and duration of Israel s current war is difficult to predict, as are such war s implications on our business and operations. Off-Balance Sheet and Contractual Arrangements Our liquidity is not dependent on the use of off-balance-sheet financing arrangements. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Not applicable.

 Item 4. Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures The phrase disclosure controls and procedures refers to controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, such as this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC. Disclosure controls and procedures are also designed to ensure that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our President and Chief Executive Officer (who serves as our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer), as appropriate, to allow timely decision regarding required disclosure. Our management, with the participation of our President and Chief Executive Officer (who serves as our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer), has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act), as of September 30, 2024, the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based on such evaluation, our President and Chief Executive Officer has concluded that as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were not designed to be effective to provide reasonable assurance that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our President and Chief Executive Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Changes in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting during the three or nine months ended September 30, 2024 that materially affected, or is reasonable likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
