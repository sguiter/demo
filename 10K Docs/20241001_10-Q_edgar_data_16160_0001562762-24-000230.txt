in damages. On August 13, 2020, the court granted the defendants motion to dismiss the State s 
original petition with 
 prejudice. On September 
11, 2020, 
the State filed a 
notice of appeal, 
which was assigned 
to the Texas 
Court of Appeals 
for the 
 First 
District. 
On 
August

2022,

appeals 
court 
reversed 
and 
remanded 
the 
case 
back 
to

for

million 
in damages. 
If the 
jury s 
decision 
is ultimately 
upheld, 
the defendants 
would 
be jointly 
and 
severally 
 liable 
for 
treble 
damages, 
or 

million, 
subject 
to 
credit 
for 
the 
Kellogg 
settlement 
described 
above 
and 
certain 
other 
 settlements with 
previous 
settling defendants, 
plus the 
Egg Product 
Plaintiffs 
reasonable 
attorneys 
fees. This 
decision is 
not 
 final and remains subject to appeals by the parties. During 
our second fiscal quarter of 2024, we recorded an accrued expense 
of 

million in selling, 
general and administrative 
expenses in the 
Company s 
Condensed Consolidated Statements 
of Income 
 and classified as 
other noncurrent liabilities 
in the Company s 
Condensed Consolidated 
Balance Sheets. The 
accrual represents 
 our 
estimate 
of 
the 
Company s 
proportional 
share 
of 
the 
reasonably 
possible 
ultimate 
damages 
award, 
excluding 
the 
Egg 
 Product Plaintiffs 
attorneys fees 
that we 
believe would 
be approximately 
offset by 
the credits 
noted above. 
We 
have entered 
 into a judgment 
allocation and joint 
defense agreement 
with the other 
major producer 
defendant remaining 
in the case, 
and are 
 in discussions 
with other 
defendants regarding 
their contributions. 
Our accrual 
may change 
in the future 
based on 
the outcome 
 of those discussions. 
Our accrual may 
also be revised 
in whole or 
in part in 
the future to 
the extent we 
are successful in 
further 
 proceedings in the 
litigation. 
On November 29, 2023, 
the defendants, including 
the Company, 
filed a motion for 
judgment as a 
 matter of 
law in 
their favor, 
known as 
a directed 
verdict, notwithstanding 
the jury s 
decision. The 
court denied 
this motion 
on 
 September 
30, 2024. 
The Company 
is evaluating 
the court s 
September 
30, 2024 
order and 
intends to 
continue 
to vigorously 
 defend the claims asserted by the Egg Products Plaintiffs. 
 State of Oklahoma Watershed Pollution 
Litigation 
 On June 
18, 2005, 
the State 
of Oklahoma 
filed suit, 
in the 
United States 
District Court 
for the 
Northern District 
of Oklahoma, 
 against Cal-Maine 
Foods, 
Inc. and 
Tyson 
Foods, 
Inc., Cobb-Vantress, 
Inc., Cargill, 
Inc., George s, 
Inc., Peterson 
Farms, Inc. 
 and 
Simmons 
Foods, 
Inc., 
and 
certain 
of 
their 
affiliates. 
The 
State 
of 
Oklahoma 
claims 
that 
through 
the 
disposal 
of 
chicken 
 litter the 
defendants polluted 
the Illinois 
River Watershed. 
This watershed 
provides water 
to eastern 
Oklahoma. The 
complaint 
 sought 
injunctive 
relief 
and 
monetary 
damages, 
but 
the 
claim 
for 
monetary 
damages 
was dismissed 
by 
the 
court. 
Cal-Maine 
 Foods, 
Inc. 
discontinued 
operations 
in 
the 
watershed 
in 
or 
around 
2005. 
Since 
the 
litigation 
began, 
Cal-Maine 
Foods, 
Inc. 
 purchased 

of 
the 
membership 
interests 
of 
Benton 
County 
Foods, 
LLC, 
which 
is 
an 
ongoing 
commercial 
shell 
egg 
 operation within 
the Illinois 
River Watershed. 
Benton County 
Foods, LLC 
is not 
a defendant 
in the 
litigation. We 
also have 
a 
 number of small contract producers that operate in the area. 
 The non-jury trial in the case began in September 2009 
and concluded in February 2010. On January 18, 2023, the court entered 
 findings of 
fact and 
conclusions of 
law in favor 
of the 
State of 
Oklahoma, but 
no penalties 
were assessed. 
The court 
found the 
 defendants 
liable 
for 
state 
law 
nuisance, 
federal 
common 
law 
nuisance, 
and 
state 
law 
trespass. 
The 
court 
also 
found 
the 
 producers 
vicariously 
liable 
for 
the 
actions 
of 
their 
contract 
producers. 
The 
court 
directed 
the 
parties 
to 
confer 
in 
attempt 
to 
 reach 
agreement 
on 
appropriate 
remedies. 
On 
June 
12, 
2023, 
the 
court 
ordered

 GENERAL 
 Cal-Maine 
Foods, 
Inc. 
(the 
 Company, 
 we, 
 us, 
 our 
is 
primarily 
engaged 
in 
the 
production, 
grading, 
packaging, 
 marketing 
and 
distribution 
of 
fresh 
shell 
eggs. 
Our 
operations 
are 
fully 
integrated 
and we 
have 
one 
operating 
and 
reportable 
 segment. 
We 
are 
the 
largest 
producer 
and 
distributor 
of 
fresh 
shell 
eggs 
in 
the 
U.S. 
Our 
total 
flock 
of 
approximately 
46.7 
 million 
layers 
and 
10.9 
million 
pullets 
and 
breeders 
is 
the 
largest 
in 
the 
U.S. 
We 
sell 
our 
shell 
eggs 
and 
egg 
products 
to 
a 
 diverse group of 
customers, including national 
and regional grocery 
store chains, 
club stores, companies 
servicing independent 
 supermarkets 
in the 
U.S., foodservice 
distributors 
and 
egg product 
customers 
throughout the 
majority 
of the 
U.S. 
and aim 
to 
 maintain efficient, state-of-the-art operations located 
close to our customers.

Our 
operating 
results 
are 
materially 
impacted 
by 
market 
prices for 
eggs 
and 
feed 
grains 
(corn 
and 
soybean 
meal), 
which 
are 
 highly 
volatile, 
independent 
of 
each 
other, 
and 
out 
of 
our 
control. 
Generally, 
higher 
market 
prices 
for 
eggs 
have 
a 
positive 
 impact 
on 
our 
financial 
results 
while 
higher 
market 
prices 
for 
feed 
grains 
have 
a 
negative 
impact 
on 
our 
financial 
results. 
 Although we 
use a 
variety of 
pricing mechanisms 
in pricing 
agreements with 
our customers, 
we sell 
most of 
our conventional 
 shell eggs 
based on 
formulas that 
consider, 
in varying 
ways, independently 
quoted regional 
wholesale 
market prices 
for shell 
 eggs 
or 
formulas 
related 
to 
our 
costs 
of 
production 
which 
include 
the 
cost 
of 
corn 
and 
soybean 
meal. 
We 
do 
not 
sell 
eggs 
 directly to consumers or set the prices at which eggs are sold to consumers. 

Index 
 18 
 Retail 
sales 
of 
shell 
eggs 
historically 
have 
been 
highest 
during 
the 
fall 
and 
winter 
months 
and 
lowest 
during 
the 
summer 
 months. Prices 
for shell 
eggs fluctuate 
in response 
to seasonal 
demand factors 
and a 
natural increase 
in egg 
production during 
 the 
spring 
and 
early 
summer. 
Historically, 
shell 
egg 
prices 
tend 
to 
increase 
with 
the 
start 
of 
the 
school 
year 
and 
tend 
to 
be 
 highest 
prior 
to 
holiday 
periods, 
particularly 
Thanksgiving, 
Christmas 
and 
Easter. 
Consequently, 
and 
all 
other 
things 
being 
 equal, we would 
expect to experience 
lower selling prices, sales 
volumes and net 
income (and may incur 
net losses) in our 
first 
 and 
fourth 
fiscal 
quarters 
ending 
in 
August/September 
and 
May/June, 
respectively. 
Because 
of 
the 
seasonal 
and 
quarterly 
 fluctuations, 
comparisons 
of 
our 
sales 
and 
operating 
results 
between 
different 
quarters 
within 
a 
single 
fiscal 
year 
are 
not 
 necessarily meaningful comparisons. 
 We 
routinely 
fill 
our 
storage 
bins 
during 
harvest 
season 
when 
prices 
for 
feed 
ingredients 
are 
generally 
lower. 
To 
ensure 
 continued 
availability of 
feed ingredients, 
we may 
enter into 
contracts for 
future purchases 
of corn 
and soybean 
meal, and 
as 
 part 
of 
these 
contracts, 
we 
may 
lock-in 
the 
basis 
portion 
of 
our 
grain 
purchases 
several 
months 
in 
advance. 
Basis 
is 
the 
 difference 
between the 
local cash 
price for 
grain and 
the applicable 
futures price. 
A basis 
contract is 
a common 
transaction in 
 the grain 
market that 
allows us 
to lock-in 
a basis 
level for 
a specific 
delivery period 
and wait 
to set 
the futures 
price at 
a later 
 date. Furthermore, 
due to 
the more 
limited supply 
for organic 
ingredients, 
we may 
commit to 
purchase organic 
ingredients in 
 advance to help ensure supply. 
Ordinarily, we do 
not enter into long-term contracts beyond a year to purchase 
corn and soybean 
 meal 
or 
hedge 
against 
increases 
in 
the 
prices 
of 
corn 
and 
soybean 
meal. 
Corn 
and 
soybean 
meal 
are 
commodities 
and 
are 
 subject 
to 
volatile 
price 
changes 
due 
to 
weather, 
various 
supply 
and 
demand 
factors, 
transportation 
and 
storage 
costs, 
 speculators, 
agricultural, energy 
and trade 
policies in 
the U.S. 
and internationally 
, 
and global 
instability that 
could disrupt 
the 
 supply chain. 
 An important competitive advantage 
for Cal-Maine Foods is 
our ability to meet 
our customers evolving needs 
with a favorable 
 mix of 
branded and 
private-label products 
of conventional 
and specialty 
eggs, including 
cage-free, organic, 
brown, free-range, 
 pasture-raised and nutritionally-enhanced eggs as well as egg products. 
 CAGE-FREE EGGS 
 Ten 
states 
have 
passed 
legislation 
or 
regulations 
mandating 
minimum 
space 
or 
cage-free 
requirements 
for 
egg 
production 
or 
 mandated 
the 
sale 
of 
only 
cage-free 
eggs 
and 
egg 
products 
in 
their 
states, 
with 
implementation 
of 
these 
laws 
ranging 
from 
 January 
2022 
to 
January 
2030. 
These 
states 
represent 
approximately 
27 
of 
the 
U.S. 
total 
population 
according 
to 
the 2020 
 U.S. 
Census. 
California, 
Massachusetts, 
Colorado, 
Oregon, 
Washington, 
and 
Nevada, 
which 
collectively 
represent 
 approximately 20 of the total estimated U.S. population, 
have cage-free legislation currently in effect. 

 A significant number of 
our customers have announced 
goals to either exclusively offer 
cage-free eggs or significantly 
increase 
 the 
volume 
of 
cage-free 
egg 
sales 
in 
the 
future, 
subject 
in 
most 
cases 
to 
availability 
of 
supply, 
affordability 
and 
consumer 
 demand, 
among 
other 
contingencies. 
Our 
customers 
typically 
do 
not 
commit 
to 
long-term 
purchases 
of 
specific 
quantities or 
 types 
of 
eggs 
with 
us, 
and 
as 
a 
result, 
it 
is 
difficult 
to 
accurately 
predict 
customer 
requirements 
for 
cage-free 
eggs. 
We 
are 
 focused 
on 
adjusting 
our 
cage-free 
production 
capacity 
with 
a 
goal 
of 
meeting 
the 
future 
needs 
of 
our 
customers 
in 
light 
of 
 changing state requirements 
and our 
customer s goals. 
As always, we 
strive to offer 
a product 
mix that aligns 
with current 
and 
 anticipated 
customer 
purchase 
decisions. 
We 
are 
engaging 
with 
our 
customers 
to 
help 
them 
meet 
their 
announced 
goals 
and 
 needs. We 
have invested significant capital 
in recent years to acquire 
and construct cage-free facilities, and 
we expect our focus 
 for future 
expansion will 
continue to 
include cage-free 
facilities. Our 
volume of 
cage-free egg 
sales has 
continued to 
increase 
 and account for a larger share of our 
product mix. Cage-free egg revenue represented approximately 
25.6 of our total net shell 
 egg revenue for the 
first quarter of fiscal year 
2025. At the same time, 
we understand the importance 
of our continued ability to 
 provide 
conventional 
eggs 
in 
order 
to 
provide 
our 
customers 
with 
a 
variety 
of 
egg 
choices 
and 
to 
address 
hunger 
in 
our 
 communities.

 ACQUISITIONS 
 During the 
first quarter 
of fiscal 
2025, 
we acquired 
substantially all 
the commercial 
shell egg 
production, 
processing and 
egg 
 products 
breaking 
assets 
of 
ISE 
America, 
Inc. 
and 
certain 
of 
its 
affiliates ISE ). 
The 
assets 
acquired 
included 
commercial 
 shell 
egg 
production 
and 
processing 
facilities 
with 
a 
capacity 
at 
the 
time 
of 
acquisition 
of 
approximately 
4.7 
million 
laying 
 hens, including 
1.0 million cage-free, 
and 1.2 million 
pullets, feed mills, 
approximately 4,000 
acres of land, 
inventories and an 
 egg products breaking facility. 
The acquired assets also include an extensive customer 
distribution network across the Northeast 
 and Mid-Atlantic 
states, and 
production operations 
in Maryland, 
New Jersey, 
Delaware and 
South Carolina. 
These production 
 assets 
are 
our 
first 
in 
Maryland, 
New 
Jersey 
and 
Delaware. 
We 
believe 
this 
acquisition 
provides 
us 
with 
an 
opportunity 
to 

Index

 significantly enhance 
our market reach 
in the Northeast 
and Mid-Atlantic states. 
See further discussion 
in 
 Note 2 Acquisition 
 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Quarterly 
Report. 
 In 
second 
quarter 
2024, 
we 
acquired 
the 
assets 
of 
Fassio 
Egg 
Farms, 
Inc.( Fassio ), 
related 
to 
its 
commercial 
shell 
egg 
 production and processing 
business. Fassio owned 
and operated commercial 
shell egg production 
and processing facilities 
with 
 a 
capacity 
at 
the 
time 
of 
acquisition 
of 
approximately 
1.2 
million 
laying 
hens, 
primarily 
cage-free, 
a 
feed 
mill, 
pullets, 
a 
 fertilizer production and composting operation and land 
located in Erda, Utah, outside Salt Lake City. 
This acquisition provided 
 us with 
an opportunity 
to expand 
our market 
presence in 
Utah and 
the western 
U.S., particularly 
for cage-free 
eggs. In 
fourth 
 quarter 
2024, 
we 
acquired 
a 
broiler 
processing 
plant, 
hatchery 
and 
feed 
mill 
in 
Dexter, 
Missouri 
that 
were 
closed 
by 
Tyson 
 Foods, Inc. in 2023 and that we are repurposing for use in shell egg and egg products production. 
 Following the end of first quarter 2025, we announced that we completed 
a strategic investment with Crepini, 
LLC, establishing 
 a 
new 
egg 
products 
and 
prepared 
foods 
venture.

 HPAI 
 Outbreaks of HPAI 
have continued to 
occur in U.S. poultry 
flocks. From the 
resurgence beginning 
in November 2023 
until the 
 last reported 
case in 
commercial layer 
hens in 
July 2024, 
approximately 33.1 
million commercial 
laying hens 
and pullets 
have 
 been depopulated. 
 During the 
third and fourth 
quarters of fiscal 
2024, we experienced 
HPAI 
outbreaks within 
our facilities located 
in Kansas and 
 Texas, 
resulting in 
total depopulation 
of approximately 
3.1 million 
laying hens 
and 577,000 
pullets. Both 
locations have 
been 
 cleared 
by 
the 
USDA to 
resume 
operations. 
Repopulation 
began 
during 
the first 
quarter 
of 
fiscal 
2025 
and 
is expected 
to 
be 
 completed before calendar year end. 
 We 
remain 
dedicated 
to robust 
biosecurity 
programs 
across our 
locations; 
however, 
no farm 
is immune 
from HPAI. 
HPAI 
is 
 currently 
widespread 
in 
the 
wild 
bird 
population 
worldwide. 
The 
extent 
of 
possible 
future 
outbreaks, 
with 
heightened 
risk 
 during the 
migration seasons, 
and more 
recent HPAI 
events, which 
have been 
directly linked 
to dairy 
cattle operations, 
cannot 
 be predicted. 
According to 
the U.S. 
Centers for 
Disease Control 
and Prevention, 
the human health 
risk to 
the U.S. public 
from 
 the HPAI 
virus is considered 
to be low. 
Also, according to 
the USDA, HPAI 
cannot be transmitted 
through safely handled 
and 
 properly cooked eggs. There 
is no known risk related 
to HPAI 
associated with eggs that are 
currently in the market and no 
eggs 
 have 
been 
recalled.

 Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations HPAI. 

 EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW 
 For the first quarter of 
fiscal 2025, we recorded a gross 
profit of 247.2 million, compared 
to 45.4 million, for the 
same period 
 of fiscal 2024, 
primarily driven by an increase in the net average selling price 
of shell eggs as well as an increase in total dozens 
 sold. In the first 
quarter of fiscal 2025, 
we sold a record 
amount of total shell eggs 
and specialty shell eggs, 
reflecting favorable 
 demand for 
shell eggs during 
most of the 
quarter. 
Our results were 
also positively 
impacted by 
lower feed costs 
and our recent 
 acquisitions discussed above.
 Our 
net 
average 
selling 
price 
per 
dozen 
for 
the 
first 
quarter 
of 
fiscal 
2025 
was 
 2.392 
compared 
to 
 1.589 
in 
the 
prior-year 
 period. Conventional 
egg prices 
per dozen 
were 2.424 
compared to 
 1.241 for 
the prior-year 
period, and 
specialty egg 
prices 
 per dozen were 2.335 
compared to 2.278 for the 
prior-year period. Egg 
prices in the first quarter 
of fiscal 2025 were elevated 
 compared 
to the 
prior-year 
period 
primarily 
due 
to 
the resurgence 
of 
HPAI 
outbreaks, 
which 
decreased 
supply, 
among 
other 
 factors. 
According 
to 
the 
USDA, 
the 
monthly 
average 
size 
of 
the 
layer 
hen 
flock 
from 
June 
through 
August 
(which 
most 
 closely aligns with 
our first fiscal quarter) 
2024 was approximately 
305 million hens, 
which was a decrease 
of 9 million layers 
, 
 or 2.9 , 
compared to 
the same 
period in 
the prior 
year. 
The daily 
average price 
for the 
Urner Barry 
southeast large 
index for 
 the 
first 
quarter 
of 
fiscal 
2025 
increased 
125.6 
from 
the 
comparable 
period 
in 
the 
prior 
year 
and 
was 
volatile 
during 
the 
 quarter 
with 
a 
low 
of 
 2.54 
and 
a 
high 
of 
 4.63 
at 
the 
end 
of 
the 
quarter. 
Subsequent 
to 
quarter-end, 
prices 
have 
dropped 
 significantly. For 
more information about historical shell egg prices, see Part I Item I of our 2024 Annual 
Report.

Our dozens sold 
for the first quarter 
of fiscal 2025 
increased 13.5 compared 
to fiscal 2024. 
We 
had an increase 
in production 
 capacity with the 
acquisitions of the 
commercial shell egg 
production and processing 
business of ISE 
during the first quarter 
of 
 fiscal 
2025 
and 
Fassio 
during 
the 
second 
quarter 
of 
fiscal 
2024, 
which 
was 
partially 
offset 
by 
the 
temporary 
decrease 
in 
 production due to the HPAI 
outbreaks at our facilities in Kansas and Texas 
during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2024. 

Index 
 20 
 Our farm 
production costs 
per dozen 
produced for 
the first 
quarter 
of fiscal 
2025 decreased 
11.7 , 
or 0.12 
compared to 
the 
 prior year period, primarily 
due to lower feed costs. Feed 
costs per dozen produced 
decreased 17.3 , or 0.10, 
compared to the 
 first 
quarter 
of 
fiscal 
2024, 
primarily 
due 
to 
lower

Our egg 
purchases and 
other (including 
changes in 
inventory) costs 
 increased 
 107.7 
million 
quarter-over-quarter, 
primarily 
due 
to 
higher 
shell

prices 
as 
well 
as 
an 
increase 
in 
dozens 
 purchased due to the loss of production caused by the HPAI

 Shell egg net sales 
 First Quarter Fiscal 2025 
vs. Fiscal 2024 
 -
 In the 
first quarter 
of fiscal 
2025, 
conventional 
egg sales 
increased 
 259.5 million, 
or 115.2 , 
compared to 
the first 
 quarter 
of 
fiscal 
2024, 
primarily 
due 
to 
a 
95.3 
increase 
in 
the 
prices 
for 
conventional 
eggs, 
which 
resulted 
in 
a 
 236.6 million increase in 
net sales, and a 10.2 
increase in the volume of 
conventional eggs sold, which resulted 
in a 
 22.9 
million 
increase 
in 
net 
sales. 
Results 
for 
the 
first 
quarter 
of 
2025 
were 
positively 
impacted 
by 
our 
recent 
 acquisitions discussed above. 
 -
 Specialty egg sales increased 48.1 million, or 
23.0 , in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 compared 
to the first quarter of 
 fiscal 2024, primarily 
due to an 20.1 
increase in the volume 
of specialty eggs 
sold, which resulted in 
a 41.9 million 
 increase in 
net sales 
and a 
2.5 increase 
in prices 
for specialty 
eggs, which 
resulted in 
a 6.3 
million increase 
in net 
 sales. 

 -
 Demand 
for 
specialty 
eggs 
increased 
in 
the 
first 
quarter 
of 
fiscal 
2025 
as 
conventional 
egg 
prices 
rose. 
Our 
sales 
 volume benefited 
as we sold 
20.1 more 
specialty eggs by 
volume in 
the first quarter 
of fiscal 2025 
versus the prior-
 year period. Additionally, 
demand continues to be impacted by 
cage-free requirements becoming effective 
for Nevada, 
 Oregon and Washington 
on January 1, 2024.

 -
 Our egg products 
net average selling 
price increased in 
the first quarter 
of fiscal 2025, 
compared to the 
first quarter of 
 fiscal 2024, as the supply of shell eggs used to produce egg products was lower due 
to the impact of HPAI 
. 
 COST OF SALES 
 Cost of 
sales consists 
of 
costs directly 
related 
to producing, 
processing 
and 
packing 
shell eggs, 
purchases 
of 
shell 
eggs from 
 outside sources, 
processing and 
packing of 
liquid and 
frozen egg 
products and 
other non-egg 
costs. Farm production 
costs are 
 those costs 
incurred at 
the egg production 
facility, 
including feed, 
facility (including 
labor), hen 
amortization and 
other related 
 farm production costs.

 Farm Production 
 First Quarter Fiscal 2025 
vs. Fiscal 2024
 -
 Feed costs per dozen produced decreased 17.3 in the first quarter 
of fiscal 2025 
compared to the first quarter of fiscal 
 2024. This 
decrease was 
primarily due 
to lower 
prices for 
corn and 
soybean meal, 
our primary 
feed ingredients. 
The 
 decrease 
in 
feed 
cost 
per 
dozen 
resulted 
in 
a 
decrease 
in 
cost 
of 
sales of 
 27.5 
million 
for 
the 
first 
quarter 
of 
fiscal 
 2025 
compared to the prior period quarter. 
 -
 For the 
first quarter 
of fiscal 
2025, the 
average Chicago 
Board of 
Trade CBOT daily 
market price 
was 4.03 
per 
 bushel 
for 
corn 
and 
 340 
per 
ton 
of 
soybean 
meal, 
representing 
decreases 
of 
24.0 
and 
19.5 , 
respectively, 
as 
 compared to the average CBOT daily market prices for the first quarter 
of fiscal 2024. 

 -
 Other farm 
production costs decreased 
primarily due 
to lower flock 
amortization. Feed 
costs reached their 
peak in the 
 second quarter 
of fiscal 
2023 and 
have since 
trended downward. 
Lower costs 
result in 
lower capitalized 
values of 
the 
 flocks during the grow out phase, which reduced amortization cost over time. 

 Current 
indications 
for 
corn 
project 
an 
overall 
better 
stocks-to-use 
ratio 
implying 
potentially 
lower 
prices 
in 
the 
near 
term; 
 however, as long 
as outside factors remain uncertain 
(including weather patterns and 
global supply chain disruptions), volatility 
 could remain. 

 Processing, packaging, and warehouse 
 First Quarter Fiscal 2025 
vs. Fiscal 2024 
 -
 Processing, packaging, and warehouse costs increased 12.0 
 
compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2024 
due to a 7.5 
 increase in the volume of processed dozens as well as an increase in costs of packaging 
materials. 

Index 
 23 
 Egg purchases and other (including change in inventory) 
 First Quarter Fiscal 2025 
vs. Fiscal 2024 
 -
 Costs in 
this category 
increased primarily 
due to 
higher shell 
egg prices 
as the 
average cost 
per dozen 
of outside 
egg 
 purchases 
increased 
71.5 
compared 
to 
first 
quarter 
of 
fiscal 
2024, 
as 
well 
as 
an 
increase 
of 
67.5 
in 
dozens 
 purchased due to the loss of 
production caused by the HPAI 
outbreaks 
at our facilities in Kansas and Texas 
in the third 
 and fourth quarters of fiscal 2024. 
 GROSS PROFIT 

 Gross profit, as a percentage of net sales, was 31.5 for the first quarter 
of fiscal 2025 compared to 9.9 for the same period of 
 fiscal 2024. 
The increase was 
primarily due to 
higher net average 
selling price as 
well as lower 
feed ingredient prices, 
partially 
 offset by the increase in volume and price of outside egg purchases 
. 
 SELLING, GENERAL, AND ADMINISTRATIVE

 Delivery expense 
 -
 The 
increased 
delivery 
expense 
is 
primarily 
due

an 
increase 
in 
dozens 
sold 
in 
the 
first

fiscal 
2025 
 compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2024. 
 Marketing expense 
 -
 The 
increase 
in 
marketing 
expense 
is 
primarily 
due 
to 
an 
increase 
in 
franchise 
fees 
as 
specialty 
egg 
sales 
increased 
 compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2024.
 Other general and administrative expense 
 -
 The increase 
in other 
general and 
administrative 
expense 
is primarily 
due 
to costs 
associated 
with the 
acquisition 
of 
 ISE assets that occurred during the first quarter of fiscal 2025 as well as an increase 
in insurance costs.
 OPERATING 
INCOME (LOSS) 
 For 
the 
first 
quarter 
of 
fiscal 
2025, 
we 
recorded 
operating 
income 
of 
 187.0 
million 
compared 
to 
an 
operating 
loss 
of 
 6.8 
 million for the same period of fiscal 2024. 
 OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE) 

 Total 
other 
income 
(expense) 
consists 
of 
items 
not 
directly 
charged 
or 
related 
to 
operations, 
such 
as 
interest 
income 
and 
 expense, equity in income or loss of unconsolidated 
entities, and patronage income, among other items. Patronage 
dividends are 
 paid to us from our membership in the EB cooperative. 

Index 
 24 
 For the 
first quarter 
of fiscal 
2025, 
we earned 
 9.9 million 
of interest 
income compared 
to 7.5 
million for 
the same 
period of 
 fiscal 2024, 
primarily due to higher average 
cash and cash equivalents and 
investment securities available-for-sale balances 
and 
 yields. 
The 
Company 
recorded 
interest 
expense 
of 
 160 
thousand 
and 
 142 
thousand 
for the 
first 
quarters 
ended 
August 
31, 
 2024 and September 2, 2023, respectively. 
 INCOME TAXES 
 For the 
first quarter 
of fiscal 
2025, our 
pre-tax income 
was 198.0 
million, compared 
to 733 
thousand for 
the first 
quarter of 
 fiscal 2024. 
Income tax 
expense of 
 48.4 million 
was recorded 
for first 
quarter 2025 
with an 
effective 
tax rate 
of 24.4 . 
For 
 first quarter 2024, 
income tax expense 
was 322 thousand 
with an effective 
tax rate of 
43.9 . The higher 
effective tax 
rate for 
 first quarter 
of fiscal 
2024 is 
primarily 
due to 
the loss 
attributable 
to our 
noncontrolling interest. 
Taxable 
income for 
the 
first 
 quarter 
of fiscal 
2024 
was 1.2 
million 
and 
excludes 
the 
loss attributable 
to 
noncontrolling 
interest 
of 
 515 
thousand, 
which 
 represents an effective tax rate of 25.7 . 
 Items causing 
our effective 
tax rate 
to differ 
from the 
federal statutory 
income tax 
rate of 
21 are 
state income 
taxes, certain 
 federal tax 
credits and 
certain items included 
in income or 
loss for financial 
reporting purposes that 
are not included 
in taxable 
 income or 
loss for income 
tax purposes, including 
tax exempt interest 
income, certain 
nondeductible expenses, 
and net income 
 or loss attributable to noncontrolling interest. 
 NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE 
TO CAL-MAINE FOODS, INC. 
 Net income 
attributable to 
Cal-Maine Foods, 
Inc. for 
the first quarter 
ended August 
31, 2024 
was 150.0 
million, or 
 3.08 per 
 basic and 3.06 
per diluted common 
share, compared to 
net income attributable 
to Cal-Maine Foods, 
Inc. of 926 
thousand, or 
 0.02 per basic and diluted common share, for the same period of fiscal 
2024. 
 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL 
RESOURCES 

 Working 
Capital and Current Ratio 
 Our working capital was 1.0 billion 
at both August 31, 2024 and June 1, 2024. 
The calculation of working capital is defined 
as 
 current 
assets 
less 
current 
liabilities. 
Our 
current 
ratio 
was 
4.1 
at 
August 
31, 
2024, 
compared 
with 
5.5 
at 
June 
1, 
2024. 
The 
 current ratio is calculated by dividing current assets by current liabilities. 
 Cash Flows from Operating Activities 
 For 
the thirteen 
weeks 
ended August 
31, 2024, 
 117.5 
million 
in net 
cash 
was 
provided by 
operating 
activities, 
compared 
to 
 23.7 
million 
provided 
by 
operating 
activities 
for 
the 
comparable 
period 
in 
fiscal 
2024. 
The 
increase 
in 
cash 
flow 
from 
 operating activities 
resulted primarily 
from higher 
net average 
selling prices 
per dozen 
as well 
as a 
decrease in 
feed ingredient 
 costs compared to the prior-year period. 
 Cash Flows from Investing Activities 
 For the thirteen 
weeks ended August 
31, 2024, 
 135.9 million 
was used in 
investing activities, primarily 
due to the 
acquisition 
 of 
assets 
of 
ISE, 
and 
purchases 
of 
property, 
plant 
and 
equipment. 
This 
compares 
to 
 80.9 
million 
provided 
by 
investing 
 activities in 
the same 
period of 
fiscal 2024, 
primarily due 
to sales and 
maturities of 
investment securities. 
Sales and 
maturities 
 of investment 
securities were 
 209.7 million 
in first 
quarter of 
fiscal 2025 
and purchases 
of investment 
securities were 
 202.2 
 million during the period. Sales and maturities of investment 
securities were 135.8 million in the first quarter fiscal 
2024 
while 
 purchases 
of 
investment 
securities 
were 
 28.3 
million 
during 
the 
period. 
The 
increase 
in 
sales 
and 
maturities 
of 
investment 
 securities is primarily due 
to the maturities of short-term 
investments during first quarter 2025. 
Purchases of property, 
plant and 
 equipment were 
 35.8 million 
and 26.7 
million in the 
first quarters 
of fiscal 
2025 and 
2024, respectively, 
primarily reflecting 
 progress on our construction projects. 
 Cash Flows from Financing Activities 
 We 
paid dividends of 37.8 
million for the thirteen 
weeks ended August 31, 
2024 compared to 37.0 
million in the same 
prior-
 year period. 

Index

 As of 
August 31, 
2024, 
cash decreased 
 56.2 million 
since June 
1, 2024, 
compared to 
an increase 
of 67.5 
million during 
the 
 same period 
of fiscal 
2024. 
The decrease 
is primarily 
due 
to the 
acquisition 
of assets 
of 
ISE during 
the first 
quarter of 
fiscal 
 2025. 
 Credit Facility 
 We 
had 
no long-term 
debt outstanding 
at August 
31, 2024 
or June 
1, 2024. 
On November 
15, 2021, 
we entered 
into a 
credit 
 agreement 
that 
provides 
for 
a 
senior 
secured 
revolving 
credit facility 
(the 
 Credit 
Facility ), 
in 
an 
initial 
aggregate 
principal 
 amount 
of 
up 
to 
 250 
million 
with 
a 
five-year 
term. 
As 
of 
August 
31, 
2024, 
no 
amounts 
were 
borrowed 
under 
the 
Credit 
 Facility. We 
have 4.7 million 
in outstanding standby

Data, Note 
10 - 
 Credit Facility included in our 2024 
Annual Report for further information regarding our long-term debt. 
 Dividends 
 In 
accordance 
with 
our 
variable 
dividend 
policy, 
we 
will 
pay 
a 
cash 
dividend 
totaling 
approximately 
 50.0 
million, 
or 
 approximately 
 1.019 per 
share, to 
holders of 
our Common 
Stock and 
Class A 
Common Stock 
with respect 
to our 
first fiscal 
 quarter 
of 
2025. 
The 
amount 
paid 
per 
share 
will 
vary 
based 
on 
the 
number 
of 
outstanding 
shares 
on 
the 
record 
date. 
The 
 dividend is payable on November 14, 2024 to holders of record on October 30, 
2024. 

 Material Cash Requirements 
 Material cash 
requirements for 
operating activities 
primarily consist 
of feed 
ingredients, processing, 
packaging and 
warehouse 
 costs, employee related 
costs, and other 
general operating expenses, 
which we expect 
to be paid 
from our cash 
from operations 
 and cash and 
investment securities on 
hand for at 
least the next 
12 months. While 
volatile egg prices 
and feed ingredient 
costs, 
 among 
other 
things, 
make 
long-term 
predictions 
difficult, 
we 
have 
substantial 
liquid 
assets 
and 
availability 
under 
our 
Credit 
 Facility to fund future operating requirements. 
 Our material 
cash requirements 
for capital 
expenditures consist 
primarily of 
our construction 
projects to increase 
our cage-free 
 production 
capacity. 
We 
continue 
to 
monitor 
the 
increasing 
demand 
for 
cage-free 
eggs and 
to 
engage 
with 
our 
customers 
in 
 efforts 
to 
achieve 
a smooth 
transition 
toward 
their 
announced 
timelines 
for 
cage-free 
egg 
sales. The 
following 
table presents 
 material construction projects approved as of August 31, 2024 (in 
thousands):

 We believe our 
current cash balances, investments, projected cash flows from operations, and available 
borrowings under our 
 Credit Facility will be sufficient to fund our capital expenditure 
cash needs for at least the next 12 months and to fund our 
 capital commitments currently in place thereafter.

 Note 1 - Summary of Significant 
 Accounting Policies 
 
of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Quarterly

 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES 

 Critical accounting 
estimates 
are those 
estimates 
made 
in accordance 
with U.S. 
generally 
accepted 
accounting 
principles that 
 involve 
a 
significant 
level 
of 
estimation 
uncertainty 
and 
have 
had 
or 
are 
reasonably 
likely 
to 
have 
a 
material 
impact 
on 
our 
 financial 
condition 
or results 
of operations. 
There 
have been 
no changes 
to our 
critical accounting 
estimates identified 
in our 
 2024 Annual Report.

 ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE 
AND QUALITATIVE 
DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 There have been no material changes in our exposure to market risk during the 
thirteen weeks ended August 31, 2024 from the 
 information provided in Part II Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About 
Market Risk in our 2024 Annual

 ITEM 4. 
CONTROLS
 AND
 PROCEDURES 
 
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Our disclosure 
controls and 
procedures are 
designed to 
provide reasonable 
assurance that 
information required 
to be 
disclosed 
 by us in the reports 
we file or submit 
under the Exchange Act 
is recorded, processed, summarized 
and reported, within the 
time 
 periods 
specified 
in 
the 
Securities and 
Exchange 
Commission s 
rules 
and 
forms. Disclosure 
controls 
and 
procedures 
include, 
 without limitation, controls and 
procedures designed to ensure that 
information required to be disclosed 
by us in the reports that 
 we file or submit 
under the Exchange 
Act is accumulated and 
communicated to management, 
including our principal 
executive 
 and 
principal 
financial 
officers, 
or 
persons 
performing 
similar 
functions, 
as 
appropriate 
to 
allow 
timely 
decisions 
regarding 
 required disclosure. Based on an evaluation of our disclosure controls 
and procedures conducted by our Chief Executive Officer 
 and 
Chief 
Financial 
Officer, 
together 
with 
other 
financial 
officers, 
such 
officers 
concluded 
that 
our 
disclosure 
controls 
and 
 procedures were effective as of August 31, 2024 at the reasonable 
assurance level. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 There 
was no 
change 
in our 
internal control 
over financial 
reporting 
that occurred 
during the 
quarter 
ended 
August 
31, 2024 
 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, 
our internal control over financial reporting.
