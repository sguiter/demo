FORM 10-Q/A FOR THE QUARTERLY PERIOD ENDED MARCH 31, 2024 TABLE OF CONTENTS Page Part I. Financial Information 4 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 4 Part II Other Information 5 Item 6. Exhibits 5 Signatures 6 3 Table of Contents PART I FINANCIAL INFORMATION Item 4. Controls and Procedures Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures As previously disclosed in the Company s annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on April 2, 2024, our management identified a material weakness in the Company s internal controls over financial reporting which existed as of December 31, 2023 due to ineffective preparation and review of the cashflow statements. In particular, during the process of preparing the financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023, our auditor identified that the Company inadvertently omitted the reclassification of the proceeds of the initial public offering of the Company, subject to redemption from supplemental disclosure of noncash investing and financing activities in the cashflow statements. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Since then, our management has taken remediation measures including without limitation, performing additional review and analyses as deemed necessary to properly present and disclose cash flows in accordance with the U.S. GAAP, as a result of which, our management reasonably concluded that such material weakness has been remediated as of March 31, 2024. Furthermore, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the quarter ended March 31, 2024, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act. Based on this evaluation, our management has concluded that during the period covered by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective. Disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial and accounting officer or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Except as set forth above, there have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended March 31, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 4 Table of Contents PART II OTHER INFORMATION Item 6.
