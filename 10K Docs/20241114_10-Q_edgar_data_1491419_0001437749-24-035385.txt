 Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) 
 For the Three and Six Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 

million as of September 30, 2024 ). As reflected in its interim unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein, the Company has a history of losses, incurred a net loss of million for the six months ended September 30, 2024 , and provided cash of million in operating activities for the six months ended September 30, 2024 and had a working capital deficiency of million as of September 30, 2024 . These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern within one year from the date that these financial statements are filed. The Company s interim unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. 

The Company s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on its ability to execute its growth strategy and on its ability to raise additional funds. The Company filed a new universal shelf Registration Statement on Form S- 3 (the New Shelf S- 3 with the SEC, which was declared effective by the SEC on February 17, 2022. Under the New Shelf S- 3, the Company has the ability to raise up to million in cash from the sale of its equity, debt and/or other financial instruments. In May 2024, the Company entered into a Sales Agreement with Roth Capital Partners, LLC ("Roth Capital"), under which the Company may offer and sell shares of our common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to million from time to time through Roth Capital acting as the Company's sales agent. As of the filing of this Quarterly Report, we have not sold any shares under such agreement. The uncertain market conditions may limit the Company s ability to access capital, may reduce demand for its services and may negatively impact its ability to retain key personnel. Management may seek additional funds, primarily through the issuance of equity and/or debt securities for cash to operate the Company s business. No assurance can be given that any future financing will be available or, if available, that it be on terms that are satisfactory to the Company. Even if the Company is able to obtain additional financing, it may contain terms that result in undue restrictions on its operations, in the case of debt financing or cause substantial dilution for its stockholders, in case of equity and/or convertible debt financing. If the Company is unable to obtain sufficient financing when needed, the Company may also have to reduce certain overhead costs through the reduction of salaries and other means and settle liabilities through negotiation. There can be no assurance that management s attempts at any or all of these endeavors will be successful. 
 
 Principles of Consolidation 
 
 The interim unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly and majority owned subsidiaries. Acquisitions are included in the Company s interim unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements from the date of the acquisition. The Company uses purchase accounting for its acquisitions, which results in all assets and liabilities of acquired businesses being recorded at their estimated fair values on the acquisition dates. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. 
 
 Reclassifications 
 
 Certain amounts in the Company s previously issued financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. 

The Company s revenue is principally derived from the following services: 
 
 Membership Services 
 
 Membership services revenue substantially consist of monthly to annual recurring membership fees, which are primarily paid in advance by credit card or through direct billings arrangements. The Company defers the portions of monthly to annual recurring membership fees collected in advance and recognizes them in the period earned. Membership revenue is recognized in the period of services rendered. The Company s membership revenue consists of performance obligations that are satisfied over time. This has been determined based on the fact that the nature of services offered are membership based where the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefit of the services provided regardless of whether the customer uses the services or not. As a result, the Company has concluded that the best measure of progress toward the complete satisfaction of the performance obligation over time is a time-based measure. The Company recognizes membership revenue straight-line through the membership period. 
 
 Membership Services consist of: 
 
 Direct member, mobile service provider and mobile app services 
 
 The Company generates revenue for membership services on both a direct basis and through memberships sold through certain third -party mobile service providers and mobile app services (collectively the Mobile Providers ). For memberships sold through the Mobile Providers, the member executes an on-line agreement with Slacker outlining the terms and conditions between Slacker and the member upon purchase of the membership. The Mobile Providers promote the Slacker app through their e-store, process payments for memberships, and retain a percentage of revenue as a fee. The Company reports this revenue gross of the fee retained by the Mobile Providers, as the member is Slacker s customer in the contract and Slacker controls the service prior to the transfer to the member. Membership revenues from monthly memberships sold directly through Mobile Providers are subject to such Mobile Providers refund or cancellation terms. Revenues from Mobile Providers are recognized net of any such adjustments for variable consideration, including refunds and other fees. The Company s payment terms vary based on whether the membership is sold on a direct basis or through Mobile Providers. Memberships sold on a direct basis require payment before the services are delivered to the customer. The payment terms for memberships sold through Mobile Providers vary, but are generally payable within 30 days. 
 
 Third-Party Original Equipment Manufacturers 
 
 The Company generates revenue for membership services through memberships sold through a third -party Original Equipment Manufacturer (the OEM ). For memberships sold through the OEM, the OEM executes an agreement with Slacker outlining the terms and conditions between Slacker and the OEM upon purchase of the membership. The OEM installs the Slacker app in their equipment and provides the Slacker service to the OEM s customers. The monthly fee charged to the OEM is based upon a fixed rate per vehicle, multiplied by the variable number of total vehicles which have signed up for a paid membership. The number of customers, or the variable consideration, is reported by OEMs and resolved on a monthly basis. The Company s payment terms with OEM are up to 30 days. 
 
 Advertising Revenue 
 
 Advertising revenue primarily consist of revenues generated from the sale of audio, video, and display advertising space to third -party advertising exchanges. Revenues are recognized based on delivery of impressions over the contract period to the third -party exchanges, either when an ad is placed for listening or viewing by a visitor or when the visitor clicks through on the advertisement. The advertising exchange companies report the variable advertising revenue performed on a monthly basis which represents the Company s efforts to satisfy the performance obligation. Additionally, following the acquisition of PodcastOne, the Company began deriving revenue from podcast advertising. PodcastOne earns advertising revenues primarily for fees earned from advertisement placement purchased by the customer during the time the podcast is delivered to the viewing audience, under the terms and conditions as set forth in the applicable podcasting agreement calculated using impressions. 
 
 From time to time the Company enters into barter transactions involving advertising provided in exchange for goods and services. Revenue from barter transactions is recognized ratably over time based on the terms of the contract as delivery of impressions is performed on a consistent basis. Services received are charged to expense in the same manner. Barter revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was million and million, respectively. Barter revenue for the six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was million and million, respectively. 

Licensing Revenue 
 
 Licensing revenue primarily consists of sales of licensing rights to digitally stream the Company s live music services. Licensing revenue is recognized when the Company satisfies its performance obligation by transferring control of the goods or services to its customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services, which is typically when the live event has aired. Any license fees collected in advance of an event are deferred until the event airs. We report our licensing revenue on a gross basis as we act as the principal in the underlying transactions. 
 
 Sponsorship Revenue 
 
 Sponsorship revenue primarily consists of sales of sponsorship programs that provide sponsors with opportunities to reach the Company s customers. Sponsorship revenue is recognized as the event airs. Any sponsorship fees collected in advance of the contract term (typically an event) are deferred until the event airs. The Company reports sponsorship revenue on a gross basis as the Company acts as the principal in the underlying transactions. 
 
 Merchandising Revenue 
 
 Revenue is recognized upon the transfer of control to the customer. The Company recognizes revenue and measures the transaction price net of taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities. Sales also include shipping and handling charges billed to customers, with the related freight costs included in cost of goods sold. Sales commissions are expensed as incurred and are recorded in sales and marketing expenses in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations. The Company s customer contracts do not have a significant financing component due to their short durations, which are typically effective for one year or less and have payment terms that are generally 30 to 60 days. Wholesale revenue is generally recognized when products are shipped, depending on the applicable contract terms. The Company records a refund liability for expected returns based on prior returns history, recent trends, and projections for returns on sales in the current period. The refund liability at September 30, 2024 and 2023 was less than million, respectively. 
 
 Ticket/Event Revenue 
 
 Ticket/Event revenue is primarily from the sale of tickets and promoter fees earned from venues or other co-promoters under one of several formulas, including a fixed guaranteed amount and/or a percentage of ticket sales or event profits. 
 
 Revenue from the promotion or production of an event is recognized at a point in time when the show occurs. Revenue collected in advance of the event is recorded as deferred revenue until the event occurs. Revenue collected from sponsorship agreements, which is not related to a single event, is classified as deferred revenue and recognized over the term of the agreement or operating season as the benefits are provided to the sponsor. 
 
 Revenue from the Company s ticketing operations primarily consists of service fees charged at the time a ticket for an event is sold in either the primary or secondary markets, including both online pay-per-view ("PPV") tickets as well as ticket physically purchased through a ticket sale vendor. For primary tickets sold to the Company s PPV and festival events the revenue for the associated ticket service charges collected in advance of the event is recorded as deferred revenue until the event occurs. For PPV arrangements that include multiple performance obligations, i.e. delivery of the online stream, sponsorships, digital meet and greet, or physical merchandise, the Company allocates the total contract consideration to each performance obligation using the standalone selling price. If the standalone selling price is not readily determinable, it is estimated using observable inputs including an adjusted market-based approach, expected cost plus margin, or the residual approach.

operating segments. We generally test goodwill for possible impairment by first performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether any triggering events have occurred during the quarter that indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. If a qualitative assessment is not used, or if the qualitative assessment is not conclusive, a quantitative impairment test is performed. If a quantitative test is performed, we determine the fair value of the related reporting unit and compare this value to the recorded net assets of the reporting unit, including goodwill. The fair value of our reporting unit is determined using an income approach based on a discounted cash flow model. In the event the recorded net assets of the reporting unit exceed the estimated fair value of such assets, an impairment charge is recorded. Due to change in terms of our agreement with our largest OEM customer, we determined that a triggering event had occurred within the reporting unit. Based on the discounted cash flows calculated for the Audio Group - Slacker operations segment being greater than the net assets of the segment, impairments of goodwill were identified in the six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. We concluded that there was no impairment for the six months ended September 30, 2024 based on an evaluation, on the basis of the weight of the evidence, of the significance of all identified events and circumstances that could affect the significant inputs used to determine the fair value of goodwill for determining whether it is more likely than not that goodwill is impaired. We prepared our estimate of the fair value of goodwill using certain inputs and information that is available to us at this time. Such inputs and information include the percentage and timing at which users of our OEM customer convert to our service and the service plan selected by such converting users. There can be no assurance that such inputs will not be revised as more information is obtained. Additionally, there can be no assurance that such revised inputs, if any, will not result in management s determination that an impairment has occurred at that time. We will continue to assess goodwill for potential impairment in future periods as more information on the inputs becomes available. At September 30, 2024, the amount of goodwill allocated to reporting units with negative net assets was as follows: Slacker, million. 
 
 We test our acquired trademarks and trade names for possible impairment by applying the same process as for goodwill. In the instance when a qualitative test is not performed or is inconclusive, a quantitative test is performed by using a discounted cash flow model to estimate fair value of our acquired trademarks and trade names. Due to change in terms of our agreement with our largest OEM customer, we determined that a triggering event had occurred within the reporting unit. Based on the discounted cash flows calculated for the Audio Group - Slacker operations segment being greater than the carrying value of the trademarks and trade names, no impairments of acquired trademarks and trade names were identified in the six months ended September 30, 2024. We concluded that there was no impairment for the six months ended September 30, 2024 based on an evaluation, on the basis of the weight of the evidence, of the significance of all identified events and circumstances that could indicate that the carrying value of the indefinite-lived assets is not recoverable and that that could affect the significant inputs used to determine the fair value of the indefinite-lived assets for determining whether it is more likely than not that the indefinite-lived assets are impaired. We prepared our estimate of the fair value of the indefinite-lived assets using certain inputs and information that is available to us at this time. Such inputs and information include the percentage and timing at which users of our OEM customer convert to our service and the service plan selected by such converting users. There can be no assurance that such inputs will not be revised as more information is obtained. Additionally, there can be no assurance that such revised inputs, if any, will not result in management s determination that an impairment has occurred at that time.

 The Company reviews all finite lived intangible assets for impairment when circumstances indicate that their carrying values may not be recoverable. If the carrying value of an asset group is not recoverable, the Company recognizes an impairment loss for the excess carrying value over the fair value in its consolidated statements of operations. In our assessment for potential impairment we identified triggering events due to the events resulting from the change in terms with our largest OEM customer. We performed a quantitative assessment using the guidance in ASC 360 and we concluded that there was impairment for the three months ended September 30, 2024 based on an evaluation, on the basis of the weight of the evidence, of the significance of all identified events and circumstances that could indicate that the carrying value of the long-lived assets is not recoverable and that could affect the significant inputs used to determine the fair value of the long-lived assets. We prepared our estimate of the fair value of the long-lived assets using certain inputs and information that is available to us at this time. Such inputs and information include the percentage and timing at which users of our OEM customer convert to our service and the service plan selected by such converting users. There can be no assurance that such inputs will not be revised as more information is obtained. Additionally, there can be no assurance that such revised inputs, if any, will not result in management s determination that an impairment has occurred at that time. We will continue to assess the long-lived assets for potential impairment in future periods as more information on the inputs becomes available. We recorded an impairment of million and none for the six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. We noted no impairment that needed to be recorded for the three months ended September 30, 2023.

In accordance with ASC 480, the Company classified million of its Series A Preferred Stock as temporary equity due to the Company s obligation to redeem million of the Series A Preferred Stock on or before 18 months after issuance for cash, which also contains a substantive conversion feature. The redemption feature was not deemed to be closely and clearly related to the equity-type host instrument. Accordingly, it was accounted for as a liability at inception based on its fair value of million with subsequent changes in fair value included in earnings. 
 
 On the Effective Date, the Company entered into Letter Agreements (collectively, the Agreements with (i) Harvest Small Cap Partners Master, Ltd. HSCPM ), (ii) Harvest Small Cap Partners, L.P.

The derivative associated with the mezzanine equity was extinguished and a gain was recognized for the six months ended September 30, 2024 in the amount of million.

The Company concluded that the Series A Preferred Stock is more akin to an equity-type instrument than a debt-type instrument, therefore the conversion features associated with the Series A preferred stock classified as permanent equity were deemed to be clearly and closely related to the host instrument and not a derivative under ASC 815. Accordingly, the Series A Preferred Stock was not accreted to the redemption amount in effect on the balance sheet date.

Non- 
 Controlling 
 Interest 

On September 8, 2023, the Company completed its spin out of PodcastOne from the Company with PodcastOne becoming a standalone publicly trading company (the "Spin-Out"), as a result of which million shares of PodcastOne common stock were issued to holders outside of the Company resulting in a non-controlling interest in PodcastOne of . The stock dividend of million shares was a non-reciprocal transfer between PodcastOne and non-LiveOne shareholders. As a result, the transaction was recorded as a change in non-controlling interest under ASC 810, which resulted in an increase to non-controlling interest of million. In the Spin-Out, PodcastOne issued an additional million shares to non-LVO holders primarily from the conversion of the PC1 Bridge Loan which resulted in a non-controlling interest of , resulting in an increase of million to non-controlling interest within the accompanying condensed consolidated statement of stockholders' deficit and mezzanine equity during the year ended March 31, 2024 . In addition, as a result of the completion of the Spin-Out and the PodcastOne shares of common stock being publicly traded, the variability in the terms of the warrants issued as part of the PC1 Bridge Loan was resolved so that the warrants issued to purchase PodcastOne's common stock were reclassified to equity and classified within non-controlling interest in the amount of million during the year ended March 31, 2024 . The Company had a non-controlling interest of as of September 30, 2024 . 

Beginning in the second quarter of Fiscal 2024, management has determined that the Company has three operating segments (PodcastOne, Slacker and Media Group). The Audio Group consists of the Company's PodcastOne and Slacker subsidiaries and the Media Group consists of the Company's remaining subsidiaries. As a result of the Spin-Out of PodcastOne, the Company s chief operating decision maker CODM began to make decisions and allocate resources based on three operating segments of the business (PodcastOne, Slacker and Media group). The Company s operating segments reflects the manner in which its CODM reviews results and allocates resources. The CODM reviews operating segment performance exclusive of share-based compensation expense, amortization of intangible assets, depreciation, and other expenses (including legal fees, expenses, and accruals) related to acquisitions, associated integration activities, and certain other non-cash charges. As a result, the segment information for the prior periods has been recast to conform with the current period presentation. 
 
 The Company s three operating segments are also consistent with its internal organizational structure, which is the way the Company assesses operating performance and allocates resources.

Overview of the Company 
 
 We are a pioneer in the acquisition, distribution and monetization of live music, Internet radio, podcasting and music-related streaming and video content. Our principal operations and decision-making functions are located in North America. We manage and report our businesses as a single operating segment. Our senior management regularly reviews our operating results, principally to make decisions about how we allocate our resources and to measure our segment and consolidated operating performance. In prior fiscal years we generated a majority of our revenue primarily through membership services from our streaming radio and music services and to a lesser extent, through advertising and licensing across our music platform. In the fourth quarter of our fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, we began generating ticketing, sponsorship and promotion-related revenue from live music events through our February 2020 acquisition of React Presents. In May 2020, we launched a new pay-per-view PPV offering enabling new forms of artist revenue including digital tickets, tipping, digital meet and greets, merchandise sales and sponsorship. In July 2020, we entered the podcasting business with the acquisition of PodcastOne and in December 2020, we entered the merchandising business with the acquisition of CPS. Through the operations of our DayOne Music Publishing, Drumify and Splitmind subsidiaries, we operate our music publishing and artist and brand development businesses. 
 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we reported revenue of 32.6 million and 28.5 million, respectively. We have one customer that accounted for more than 10 of its revenue during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The customer is an original equipment manufacturer (the OEM who provides premium Slacker service in all of their new vehicles. In the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, total revenue from the OEM was 18.5 million and 14.8 million, respectively. 
 
 Key Corporate Developments for the Quarter Ended September 30, 2024 
 
 We ended the September 30, 2024 quarter with approximately 3,100,000 paid members on our music platform, up from approximately 2,400,000 at September 30, 2023, representing 27 annual growth. Included in the total number of paid members for the reported periods are certain members which are the subject of a contractual dispute. We are currently not recognizing revenue related to these members. 
 
 On October 1, 2024, we announced an amended relationship with our largest OEM customer. Effective December 1, 2024, the OEM customer will no longer subsidize our products to some of its customers, however, we will offer all OEM customer vehicles in North America the opportunity to convert to become direct subscribers of our LiveOne music app. The direct subscription to our LiveOne app will allow such users for the first time to access their LiveOne music and LiveOne s other service offerings directly across all of their devices. Our LiveOne music streaming button/icon, which allows users to directly connect their subscription to LiveOne, is expected to remain in the OEM customer s music streaming services dashboard in perpetuity. The OEM customer will continue to pay us monthly for grandfathered vehicles for the term of the OEM license agreement. 
 
 Basis of Presentation 
 
 The following discussion and analysis of our business and results of operations and our financial conditions is presented on a consolidated basis. In addition, a brief description is provided of significant transactions and events that have an impact on the comparability of the results being analyzed. 
 
 Opportunities, Challenges and Risks 
 
 During our fiscal year ended March 31, 2024, we derived 57 of our revenue from paid memberships and the remainder from advertising, ticketing, sponsorship, merchandising and licensing. Our revenue for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024 was comprised of 57 from paid members, 40 from advertising and 3 from merchandise. 
 
 We believe our operating results and performance are, and will continue to be, driven by various factors that affect the music industry. Our ability to attract, grow and retain users to our platform is highly sensitive to rapidly changing public music preferences and technology and is dependent on our ability to maintain the attractiveness of our platform, content and reputation to our customers. Beyond fiscal year 2024, the future revenue and operating growth across our music platform will rely heavily on our ability to grow our member base in a cost effective manner, continue to develop and deploy quality and innovative new music services, provide unique and attractive content to our customers, continue to grow the number of listeners on our platform and live music festivals we stream, grow and retain customers and secure sponsorships to facilitate future revenue growth from advertising and e-commerce across our platform. 
 
 As our music platform continues to evolve, we believe there are opportunities to expand our services by adding more content in a greater variety of formats such as podcasts and video podcasts, extending our distribution to include pay television, OTT and social channels, deploying new services for our members, artist merchandise and live music event ticket sales, and licensing user data across our platform. Our acquisitions of PodcastOne and CPS are reflective of our flywheel operating model. Conversely, the evolution of technology presents an inherent risk to our business. Today, we see large opportunities to expand our music services within North America and other parts of the world where we will need to make substantial investments to improve our current service offerings. As a result, and during the fiscal year ending March 31, 2025, we will continue to invest in product and engineering to further develop our future music apps and services, and we expect to continue making significant product development investments to our existing technology solutions over the next 12 to 24 months to address these opportunities. 
 
 On October 1, 2024, we announced an amended relationship with our largest OEM customer. Effective December 1, 2024, the OEM customer will no longer subsidize our products to some of its customers, however, we will offer all OEM customer vehicles in North America the opportunity to convert to become direct subscribers of our LiveOne music app. The direct subscription to our LiveOne app will allow such users for the first time to access their LiveOne music and LiveOne s other service offerings directly across all of their devices. Our LiveOne music streaming button/icon, which allows users to directly connect their subscription to LiveOne, is expected to remain in the OEM customer s music streaming services dashboard in perpetuity. As a result, we believe that we now have a unique opportunity to convert as many of such OEM s drivers as possible to a higher priced LiveOne subscription service creating a meaningful upside opportunity for us, and we are working in good faith with such OEM customer to convert as many of these drivers as possible. The OEM customer will continue to pay us monthly for grandfathered vehicles for the term of the OEM license agreement. 
 
 As our platform matures, we also expect our Contribution Margins , adjusted earnings before income tax, depreciation and amortization Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margins to improve in the near and long term, which are non-GAAP measures as defined in section following below titled, Non-GAAP Measures . Historically, our live events business has not generated enough direct revenue to cover the costs to produce such events, and as a result generated negative Contribution Margins , Adjusted EBITDA , Adjusted EBITDA Margins and operating losses. Historically, we produced and digitally distributed the live music performances of many of these large global music events to fans all around the world. 
 
 Growth in our music services is also dependent upon our ability to convert as many of the OEM drivers as possible to become direct subscribers of our LiveOne app, the number of customers that use and pay for our services, the attractiveness of our music platform to sponsors and advertisers and our ability to negotiate favorable economic terms with music labels, publishers, artists and/or festival owners, and the number of consumers who use our services. Growth in our margins is heavily dependent on our ability to convert as many of the OEM drivers as possible to become direct subscribers of our LiveOne app and to otherwise grow our membership base in a cost-efficient manner, coupled with the managing the costs associated with implementing and operating our services, including the costs of licensing music with the music labels, producing, streaming and distributing video and audio content and sourcing and distributing personalized products and gifts. Our ability to attract and retain new and existing customers will be highly dependent on our ability to convert as many of the OEM drivers as possible to become direct subscribers of our LiveOne app and to implement and continually improve upon our technology and services on a timely basis and continually improve our network and operations as technology changes and as we experience increased network capacity constraints as we continue to grow. 
 
 For the quarter ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, all material amounts of our revenue were derived from customers located in the United States and moreover, our largest OEM customer accounted for 57 and 51 of our consolidated revenue, respectively. This significant concentration of revenue from one customer poses risks to our operating results, and any change in the means this customer utilizes our services beyond September 30, 2024 could cause our revenue to fluctuate significantly. 
 
 Moreover, and with the addition of PodcastOne and CPS in July and December 2020, respectively, the percentage of this customer revenue concentration increased and is expected to continue in the future. In the long term, we plan to expand our business internationally in places such as Europe, Asia Pacific and Latin America, and as a result will continue to incur significant incremental upfront expenses associated with these growth opportunities.

 Product development expenses decreased by 0.4 million, or 17 , to 2.2 million for the six months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 2.7 million for the six months ended September 30, 2023, which was driven by a decrease in employees as compared to the prior year. 
 
 General and Administrative 
 
 General and administrative expenses increased by 30,000, or 0 , to 11.8 million for the six months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 11.8 million for the six months ended September 30, 2023, largely due to an increase in share-based compensation of 1.2 million offset by a 1.2 million decrease in cost attributed to accounting, license and payroll. 
 
 Impairment of Intangible Assets 
 
 Impairment of intangible assets increased 0.2 million, or 100 , to 0.2 million for the six months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to none for the six months ended September 30, 2023, which is attributed to the impairment of intangible assets of PodcastOne, see Note 5 Goodwill and Intangible Assets to our condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report. 
 
 A mortization of Intangible Assets 
 
 Amortization of intangible assets increased by 0.4 million, or 62 , to 1.1 million for the six months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 0.7 million for the six months ended September 30, 2023.

Non-GAAP Measures 
 
 Contribution Margin 
 
 Contribution Margin is a non-GAAP financial measure defined as Revenue less Cost of Sales. 
 
 Adjusted EBITDA 
 
 Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure that we define as net income (loss) before (a) non-cash GAAP purchase accounting adjustments for certain deferred revenue and costs, (b) legal, accounting and other professional fees directly attributable to acquisition activity, (c) employee severance payments and third party professional fees directly attributable to acquisition or corporate realignment activities, (d) certain non-recurring expenses associated with legal settlements or reserves for legal settlements in the period that pertain to historical matters that existed at acquired companies prior to their purchase date, (e) depreciation and amortization (including goodwill impairment, if any), and (f) certain stock-based compensation expense. We use Adjusted EBITDA to evaluate the performance of our operating segment. We believe that information about Adjusted EBITDA assists investors by allowing them to evaluate changes in the operating results of our business separate from non-operational factors that affect net income (loss), thus providing insights into both operations and the other factors that affect reported results. Adjusted EBITDA is not calculated or presented in accordance with GAAP. A limitation of the use of Adjusted EBITDA as a performance measure is that it does not reflect the periodic costs of certain amortizing assets used in generating revenue in our business. Accordingly, Adjusted EBITDA should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, operating income (loss), net income (loss), and other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with GAAP. Furthermore, this measure may vary among other companies; thus, Adjusted EBITDA as presented herein may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. 
 
 Adjusted EBITDA Margin 
 
 Adjusted EBITDA Margin is a non-GAAP financial measure that we define as the ratio of Adjusted EBITDA to Revenue.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 Current Financial Condition 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, our principal sources of liquidity were our cash and cash equivalents, including restricted cash balances in the amount of 11.1 million, which primarily are invested in cash in banking institutions in the U.S. The vast majority of our cash proceeds were received as a result of our operations, incurrence of debt, the issuance of convertible notes and public offerings of our common shares. As of September 30, 2024, we have a senior secured line of credit of 7.0 million, the Capchase Loan (as defined below) of 1.0 million and an SBA loan balance of 0.1 million. 
 
 As reflected in our condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report, we have a history of losses and incurred a net loss of 3.4 million for the six months ended September 30, 2024, and cash provided by operating activities of 7.1 million for the six months ended September 30, 2024 and had a working capital deficiency of 22.3 million as of September 30, 2024. These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern within one year from the date that the financial statements are issued. Our condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on our ability to execute our strategy and on our ability to raise additional funds through the sale of equity and/or debt securities via public and/or private offerings. 
 
 On October 1, 2024, we announced an amended relationship with our largest OEM customer. Effective December 1, 2024, the OEM customer will no longer subsidize our products to some of its customers, however, we will offer all OEM customer vehicles in North America the opportunity to convert to become direct subscribers of our LiveOne music app. The direct subscription to our LiveOne app will allow such users for the first time to access their LiveOne music and LiveOne s other service offerings directly across all of their devices. Our LiveOne music streaming button/icon, which allows users to directly connect their subscription to LiveOne, is expected to remain in the OEM customer s music streaming services dashboard in perpetuity. The OEM customer will continue to pay us monthly for grandfathered vehicles for the term of the OEM license agreement. Accordingly, the change in our relationship with the OEM customer in October 2024 is likely to cause our liquidity and cash flows to fluctuate significantly beyond September 30, 2024. Our liquidity will dependent upon our ability to convert as many of the OEM drivers as possible to become direct subscribers of our LiveOne app and the OEM customer continuing to pay for any grandfather users, as well as our ability to enter into new B2B agreements to provide our services that could materially contribute to our liquidity and cash flows. In addition, our liquidity will depend on our ability to negotiate with our music labels, publishers and other partners to achieve flexibility in the terms of our license agreements to match our OEM driver conversions. Furthermore, our liquidity will be dependent on our ability to extend and/or refinance the terms of our senior secured line of credit and/or our ability to pay any amounts that we have agreed to pay under the SX Settlement Agreement. 
 
 Our long-term ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to increase revenue, reduce costs, achieve a satisfactory level of profitable operations, and obtain additional sources of suitable and adequate financing. Our ability to continue as a going concern is also dependent its ability to further develop and execute on our business plan. We may also have to reduce certain overhead costs through the reduction of salaries and other means and settle liabilities through negotiation. There can be no assurance that management s attempts at any or all of these endeavors will be successful. 
 
 Sources of Liquidity 
 
 In July 2022, PodcastOne completed a private placement offering (the PC1 Bridge Loan of its unsecured convertible notes with an original issue discount of 10 (the OID in the aggregate principal amount of 8.8 million (the PC1 Notes to certain accredited investors and institutional investors (collectively, the Purchasers ), for gross proceeds of 8,035,000 pursuant to the Subscription Agreements entered into with the Purchasers. In connection with the sale of the PC1 Notes, the Purchasers received warrants (the PC1 Warrants to purchase a number of shares of PodcastOne s common stock, par value 0.00001 per share (See Note 8 PodcastOne Bridge Loan). As part of the PC1 Bridge Loan, we purchased 3,000,000 (excluding the OID) worth of PC1 Notes. As of September 30, 2024 all of the PC1 Bridge Loan has been converted into common stock of PodcastOne. 
 
 In August 2023, we entered into a Loan and Security Agreement with Capchase Inc. Capchase pursuant to which we borrowed 1.7 million to further develop and acquire certain podcasts acquired by PodcastOne and for general working capital (the "Capchase Loan"). The Capchase Loan is subordinated to the ABL Credit Facility and bears an interest rate of 9 , which is included in the monthly amortization payments of approximately 73,100, with the final amortization payment due on February 4, 2026. (See Note 7 Notes Payable). 
 
 Our cash flows from operating activities are significantly affected by our cash-based investments in our operations, including acquiring live music events and festivals rights, our working capital, and corporate infrastructure to support our ability to generate revenue and conduct operations through cost of services, product development, sales and marketing and general and administrative activities. Cash used in investing activities has historically been, and is expected to be, impacted significantly by our investments in business combinations, our platform, and our infrastructure and equipment for our business offerings, and sale of our investments. We expect to make additional strategic acquisitions to further grow our business, which may require significant investments, capital raising and/or acquisition of additional debt in the near and long term. Over the next twelve to eighteen months, our net use of our working capital could be substantially higher or lower depending on the number and timing of new live festivals and paid members that we add to our businesses.

Table of Contents 

Subject to applicable limitations in the instruments governing our outstanding indebtedness, we may from time to time repurchase our debt, including the unsecured convertible notes, in the open market, through tender offers, through exchanges for debt or equity securities, in privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. 
 
 In the future, we may utilize additional commercial financings, bonds, notes, debentures, lines of credit and term loans with a syndicate of commercial banks or other bank syndicates and/or issue equity securities (publicly or privately) for general corporate purposes, including acquisitions and investing in our intangible assets, music equipment, platform and technologies. We may also use our current cash and cash equivalents to repurchase some or all of our unsecured convertible notes, and pay down our debt, in part or in full, subject to repayment limitation set forth in the credit agreement. Management plans to fund its operations over the next twelve months through the combination of improved operating results, spending rationalization, and the ability to access sources of capital such as through the issuance of equity and/or debt securities. No assurance can be given that any future financing will be available or, if available, that it will be on terms that are satisfactory to us. We filed a new universal shelf Registration Statement on Form S-3 (the New Shelf S-3 with the SEC, which was declared effective by the SEC on February 17, 2022. Under the New Shelf S-3, we have the ability to raise up to 150.0 million in cash from the sale of our equity, debt and/or other financial instruments.

 As of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report, we carried out an evaluation (the Evaluation ), under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act) pursuant to Rule 13a-15 of the Exchange Act. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective.

Limitations of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to reasonably ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance that it will detect or uncover failures within the Company to disclose material information otherwise required to be set forth in our periodic reports. Inherent limitations to any system of disclosure controls and procedures include, but are not limited to, the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of such controls by one or more persons. In addition, we have designed our system of controls based on certain assumptions, which we believe are reasonable, about the likelihood of future events, and our system of controls may therefore not achieve its desired objectives under all possible future events. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting, during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 
 CEO and CFO Certifications 
 
 Exhibits 31.1 and 31.2 to this Quarterly Report are the Certifications of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, respectively. These Certifications are required in accordance with Section 302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (the Section 302 Certifications ). This Item 4 of this Quarterly Report, which you are currently reading, is the information concerning the Evaluation referred to above and in the Section 302 Certifications and this information should be read in conjunction with the Section 302 Certifications for a more complete understanding of the topics presented.

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings. 
 
 We are from time to time, party to various legal proceedings arising out of our business. Certain legal proceedings in which we are involved are discussed in Note 13 - Commitments and Contingencies, to the condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report, and are incorporated herein by reference. Litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, and an adverse result in these or other matters may have, individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or operating results. 
 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors. 
 
 We operate in a rapidly changing environment that involves a number of risks, which could materially affect our business, financial condition or future results, some of which are beyond our control. In addition to the other information set forth in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the risks and uncertainties that we believe are most important for you to consider are discussed in Part I-Item 1A under the heading Risk Factors in our Annual Report. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, there were no material changes to the risk factors that were disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2024 except as noted below 
 
 Risks Related to Our Business and Industry 
 
 We rely on our largest OEM customer for a substantial percentage of our revenue. The loss of our largest OEM customer or the significant reduction of business or growth of business from such customer could significantly adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 Our business is dependent, and we believe that it will continue to depend, on our customer relationship with Tesla, which accounted for 55 of our consolidated revenue for the six months ended September 30, 2024, and 51 of our consolidated revenue for the six months ended September 30, 2023. Our existing agreement with Tesla governs our music services to certain of its car user base in North America, including our audio music streaming services. As of October 2024, Tesla has extended the term of our license agreement (the license agreement until at least May 2026, and the license agreement is expected to continue to be renewed thereafter on its terms. Tesla has agreed to pay us for any grandfathered users for the term of the license agreement, however Tesla will no longer pay us for any other users beginning in December 2024. If we fail to maintain certain minimum service level requirements related to our service with Tesla or other obligations related to our technology or services, Tesla may terminate the license agreement to provide them with such service. Tesla may also terminate our license agreement for convenience at any time with prior notice to us. If Tesla terminates our license agreement, further modifies the services that we provide to Tesla under such agreement, requires us to renegotiate the terms of such agreement or we are unable to renew such agreement on mutually agreeable terms, no longer pays for and/or makes our music services available to Tesla s paid grandfathered car user base, no longer makes an option for its car users to sign up for LiveOne, becomes a native music service provider, replaces our music services with one or more of our competitors and/or we experience a significant further reduction of business from Tesla, our business, financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected. 
 
 In addition, membership revenue we generate from Tesla from grandfathered car users is indirectly subsidized by Tesla to its customers, which Tesla plans to carry indefinitely but is not obligated to do so, including the ability to make available, terminate and/or change our music services for convenience at any time with prior notice to us. Should our membership revenue services no longer be subsidized by and/or made available by Tesla to its grandfathered customers or if Tesla reclassifies or renegotiates with us the definition of a paid grandfathered member or demands credit for past members that no longer meet such requirement, there can be no assurance that we will continue to maintain the same number of paid grandfathered members or receive the same levels of membership service revenue from such members. There is no assurance that we would be able to replace Tesla or lost business with Tesla with one or more customers that generate comparable revenue. Furthermore, there could be no assurance that Tesla will continue indefinitely to pay us for grandfathered car users. 
 
 Tesla has also integrated Spotify Premium to the car s in-dash touchscreen for its Model S, Model X and Model 3 vehicles. Tesla owners now have access to our music streaming services, Spotify and TuneIn natively. There is no assurance that our music streaming services will be available in every current and/or future Tesla model. Furthermore, our current and future competitors like Spotify, Apple Music, Tesla (if it becomes a native music service provider) and others may have more well-established brand recognition, more established relationships with, and superior access to content providers and other industry stakeholders, greater financial, technical and other resources, more sophisticated technologies or more experience in the markets in which we compete. If we are unable to compete successfully for users against our competitors by maintaining and increasing our presence and visibility, the number of users of our network may fail to increase as expected or decline and our advertising sales, membership fees and other revenue streams will suffer. 
 
 We rely on our relationship with our largest OEM customer for a substantial percentage of our potential subscribers who are now eligible to convert to become direct customers of LiveOne. Our inability to convert a significant number of these subscribers could cause a significant reduction of our business and could significantly adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 Our business is dependent, and we believe that it will continue to depend, on our customer relationship with Tesla, our largest OEM customer. Commencing in October 2024, we began working with Tesla to convert Tesla s connectivity package users to become direct subscribers (members) of our Premium or Plus service. The direct subscription to LiveOne allows such users for the first time to access their LiveOne music and LiveOne s other service offerings directly across all of their devices. LiveOne s music streaming button/icon, which allows users to directly connect their subscription to LiveOne, is expected to remain in Tesla s music streaming services dashboard in perpetuity. As a result, we believe we now have a unique opportunity to convert as many of Tesla s drivers as possible to a higher priced LiveOne subscription service creating a meaningful upside opportunity for our Company, and we are working in good faith with Tesla to convert as many of these drivers as possible. 
 
 We believe that with the full cooperation from Tesla, we can convert a substantial number of such users to become direct subscribers of LiveOne. However, there is no assurance that we would be able to convert a substantial number of such users to become direct subscribers of LiveOne and/or replace Tesla or lost business with Tesla with one or more other B2B customers that generate comparable revenue. If we fail to convert a significant number of these drivers as direct subscribers of LiveOne that could cause a significant reduction of our business and could significantly adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, even such drivers elect to directly pay for their subscription to LiveOne services, there can be no assurance that we will continue to maintain the same number of paid subscribers or receive the same levels of subscription service revenue and subscription revenue may substantially fluctuate accordingly. Accordingly, there could be no assurance that our revenue and/or EBITDA continues to grow at the same rate of growth as in 2024 calendar year or at all. 
 
 We have incurred significant operating and net losses since our inception and anticipate that we will continue to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future. 
 
 As reflected in our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein, we have a history of losses, incurred significant operating and net losses in each year since our inception, including net losses of 3.9 million and 13.3 million for the six months ended September 30, 2024 and fiscal year ended March 31, 2024, respectively, and cash provided by operating activities of 7.1 million and 6.8 million for the six months ended September 30, 2024 and fiscal year ended March 31, 2024, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of 248.6 million and a working capital deficit of 22.3 million. 
 
 We expect to continue to incur substantial and increased expenses as we continue to execute our business approach, including expanding and developing our content and platform and potentially making other accretive acquisitions, and anticipate incurring additional losses until such time that we can generate significant increases to our revenues, and/or reduce our operating costs and losses. To date, we have financed our operations exclusively through the sale of equity and/or securities (including convertible securities), and after PodcastOne s acquisition by us on July 1, 2020, through our sale of PodcastOne s and our equity and/or debt securities (including convertible securities). The size of our future net losses will depend, in part, on the rate of future expenditures and our ability to significantly grow our business and increase our revenues. We expect to continue to incur substantial and increased expenses as we grow our business. We also expect a continued increase in our expenses associated with our operations as a publicly-traded company. We may incur significant losses in the future for a number of other reasons, including unsuccessful acquisitions, costs of integrating new businesses, expenses, difficulties, complications, delays and other unknown events. As a result of the foregoing, we expect to continue to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future and we may not be able to achieve or sustain profitability.

The likelihood of our success must be considered in light of the problems, expenses, difficulties, complications and delays frequently encountered by a growing company, the difficulties that may be encountered with integrating acquired companies and the highly competitive environment in which we operate. For example, while several companies have been successful in the digital music streaming industry and the online video streaming industry, companies have had no or limited success in operating a premium Internet network devoted to live music and music-related video content. We cannot assure you that our business will be profitable or that we will ever generate sufficient revenue to fully meet our expenses and support our anticipated activities. 
 
 Our ability to meet our total liabilities of 61.4 million as of September 30, 2024, and to continue as a going concern, is dependent on our ability to increase revenue, reduce costs, achieve a satisfactory level of profitable operations, obtain additional sources of suitable and adequate financing and further develop and execute on our business plan. We may never achieve profitability, and even if we do, we may not be able to sustain being profitable. As a result of the going concern uncertainty, there is an increased risk that you could lose the entire amount of your investment in our company, which assumes the realization of our assets and the satisfaction of our liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. 
 
 We may be subject to risks associated with artificial intelligence and machine learning technology 
 
 Recent technological advances in AI and machine learning technology may pose risks to us. Our use of AI could give rise to legal or regulatory action, create liabilities, or materially harm our business. While we aim to develop and use AI and machine learning technology responsibly and attempt to mitigate ethical and legal issues presented by its use, we may ultimately be unsuccessful in identifying or resolving issues before they arise. Further, as the technology is rapidly evolving, costs and obligations could be imposed on us to comply with new regulations. 
 
 We also could be exposed to the risks of machine learning technology if third-party service providers or any counterparties, whether or not known to us, also use machine learning technology in their business activities. We will not be in a position to control the use of such technology in third-party products or services. Use by third-party service providers could give rise to issues pertaining to data privacy, data protection, and intellectual property considerations. 
 
 Increased data protection regulation may result in increased complexities and risk in connection with the operation of our business and our products. 
 
 Our business is highly dependent on information systems and technology. The costs related to cyber or other security threats or disruptions may not be fully insured or indemnified by other means. Cybersecurity has become a priority for regulators in the U.S. and around the world. Recently, the SEC adopted rules requiring public companies to disclose material cybersecurity incidents on Form 8-K and periodic disclosure of a registrant s cybersecurity risk management, strategy, and governance in annual reports. The rules became effective beginning with annual reports for fiscal years ending on or after December 15, 2023, and beginning with Form 8-Ks on December 18, 2023. The SEC has also particularly focused on cybersecurity, and we expect increased scrutiny of our policies and systems designed to manage our cybersecurity risks and our related disclosures as a result. We also expect to face increased costs to comply with the new SEC rules, including increased costs for cybersecurity training and management. The SEC has indicated in recent periods that one of its examination priorities for the Division of Examinations is to continue to examine cybersecurity procedures and controls, including testing the implementation of these procedures and controls. 
 
 There may be substantial financial penalties or fines for breach of privacy laws (which may include insufficient security for our personal or other sensitive information). Non-compliance with any applicable privacy or data security laws represents a serious risk to our business. Some jurisdictions have also enacted laws requiring companies to notify individuals of data security breaches involving certain types of personal information. Breaches in security could potentially jeopardize our or our stockholders or counterparties confidential or other information processed and stored in, or transmitted through, our computer systems and networks (or those of our third-party vendors), or otherwise cause interruptions or malfunctions in our or our stockholders or our counterparties or third parties operations, which could result in significant losses, increased costs, disruption of our business, liability to our stockholders and other counterparties, fines or penalties, litigation, regulatory intervention or reputational damage, which could also lead to loss of stockholders. 
 
 Finally, there has been significant evolution and developments in the use of AI technologies. We cannot fully determine the impact or cybersecurity risk of such evolving technology to our business at this time. 
 
 If we do not respond to technological innovations or changes or upgrade our technology systems, our growth prospects and results of operations could be adversely affected. 
 
 To remain competitive, we must continue to enhance and improve the functionality, features and security of our technology infrastructure. Infrastructure upgrades may require significant capital investment outside of the normal course of business. In the future, we will likely need to improve and upgrade our technology, database systems and network infrastructure to allow our business to grow in both size and scope. Without such improvements, our operations might suffer from unanticipated system disruptions, slow performance or unreliable service levels, any of which could negatively affect our ability to provide rapid customer service. We may face significant delays in introducing new services or developing new technologies. Moreover, if we do not keep pace with the rapid innovations and changes taking place in information technology in our industry, we could be at a competitive disadvantage. Further, the rapid dissemination and increasing transparency of information, particularly for public companies, increases the risks to our business that could result from negative media or announcements about ethics lapses, improper behavior or other operational problems, which could lead clients to terminate or reduce their relationships with us. If competitors introduce new products and services using new technologies, our proprietary technology and systems may become less competitive, and our business may be harmed. In addition, the expansion and improvement of our systems and infrastructure may require us to commit substantial financial, operational and technical resources, with no assurance that our business will improve.

Risks Related to Our Company 
 
 We may not have the ability to repay the amounts then due under our senior ABL Credit Facility at maturity. 
 
 At maturity, the entire outstanding principal amount of our ABL Credit Facility and the Capchase Loan, will become due and payable by us. As of September 30, 2024, 0.2 million is due in fiscal 2025, 0.6 million due in fiscal 2026, 0.1 million of our total indebtedness is due in fiscal 2027 and 0.1 million thereafter. 
 
 Our failure to repay any outstanding amount under our ABL Credit Facility would constitute a default under such facility. A default would increase the interest rate to the default rate under the ABL Credit Facility or the maximum rate permitted by applicable law until such amount is paid in full. A default under the ABL Credit Facility could also lead to a default under agreements governing our future indebtedness, including the Capchase Loan. If the repayment of the related indebtedness were to be accelerated after any applicable notice or grace periods, we may not have sufficient funds to repay our ABL Credit Facility or make cash payments thereon. Furthermore, upon the occurrence and during the continuation of any event of default, the senior lender shall have the right to, among other things, take possession of our and our subsidiaries assets and property constituting the collateral thereunder and the right to assign, sell, lease or otherwise dispose of all or any part of the collateral. 
 
 If we do not comply with the provisions of the ABL Credit Facility, the Capchase Loan and/or the SX Settlement, such parties may terminate their obligations to us, accelerate our debt and/or require us to repay all outstanding amounts owed thereunder. 
 
 The ABL Credit Facility and the Capchase Loan contain provisions that limit our operating activities, including covenant relating to the requirement to maintain a certain amount cash (as provided in the senior credit facility loan agreement). If an event of default occurs and is continuing, the applicable lender may among other things, terminate its obligations thereunder, accelerate its debt and require us to repay all amounts thereunder. For example, on October 13, 2022, a judgement was ordered in favor of SoundExchange, Inc. SX against us and Slacker in the United States District Court Central District of California in the amount of approximately 9.8 million. On October 13, 2022, the court entered a judgment against the defendants for the amount of 9,765,396.70. In February 2023, we settled the dispute (the SX Settlement Agreement to pay the outstanding amount in equal monthly payments subject to increase in the event we complete certain future financings. As of September 30, 2024, we owed 4.9 million to SX under the SX Settlement Agreement. In addition, the SX Settlement Agreement requires us and Slacker to pay SX a final payment of 2,189,775.08 on or before February 1, 2025, unless the parties agree to further extend the timing of such payment. If for any reason we and Slacker fail to comply with the terms of the SX settlement agreement, the final payment will increase by 925,391.40, and SX will have the right to declare a default under the SX Settlement Agreement and at its option require us to repay all outstanding amounts owed thereunder and/or enforce its consent judgment and/or pursue a new judgment against us and Slacker, which would materially adversely impact our business, operating results and financial condition. Our debt agreements with the ABL Credit Facility and Capchase Loan lenders contain a covenant that if a material adverse change occurs in our financial condition, or if such senior secured lender reasonably believes the prospect of payment or performance of their loan is materially impaired, the lender at its option may immediately accelerate its debt and require us to repay all outstanding amounts owed thereunder. If for any reason we and Slacker fail to comply with the terms of the SX Settlement Agreement, our senior credit facility provider, and which would then also allow Capchase to declare a default under their loan agreement with us, may declare an event of default and at its option may immediately accelerate its debt and require us to repay all outstanding amounts owed under the senior credit facility provider, which would materially adversely impact our business, operating results and financial condition. As of September 30, 2024 we were in compliance with covenants under the ABL Credit Facility and the Loan. 
 
 Our debt agreements contain restrictive and financial covenants that may limit our operating flexibility, and our substantial indebtedness may limit cash flow available to invest in the ongoing needs of our business. 
 
 We have a significant amount of indebtedness. Our total outstanding consolidated indebtedness as of September 30, 2024 was 8.1 million, net of fees and discounts. While we have certain restrictions and covenants with our current indebtedness, we could in the future incur additional indebtedness beyond such amount. Our existing debt agreements with ABL Credit Facility lender and the Capchase Loan lenders contain certain restrictive covenants that limit our ability to merge with other companies or consummate certain changes of control, make certain investments, pay dividends or repurchase shares of our common stock, transfer or dispose of assets, or enter into various specified transactions. We therefore may not be able to engage in any of the foregoing transactions unless we obtain the consent of our senior secured lenders, terminate our existing debt agreements and/or repay the amount owed to such lenders. Our debt agreements also contain certain covenants, including maintaining a minimum cash amount at all times and are secured by substantially all of our assets. There is no guarantee that we will be able to generate sufficient cash flow or sales to pay the principal and interest owed under our debt agreements or to satisfy all of the covenants. We and/or our subsidiaries may also incur significant additional indebtedness in the future. 

25

Table of Contents 

Our substantial debt combined with our other financial obligations and contractual commitments could have other significant adverse consequences, including: 

requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of cash flow from operations to the payment of interest on, and principal of, our debt, which will reduce the amounts available to fund working capital, capital expenditures, product development efforts and other general corporate purposes; 

increasing our vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic, industry and market conditions; 

obligating us to restrictive covenants that may reduce our ability to take certain corporate actions or obtain further debt or equity financing; 

limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we compete; and 

placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt or better debt servicing options. 

We intend to satisfy our current and future debt service obligations with our existing cash and cash equivalents and funds from external sources, including equity and/or debt financing. However, we may not have sufficient funds or may be unable to arrange for additional financing to pay the amounts due under our existing debt. Funds from external sources may not be available on acceptable terms, if at all. In the event of an acceleration of amounts due under our debt instruments as a result of an event of default, including upon the occurrence of an event that would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on our business, operations, properties, assets or condition or a failure to pay any amount due, we may not have sufficient funds or may be unable to arrange for additional financing to repay our indebtedness or to make any accelerated payments. 
 
 We depend upon third-party licenses for sound recordings and musical compositions and other content and an adverse change to, loss of, or claim that we do not hold any necessary licenses may materially adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. 
 
 To secure the rights to stream sound recordings and the musical compositions embodied therein, we enter into license agreements to obtain licenses from rights holders such as record labels, aggregators, artists, music publishers, performing rights organizations, collecting societies and other copyright owners or their agents, and pay substantial royalties or other consideration to such parties or their agents around the world. Though we work diligently in our efforts to obtain all necessary licenses to stream sound recordings and the musical compositions embodied therein, there is no guarantee that the licenses available to us now will continue to be available in the future at rates and on terms that are favorable or commercially reasonable or at all. The terms of these licenses, including the royalty rates that we are required to pay pursuant to them, may change as a result of changes in our bargaining power, changes in the industry, changes in the laws and regulations, or for other reasons. Increases in royalty rates or changes to other terms of these licenses may materially impact our business, operating results, and financial condition. 
 
 We enter into license agreements to obtain rights to stream sound recordings, including from the major record labels that hold the rights to stream a significant number of sound recordings, such as Universal Music Group, Sony Music Entertainment, Warner Music Group and SX, as well as others. If we fail to obtain these licenses or if any of such licenses are terminated or suspended, the size and quality of our catalog may be materially impacted and our business, operating results and financial condition could be materially harmed. 

26

Table of Contents 

We generally obtain licenses for two types of rights with respect to musical compositions: mechanical rights and public performance rights. With respect to mechanical rights, for example, in the United States, the rates we pay are, to a significant degree, a function of a ratemaking proceeding conducted by an administrative agency called the Copyright Royalty Board. The rates that the Copyright Royalty Board set apply both to compositions that we license under the compulsory license in Section 115 of the Copyright Act of 1976 (the Copyright Act ), and to a number of direct licenses that we have with music publishers for U.S. rights, in which the applicable rate is generally pegged to the statutory rate set by the Copyright Royalty Board. The most recent proceeding before the Copyright Royalty Board (the Phonorecords III Proceedings set the rates for the Section 115 compulsory license for calendar years 2018 to 2022. The Copyright Royalty Board issued its initial written determination on January 26, 2018. The rates set by the Copyright Royalty Board may still be modified if a party appeals the determination and are also subject to further change as part of future Copyright Royalty Board proceedings. If any such rate change increases, our sound recordings and musical compositions license costs may substantially increase and impact our ability to obtain content on pricing terms favorable to us, and it could negatively harm our business, operating results and financial condition and hinder our ability to provide interactive features in our services or cause one or more of our services not to be economically viable. Based on management s estimates and forecasts for the next two fiscal years, we currently believe that the proposed rates will not materially impact our business, operating results, and financial condition. However, the proposed rates are based on a variety of factors and inputs which are difficult to predict in the long-term. If Slacker s business does not perform as expected or if the rates are modified to be higher than the proposed rates, its content acquisition costs could increase and impact its ability to obtain content on pricing terms favorable to us, which could negatively harm Slacker s business, operating results and financial condition and hinder its ability to provide interactive features in its services, or cause one or more of Slacker s services not to be economically viable. 
 
 In the United States, public performance rights are generally obtained through intermediaries known as performing rights organizations PROs ), which negotiate blanket licenses with copyright users for the public performance of compositions in their repertory, collect royalties under such licenses, and distribute those royalties to copyright owners. The royalty rates available to Slacker today may not be available to it in the future. Licenses provided by two of these PROs, the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers ASCAP and Broadcast Music, Inc. BMI ), cover the majority of the music we stream and are governed by consent decrees relating to decades old litigations. In 2019, the U.S. Department of Justice indicated that it was formally reviewing the relevance and need of these consent decrees. Changes to the terms of or interpretation of these consent decrees up to and including the dissolution of the consent decrees, could affect our ability to obtain licenses from these PROs on reasonable terms, which could harm its business, operating results, and financial condition. In addition, an increase in the number of compositions that must be licensed from PROs that are not subject to the consent decrees, or from copyright owners that have withdrawn public performance rights from the PROs, could likewise impede Slacker s ability to license public performance rights on favorable terms. As of September 30, 2024, we owed 19.7 million in aggregate royalty payments to such PROs. 
 
 In other parts of the world, including Europe, Asia, and Latin America, we obtain mechanical and performance licenses for musical compositions either through local collecting societies representing publishers or from publishers directly, or a combination thereof. We cannot guarantee that its licenses with collecting societies and its direct licenses with publishers provide full coverage for all of the musical compositions we make available to our users in such countries. In Asia and Latin America, we are seeing a trend of movement away from blanket licenses from copyright collectives, which is leading to a fragmented copyright licensing landscape. Publishers, songwriters, and other rights holders choosing not to be represented by collecting societies could adversely impact our ability to secure favorable licensing arrangements in connection with musical compositions that such rights holders own or control, including increasing the costs of licensing such musical compositions, or subjecting us to significant liability for copyright infringement. 
 
 With respect to podcasts and other non-music content, we produce or commission the content itself or obtain distribution rights directly from rights holders. In the former scenario, we employ various business models to create original content. In the latter scenario, we and/or PodcastOne negotiates licenses directly with individuals that enable creators to post content directly to our service after agreeing to comply with the applicable terms and conditions. We are dependent on those who provide content on our service complying with the terms and conditions of our license agreements as well as the PodcastOne Terms and Conditions of Use. However, we cannot guarantee that rights holders or content providers will comply with their obligations, and such failure to do so may materially impact our business, operating results, and financial condition. 

27

Table of Contents 

There also is no guarantee that we have all of the licenses we need to stream content, as the process of obtaining such licenses involves many rights holders, some of whom are unknown, and myriad complex legal issues across many jurisdictions, including open questions of law as to when and whether particular licenses are needed. Additionally, there is a risk that rights holders, creators, performers, writers and their agents, or societies, unions, guilds, or legislative or regulatory bodies will create or attempt to create new rights that could require us to enter into license agreements with, and pay royalties to, newly defined groups of rights holders, some of which may be difficult or impossible to identify. 
 
 Even when we can enter into license agreements with rights holders, we cannot guarantee that such agreements will continue to be renewed indefinitely. For example, from time to time, our license agreements with certain rights holders and/or their agents may expire while we negotiate their renewals and, per industry custom and practice, we may enter into brief (for example, month-, week-, or even days-long) extensions of those agreements or provisional licenses and/or continue to operate on an at will basis as if the license agreement had been extended, including by our continuing to make music available. During these periods, we may not have assurance of long-term access to such rights holders content, which could have a material adverse effect on its business and could lead to potential copyright infringement claims. Furthermore, if we fail to timely make any royalty or license payments to such rights holders, they may elect to terminate or suspend our license agreements with them. 
 
 It also is possible that such agreements will never be renewed at all. The lack of renewal, or suspension or termination, of one or more of our license agreements, or the renewal of a license agreement on less favorable terms, also could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, and results of operations. 
 
 For the years ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, our management concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting were not effective due to the existence of material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting during such periods. If we are unable to establish and maintain effective disclosure controls and internal controls over financial reporting, our ability to produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis or prevent fraud could be impaired, and the market price of our securities may be negatively affected. 
 
 Effective internal controls over financial reporting are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and, together with adequate disclosure controls and procedures, are designed to prevent fraud. Any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or difficulties encountered in their implementation could cause us to fail to meet PodcastOne s reporting obligations. In addition, any testing by our Company conducted in connection with Section 404, or the subsequent testing by our independent registered public accounting firm, if and when required, may reveal additional deficiencies in its internal controls over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses or that may require prospective or retroactive changes to our consolidated financial statements or identify other areas for further attention or improvement. For our fiscal years ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, our management conducted an assessment of its disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting and concluded that they were ineffective for each of such periods, due to the existence of certain material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected and corrected on a timely basis. 
 
 In connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2024, our management identified a material weaknesses as follows: our management s identification of and accounting for significant and unusual transactions, specifically accounting for debt. This material weakness was remediated during the six months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 In connection with preparation of our consolidated financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2023, our management identified material weaknesses in the following: our controls related to the preparation of the financial statements were not adequately designed to ensure the accuracy and completeness of amounts and disclosures and the classification between current and noncurrent liabilities; and our management s identification of and accounting for significant and unusual transactions, specifically accounting for business combinations, including push down accounting. This material weakness was remediated during the year ended March 31, 2024. 
 
 If we are unable to establish and maintain proper and effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, it may not be able to produce timely and accurate financial statements. 
 
 Risks Related to the Ownership of Our Common Stock 
 
 Conversion of our Series A Preferred Stock will dilute the ownership interest of our existing stockholders, including holders who had previously converted their convertible notes, or may otherwise depress the price of our common stock. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, the shares of our Series A Preferred Stock are convertible into approximately 6.28 million shares of our common stock at a price of 2.10 per share of common stock. The conversion of some or all of the shares of our Series A Preferred Stock into shares of our common stock will dilute the ownership interests of our existing stockholders. In addition, any sales in the public market of the shares of our common stock issuable upon such conversion and/or any anticipated conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock into shares of our common stock could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock.

Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds. 
 
 Issuance of Unregistered Securities 
 
 Other than as set forth below and as reported in our Current Reports on Form 8-K, there have been no other sales or issuances of unregistered securities during the period covered by this Quarterly Report that were not registered under the Securities Act. 
 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we issued 59,270 shares of our common stock valued at 0.2 million to various consultants. We valued these shares at prices between 1.75 and 1.86 per share, the market price of our common stock on the date of issuance. 
 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2023, we issued 425,988 shares of our common stock valued at 0.6 million to various consultants. We valued these shares at prices between 0.89 and 1.29 per share, the market price of our common stock on the date of issuance. 
 
 We believe the offers, sales and issuances of the securities described above were made in reliance on the exemption from registration contained in Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act and/or Rule 506 of Regulation D promulgated thereunder and involved a transaction by an issuer not involving any public offering. Each of the recipients of securities in any transaction exempt from registration either received or had adequate access, through employment, business or other relationships, to information about us.
