 MERIT MEDICAL SYSTEMS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited) Disaggregation of Revenue Our revenue is disaggregated based on reporting segment, product category and geographic region. We design, develop, manufacture and market medical products for interventional, diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. For financial reporting purposes, we report our operations in operating segments: cardiovascular and endoscopy. Our cardiovascular segment consists of product categories: peripheral intervention, cardiac intervention, custom procedural solutions, and original equipment manufacturer OEM ). Within these product categories, we sell a variety of products, including cardiology and radiology devices (which assist in diagnosing and treating coronary arterial disease, peripheral vascular disease and other non-vascular diseases), as well as embolotherapeutic, cardiac rhythm management, electrophysiology, critical care, breast cancer localization and guidance, biopsy, and interventional oncology and spine devices. Our endoscopy segment consists of gastroenterology and pulmonology devices which assist in the palliative treatment of expanding esophageal, tracheobronchial and biliary strictures.

It is not practical to separately report earnings related to the EGS Acquisition, as we began to immediately integrate the acquisition into the existing operations, sales distribution networks and management structure of our endoscopy business segment. Acquisition-related costs associated with the EGS Acquisition, which were included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of income were approximately million.

On May 17, 2024, Merit Medical Ireland Limited MM Ireland ), our indirect wholly-owned subsidiary, entered into a Subscription and Shareholder Agreement (the CrannMed Agreement with CrannMed Limited, a company organized under the laws of Ireland CrannMed ). Pursuant to the terms of the CrannMed Agreement, MM Ireland paid million to purchase preferred shares of CrannMed. At CrannMed s election at any time after August 16, 2024, MM Ireland is obligated to pay an additional million to acquire additional preferred shares of CrannMed, subject to certain conditions (the Second Tranche Investment no additional amount has been distributed to CrannMed as of September 30, 2024. Additionally, upon the request of CrannMed and subject to the completion of the Second Tranche Investment and other conditions, MM Ireland may pay to CrannMed up to an additional million in the form of equity, debt or other investment for the purpose of funding clinical trial activities of CrannMed. MM Ireland s investment in CrannMed has been recorded as an equity investment accounted for at cost and reflected within other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets because MM Ireland is not able to exercise significant influence over the operations of CrannMed.

Aggregate amortization expense for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2023 was million and million, respectively. We evaluate long-lived assets, including amortizing intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. We perform the impairment analysis at the asset group for which the lowest level of identifiable cash flows is largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. If a triggering event is identified, we determine the fair value of our amortizing assets based on estimated future cash flows discounted back to their present value using a discount rate that reflects the risk profiles of the underlying activities.

Our provision for income taxes for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was a tax expense of million and million, respectively, which resulted in an effective tax rate of and , respectively. The increase in the effective income tax rate for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, when compared to the respective prior-year periods, was primarily due to decreased benefit from discrete items such as share-based compensation and decreased foreign tax credit utilization. The increase in the income tax expense for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, when compared to the prior-year period, was primarily due to increased pre-tax book income. Our effective tax rate differs from the U.S. statutory rate primarily due to the impact of global intangible low-taxed income GILTI inclusions, state income taxes, foreign taxes, other nondeductible permanent items and discrete items (such as share-based compensation).

The Fourth A R Credit Agreement is a syndicated loan agreement with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association and other parties. The Fourth A R Credit Agreement amended and restated in its entirety our previously outstanding Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement and all amendments thereto. The Fourth A R Credit Agreement provides for a term loan of million and a revolving credit commitment of up to an aggregate amount of million, inclusive of sub-facilities for multicurrency borrowings, standby letters of credit and swingline loans. On June 6, 2028, all principal, interest and other amounts outstanding under the Fourth Amended Credit Agreement are payable in full. At any time prior to the maturity date, we may repay any amounts owing under all term loans and revolving credit loans in whole or in part, without premium or penalty. On December 5, 2023, we executed an amendment to the Fourth Amended Credit Agreement (as amended, the "Amended Fourth A R Credit Agreement") to facilitate the issuance of our Convertible Notes described below. Among other things, the amendment also updated the definition of the Applicable Margin as used in the Amended Fourth A R Credit Agreement to determine the interest rates and amended the financial covenants, all as described below.

(3) Minimum ratio of Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the Amended Fourth A R Credit Agreement and adjusted for certain expenditures) to Consolidated Interest Expense (as defined in the Amended Fourth A R Credit Agreement) for any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters. We were in compliance with these financial covenants set forth in the Amended Fourth A R Credit Agreement as of September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, we had outstanding borrowings of million and issued letter of credit guarantees of million under the Amended Fourth A R Credit Agreement, with additional available borrowings of approximately million, based on the maximum net leverage ratio and the aggregate revolving credit commitment pursuant to the Amended Fourth A R Credit Agreement. Our interest rate as of September 30, 2024 was a variable rate of with respect to the outstanding principal amount. Our interest rate as of December 31, 2023 was a fixed rate of on million as a result of an interest rate swap and a variable floating rate of on million. The foregoing interest rates do not reflect potential future changes in the Applicable Margin. Convertible Notes In December 2023, we issued convertible notes which bear interest at per year, payable semi-annually in arrears on February 1 and August 1 of each year, beginning on August 1, 2024 (the Convertible Notes ). The Convertible Notes are senior unsecured obligations (as defined in the indenture governing the Convertible Notes (the Indenture )) of Merit and will mature on February 1, 2029, unless repurchased, redeemed or converted in accordance with their terms prior to such date. The net proceeds from the sale of the Convertible Notes were approximately million after deducting offering and issuance costs and before the costs of the Capped Call Transactions, as described below.

 shares of our common stock (the Common Stock per principal amount of notes, which equates to an initial conversion price of approximately per share of Common Stock, subject to adjustments as provided in the Indenture upon the occurrence of certain specified events. In addition, holders of the Convertible Notes Holders will have the right to require Merit to repurchase all or a part of their notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change (as defined in the Indenture) in cash at a fundamental change repurchase price of of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest up to, but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date. Conversion can occur at the option of the Holders at any time on or after October 1, 2028. Prior to October 1, 2028, Holders may only elect to convert the Convertible Notes under the following circumstances: (1) During the five business day period after any ten consecutive trading day period in which, for each day of that period, the trading price per principal amount of the Convertible Notes for such trading day was less than of the product of the last reported sale price of the Common Stock and the applicable conversion rate on such trading day; (2) Merit issues to common stockholders any rights, options, or warrants, entitling them, for a period of not more than , to purchase shares of Common Stock at a price per share less than the average closing sale price of 10 consecutive trading days, or Merit s election to make a distribution to common stockholders exceeding of the previous day s closing sale price; (3) Upon the occurrence of a Fundamental Change, as set forth in the Indenture; (4) During any calendar quarter (and only during such calendar quarter) beginning after March 31, 2024, if, the last reported sale price per share of the Common Stock exceeds of the applicable conversion price on each applicable trading day for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) in the period of the 30 consecutive trading day period ending on, and including, the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter; or (5) Prior to the related redemption date if Merit calls any Convertible Notes for redemption. As of September 30, 2024, none of the conditions permitting the Holders to convert their Convertible Notes early had been met. Therefore, the Convertible Notes are classified as long-term debt obligations. On or after February 7, 2027, we may redeem for cash all or part of the Convertible Notes, at our option, if the last reported sales price of Common Stock has been at least of the conversion price then in effect for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive), including the trading day immediately preceding the date on which we provide notice of redemption, during any 30 consecutive trading days ending on, and including, the trading day immediately before the date we send the related notice of the redemption. Upon conversion, Merit will (1) pay cash up to the aggregate principal amount of the Convertible Notes to be converted and (2) pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, shares of Common Stock, or a combination of cash and shares of Common Stock, at Merit s election, in respect of the remainder, if any, of its conversion obligation in excess of the aggregate principal amount of the Convertible Notes being converted. Capped Call Transactions In December 2023, in connection with the pricing of the Convertible Notes, Merit entered into privately negotiated capped call transactions Capped Call Transactions with certain of the initial purchasers and/or their respective affiliates and certain other financial institutions. The Capped Call Transactions cover, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments, the number of shares of Common Stock initially underlying the Convertible Notes and are generally expected to reduce potential dilution to the Common Stock upon any conversion of Convertible Notes and/or offset any cash payments Merit is required to make in excess of the principal amount of converted Convertible Notes, as the case may be, with such reduction and/or offset subject to a cap, based on a cap price initially equal to approximately per share of Common Stock, subject to certain adjustments under the terms of the Capped Call Transactions. The cost of the Capped Call Transactions was approximately million. The Capped Call Transactions do not meet the criteria for separate accounting as a derivative as they are indexed to the Common Stock. The premiums paid for the Capped Call Transactions have been included as a net reduction to Common Stock within stockholders' equity.

 million with Wells Fargo. In June 2023, certain terms under the swap agreement were amended to reflect the transition from LIBOR to SOFR, an alternative reference rate. Under the interest rate swap agreement, we fixed the one-month SOFR rate on that portion of our borrowings under the Amended Fourth A R Credit Agreement at for the period from June 1, 2023 to July 31, 2024. The variable portion of the interest rate swap is tied to the one-month SOFR rate (the benchmark interest rate). On a monthly basis, the interest rates under both the interest rate swap and the underlying debt reset, the swap is settled with the counterparty, and interest is paid. As of September 30, 2024, the term of our interest rate swap has expired. On December 31, 2023, our interest rate swap qualified as a cash flow hedge. The fair value of our interest rate swap as of December 31, 2023 was an asset of million, partially offset by million in deferred taxes. Foreign Currency Risk. We operate on a global basis and are exposed to the risk that our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows could be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. To reduce the potential effects of foreign currency exchange rate movements on net earnings, we enter into derivative financial instruments in the form of foreign currency exchange forward contracts with major financial institutions. Our policy is to enter into foreign currency derivative contracts with maturities of up to . We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk with respect to transactions and balances denominated in various currencies, with our most significant exposure related to transactions and balances denominated in Chinese Renminbi and Euros, among others. We do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. We do not believe we are subject to any credit risk contingent features related to our derivative contracts, and we seek to manage counterparty risk by allocating derivative contracts among several major financial institutions.

Convertible Notes For our Convertible Notes, the dilutive effect is calculated using the if-converted method. Upon surrender of the Convertible Notes for conversion, Merit will pay cash up to the aggregate principal amount of the Notes to be converted and pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, shares of Common Stock or a combination of cash and shares of Common Stock, at Merit s election, in respect of the remainder, if any, of Merit s conversion obligation in excess of the aggregate principal amount of the Convertible Notes being converted. Under the if-converted method, we include the number of shares required to satisfy the remaining conversion obligation, assuming all the Convertible Notes were converted. The convertible notes only have an impact on diluted earnings per share when the average share price of our common stock exceeds the conversion price of .

 shares of our Common Stock. We did t grant any stock options during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024. We use the Black-Scholes methodology to value the stock-based compensation expense for options. In applying the Black-Scholes methodology to the option grants, the fair value of our stock-based awards granted was estimated using the following assumptions for the periods indicated below: - Expected option term years Expected dividend yield Expected price volatility - The average risk-free interest rate is determined using the U.S. Treasury rate in effect as of the date of grant, based on the expected term of the stock award. We determine the expected term of stock options using the historical exercise behavior of employees. The expected price volatility was determined using a weighted average of daily historical volatility of our stock price over the corresponding expected option term and implied volatility based on recent trends of the daily historical volatility. For awards with a vesting period, compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the service period, which corresponds to the vesting period. As of September 30, 2024, the total remaining unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested stock options was million, which was expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years. Stock-Settled Performance-Based Restricted Stock Units Performance Stock Units During the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we granted performance stock units which represented up to and shares of Common Stock, respectively. Conversion of the performance stock units occurs at the end of the relevant performance periods, or after the agreement date, whichever is later. The number of shares delivered upon vesting at the end of the performance periods are based upon performance against specified financial performance metrics and relative total shareholder return as compared to the Russell 2000 Index rTSR ), as defined in the award agreements. We use Monte-Carlo simulations to estimate the grant-date fair value of the performance stock units linked to total shareholder return. The fair value of each performance stock unit was estimated as of the grant date using the following assumptions for awards granted in the periods indicated below: - Performance period years years Expected dividend yield Expected price volatility - The risk-free interest rate of return was determined using the U.S. Treasury rate at the time of grant with a term equal to the expected term of the award. The expected volatility was based on the weighted average volatility of our stock price and the average volatility of our compensation peer group's stock price. The expected dividend yield was assumed to be because, at the time of the grant, we had no plans to declare a dividend.

Cash-Settled Performance-Based Awards During the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we granted performance stock units to our Chief Executive Officer that provide for settlement in cash upon achievement of specific metrics Liability Awards ), with total target cash incentives in the amount of million and million, respectively. The Liability Awards entitle him to a target cash payment based upon our level of rTSR performance and achievement of other performance metrics, as defined in the award agreements. During the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we granted additional performance stock units to certain employees that provide for settlement in cash upon our achievement of specified financial metrics. The cash payable upon vesting at the end of the service period is based upon performance against specified financial performance metrics and relative total shareholder return as compared to the rTSR, as defined in the award agreements. Compensation expense is recognized for the cash payment likely to be awarded based on the performance metrics. The potential maximum payout of these Liability Awards is of the target cash incentive, resulting in a total potential maximum payout of million and million for Liability Awards granted during the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The settlement generally occurs at the end of three-year performance periods based upon the same performance metrics and vesting period as our performance stock units. The fair value of these Liability Awards is measured at each reporting period until the awards are settled. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the recorded balance associated with these Liability Awards is million and million, respectively, which are classified as liabilities and reported in accrued expenses and other long-term obligations within our consolidated balance sheets.

Restricted Stock Units During the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we granted restricted stock units to certain employees and non-employee directors representing and shares of Common Stock, respectively. The expense recognized for restricted stock units is equal to the closing stock price on the date of grant, which is recognized over the vesting period. Restricted stock units granted to each employee are subject to such employee s continued employment through the vesting date, which is from the date of grant. Restricted stock units granted to each non-employee director are subject to such director s continued service through the vesting date, which is from the grant date. As of September 30, 2024, the total remaining unrecognized compensation cost related to restricted stock units was million, which will be recognized over a weighted average period of years. operating segments: cardiovascular and endoscopy. Our cardiovascular segment consists of product categories: peripheral intervention, cardiac intervention, custom procedural solutions, and OEM.

 Certain of our past business combinations involve the potential for the payment of future contingent consideration, generally based on a percentage of future product sales or upon attaining specified future revenue or other milestones. The contingent consideration liability is re-measured at the estimated fair value at the end of each reporting period with the change in fair value recognized within operating expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of income for such period. We measure the initial liability and re-measure the liability on a recurring basis using Level 3 inputs as defined under authoritative guidance for fair value measurements.

Our gross profit as a percentage of sales increased to 47.0 for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, compared to 46.5 for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023. The increase in gross profit percentage was primarily due to an increase in sales combined with favorable changes in product mix, partially offset by unfavorable manufacturing variances and higher intangible amortization expense as a percentage of sales associated with acquisitions.

For the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, SG A expenses increased compared to the corresponding period of 2023, primarily due to an increase in labor related costs associated with headcount additions and employee termination benefits in connection with the integration activities for the EGS Acquisition, increased consulting and legal costs associated with acquisition due diligence, increased advertising and promotional expenses. SG A expenses increased 10.7 million, or 3.9 , for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 compared to the corresponding period of 2023.

For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, SG A expenses increased compared to the corresponding period of 2023 primarily due to an increase in labor-related costs in our sales and marketing operations due to increased headcount to support growth and acquisitions, an increase of variable compensation linked to company performance , an increase of stock-based compensation expense associated with new equity grants, and an increased investment in advertising and promotional expenses.

For the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, R D expenses increased compared to the corresponding period of 2023 primarily due to increased labor costs due to increased headcount and increased materials for projects, offset partially by decreased regulatory costs related to clinical studies. R D expenses for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 were 62.3 million, up 1.9 , when compared to R D expenses in the corresponding period of 2023 of 61.1 million.

F or the three-month period ended September 30, 2023, we recognized no impairment charges.

Contingent Consideration Expense . For the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, we recognized contingent consideration expense from changes in the estimated fair value of our contingent consideration obligations stemming from our previously disclosed business acquisitions of 0.1 million and 0.3 million, respectively, compared to contingent consideration expense of 0.6 million and 2.2 million for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2023, respectively.

 Operating Income The following table sets forth our operating income by financial reporting segment for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands): 

Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 30, September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Operating Income Cardiovascular 37,555 32,622 113,374 82,966 Endoscopy (294) 2,515 5,755 7,366 Total operating income 37,261 35,137 119,129 90,332 Cardiovascular Operating Income. Our cardiovascular operating income for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 was 37.6 million, compared to cardiovascular operating income in the corresponding period of 2023 of 32.6 million. The increase in cardiovascular operating income during the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 compared to the corresponding period of 2023 was primarily a result of higher sales 322.9 million compared to 306.1 million), higher gross margin, and lower contingent consideration expense, partially offset by higher SG A and R D expenses . Our cardiovascular operating income for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 was 113.4 million, compared to cardiovascular operating income in the corresponding period of 2023 of 83.0 million. The increase in cardiovascular operating income during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 compared to the corresponding period of 2023 was primarily a result of higher sales 964.0 million compared to 905.3 million), higher gross margin, lower acquired in-process research and development charges, lower impairment charges, and lower contingent consideration expense, partially offset by higher SG A and R D expenses . Endoscopy Operating Income (Loss) . Our endoscopy operating loss for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 was 0.3) million, compared to endoscopy operating income of 2.5 million for the corresponding period of 2023. Our endoscopy operating income for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 was 5.8 million, compared to endoscopy operating income of 7.4 million for the corresponding period of 2023. The decrease in endoscopy operating income for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 compared to the corresponding periods of 2023 was primarily a result of increased SG A expenses associated with higher labor related costs due to headcount additions and employee termination benefits in connection with the integration activities for the EGS Acquisition, partially offset by increased sales. Other Expense Net Our other expense for the three-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 0.6 million and 4.9 million, respectively. Our other expense for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 2.3 million and 9.7 million, respectively. The changes in other expense for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 compared to the corresponding periods of 2023 were primarily related to increased interest expense associated with the Convertible Note offering completed in December 2023, partially offset by an increase in interest income associated with higher cash and cash equivalents balances.

 Effective Tax Rate Our provision for income taxes for the three-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was a tax expense of 8.2 million and 4.4 million, respectively, which resulted in an effective tax rate of 22.4 and 14.5 , respectively. Our provision for income taxes for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was a tax expense of 24.4 million and 13.8 million, respectively, which resulted in an effective tax rate of 20.9 and 17.2 , respectively. The increase in the effective income tax rate for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, when compared to the prior-year period, was primarily due to decreased benefit from discrete items such as share-based compensation and decreased foreign tax credit utilization. The increase in the income tax expense for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, when compared to the prior-year period, was primarily due to increased pre-tax book income. Net Income Our net income for the three-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 28.4 million and 25.8 million, respectively. The increase in our net income for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 was primarily a result of higher sales, higher gross margin associated and lower contingent consideration expense, partially offset by higher SG A and R D expenses and higher income tax expense. Our net income for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 92.4 million and 66.8 million, respectively. The increase in our net income for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 was the result of several principal factors, including higher sales and gross margin, lower impairment charges, lower acquired in-process research and development charges , and lower contingent consideration expense, partially offset by higher SG A and R D expenses and higher income tax expense. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Capital Commitments, Contractual Obligations and Cash Flows As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, our current assets exceeded current liabilities by 877.2 million and 904.9 million, respectively, and we had cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash of 525.3 million and 589.1 million, respectively, of which 55.8 million and 48.7 million, respectively, were held by foreign subsidiaries. We currently believe f uture repatriation of cash and other property held by our foreign subsidiaries will generally not be subject to U.S. federal income tax . As a result, we are not permanently reinvested with respect to our historic unremitted foreign earnings. In addition, cash held by our subsidiary in China is subject to local laws and regulations that require government approval for the transfer of such funds to entities located outside of China. As of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, we had cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash of 23.1 million and 17.6 million, respectively, within our subsidiary in China. Cash flows provided by operating activities . We generated cash from operating activities of 152.1 million and 82.9 million during the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Significant factors affecting operating cash flows during these periods included: Net income was 92.4 million and 66.8 million for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Cash used for inventories was approximately 2.8 million and 34.4 million for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase in inventories during 2023 was principally associated with our strategy to proactively invest in our inventory balances to encourage high customer service levels, as well as to build bridge inventory for production line transfers and increases in safety stock due to vendor supply delays. Cash used for trade payables was 6.5 million and 20.3 million for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, due primarily to the timing of payments.

 Cash flows used in investing activities. We used cash in investing activities of 154.2 million and 167.0 million for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. We used cash for capital expenditures of property and equipment of 31.7 million and 27.2 million in the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Capital expenditures in each period were primarily related to investments in property and equipment to support development and production of our products. Historically, we have incurred significant expenses in connection with facility construction, production automation, product development and the introduction of new products. We anticipate that we will spend approximately 50 million in 2024 for property and equipment. Cash outflows for the issuance of notes receivable were 6.6 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 and were related to loans issued to Selio of 1.7 million, Solo Pace of 2.0 million and Fluidx of 3.0 million.

Cash outflows invested in acquisitions for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023 were 138.3 million and were primarily related to payments in our asset purchase agreements with AngioDynamics 100 million), Bluegrass 32.7 million) and ART 1.5 million), and our investment in Solo Pace 4.0 million). Cash flows (used in) provided by financing activities. Cash (used in) provided by financing activities for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was (62.4) million and 86.5 million, respectively. For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, we decreased our net borrowings under our Amended Fourth A R Credit Agreement by (76.1) million. During the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023 we increased our net borrowings by approximately 88.9 million to finance the acquisitions of AngioDynamics and Bluegrass. We had cash proceeds from the issuance of common stock of 15.4 million and 11.5 million for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, related to the exercise of non-qualified stock options. We completed payment of contingent consideration of (0.2) million and (3.5) million for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, principally related to sales milestone payments connected to our acquisitions of Brightwater Medical, Inc. in 2019 and Cianna Medical, Inc. in 2018. As of September 30, 2024, we had outstanding borrowings of 770.5 million and had issued letter of credit guarantees of 2.4 million, with additional available borrowings of approximately 697 million under the Amended Fourth A R Credit Agreement, based on the maximum net leverage ratio and the aggregate revolving credit commitment pursuant to the Amended Fourth A R Credit Agreement. Our interest rate as of September 30, 2024 was a fixed rate of 3.0 on our Convertible Notes and a variable rate of 6.70 with respect to the principal amount outstanding under the Amended Fourth A R Credit Agreement. Our interest rate as of December 31, 2023 was a fixed rate of 3.0 on our Convertible Notes, a fixed rate of 3.39 on 75 million as a result of an interest rate swap, and a variable floating rate of 7.21 on 24.1 million. We currently believe that our existing cash balances, anticipated future cash flows from operations and borrowings under our long-term debt agreements will be adequate to fund our current and currently planned future operations for the next twelve months and the foreseeable future. In the event we pursue and complete significant transactions or acquisitions in the future, additional funds may be required to meet our strategic needs, which may require us to raise additional funds in the debt or equity markets. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES Our financial results are affected by the selection and application of accounting policies and methods. In the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 there were no changes to the application of critical accounting policies previously disclosed in Part II, Item 7 of the 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate disclosure controls and procedures for our company. Consequently, our management, with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act as of September 30, 2024. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs. Based on that evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are designed at a reasonable assurance level and are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

 We may incur substantial costs when evaluating, negotiating and closing acquisitions, and our failure to integrate acquired businesses may adversely impact our business and financial results. We seek to supplement our internal growth through strategic acquisitions and transactions. We have completed a series of strategic acquisitions and transactions in recent years, some of which have been significant, such as the AngioDynamics Acquisition and the EGS Acquisition. We are in the process of completing the proposed Cook Acquisition. We continue to evaluate other potential acquisitions and transactions, certain of which may also be significant. We have incurred, and will likely continue to incur, significant expenses in connection with evaluating, negotiating and consummating various acquisition and other transactions. Our integration of acquired businesses requires considerable efforts, including corporate restructuring and the coordination of information technologies, research and development, sales and marketing, operations, regulatory, supply chain, manufacturing, quality systems and finance. These efforts result in additional expenses and involve significant management time. Some of the factors that could affect the success of our acquisitions include, among others, the effectiveness of our due diligence process, our ability to execute our business plan for the acquired companies, the strength of the acquired technology, results of clinical trials, regulatory approvals and reimbursement levels of the acquired products and related procedures, the continued performance of critical transition services, our ability to adequately fund acquired in-process research and development projects and retain key employees and our ability to achieve synergies with our acquired companies, such as increasing sales of our products, achieving cost savings and effectively combining technologies to develop new products. Foreign acquisitions involve unique risks, including those related to integration of operations across different geographies, cultures and languages, currency risks and risks associated with the economic, political, legal and regulatory environment in specific countries. In addition, we have and may in the future acquire less than full ownership interests in other businesses, which involve unique challenges for effective collaboration. Further, other parties that hold remaining ownership interests in such businesses may at any time have economic or business goals that are inconsistent with our goals or the goals of such businesses. Our failure to manage these challenges successfully and coordinate the growth of such businesses or other investments could have an adverse impact on our business and our future growth. In addition, we cannot be certain that the businesses we acquire or invest in will become profitable or remain so, and if our acquisitions or investments are not successful, we may record related asset impairment charges in the future or experience other negative consequences on our operating results. Additionally, past and future acquisitions and transactions may increase the risks of competition we face by, among other things, extending our operations into industry segments and product lines where we have few existing customers or qualified sales personnel and limited expertise. Further, as a result of certain acquisitions, we are selling capital equipment, in addition to our historical sales of disposable medical devices. The sale of capital equipment may create additional risks and potential liability, which may negatively affect our business, operations or financial condition. In addition, we may not realize competitive advantages, synergies or other benefits anticipated in connection with any such acquisition or other transaction. If we do not adequately identify and value targets for, or manage issues related to, acquisitions and other transactions, such transactions may not produce the anticipated benefits and have an adverse effect on our business, operations or financial condition. We have incurred expenses in connection with the disposition of businesses and assets which we acquired but determined that they did not produce the benefits contemplated at the time of acquisition. We may incur similar expenses in the future. ITEM 5. OTHER INFORMATION During the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024, none of our directors or officers informed us of the or of a or , as those terms are defined in Regulation S-K, Item 408.

Purchased Asset. Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain such consents
and deliver any required notices under all Nonassignable Assets, and Buyer shall, and shall
cause its Affiliates to, cooperate with Seller to obtain such consents promptly. To the
extent permitted by applicable Law, in the event any requisite consent cannot be or is not

sentence, the out-of-pocket reasonable costs actually incurred by Seller to collect such
amounts for the benefit of Buyer and any applicable early termination fees or penalties
payable by Seller in connection with the Nonassignable Assets, so long as Seller obtained
Buyer s written consent prior to incurring such costs to collect such amounts or paying any
such applicable early termination fees or penalties. If after the Closing Date any
Nonassignable Asset becomes assignable (either because consent for the assignment or
execution thereof is obtained or otherwise), Seller shall promptly notify Buyer and
cooperate to assign or transfer such previously Nonassignable Asset to Buyer or the

its attorney-in-fact to act in its name on its behalf or in the name of the applicable Affiliate
of Seller and on such Affiliate s behalf with respect thereto.

until any consent or approval with respect to any Nonassignable Asset is obtained, such

(a) Buyer and any Buyer Designee shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from

amounts as Buyer or any Buyer Designee, as applicable, is required to deduct and withhold
under the Code, or any Tax Law, with respect to the making of such payment. Such
withheld amounts shall be paid to the applicable Governmental Body. To the extent that 

-25-
amounts are so withheld and paid to the appropriate Governmental Body, such withheld
amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
Person in respect of whom such deduction and withholding was made. If Buyer or a Buyer
Designee intends to deduct or withhold on account of Taxes with respect to any payments
made pursuant to this Agreement, Buyer or such Buyer Designee shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to provide reasonable advance notice to Seller (or such other Person to
whom such amount is payable) of any amounts otherwise payable to Seller (or such other
Person) that it intends to deduct and withhold. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, and provided that Seller (or such other Person) provides the properly completed
Form W-8, Form W-9 or other similar forms, including any applicable non-U.S. Tax forms,
(as applicable) as the applicable Buyer or Buyer Designee reasonably requests and except
to the extent otherwise required by Law, Buyer or Buyer Designee shall not be entitled to
deduct and withhold from any amount payable or otherwise deliverable pursuant to this
Agreement any amounts of Tax. If withholding of Tax is required under this Section 2.8(a),
(i) Seller (or such other Person) shall be entitled to claim the benefit of any applicable Tax
treaty in any non-U.S. jurisdiction in which withholding is required, (ii) Buyer or the
applicable Buyer Designee shall reasonably cooperate in good faith with Seller (or other
Person, as applicable) to facilitate any such claim and to minimize or eliminate, to the
extent permitted by applicable Laws, any such withholding obligation, and (iii) Buyer or
the applicable Buyer Designee shall provide the Person in respect of whom withholding is
imposed such documentation to support such Person s claim of having paid the withheld
amounts to the applicable taxing authorities.

to be payable or to be borne under this Agreement is exclusive of any applicable Value
Added Taxes. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, any Taxes that
are Value Added Taxes imposed on assets sold hereunder, to the extent such Taxes are
fully recoverable by Buyer or the applicable Buyer Designee (or would have been
recoverable or not chargeable if Buyer had designated a local entity registered for Value
Added Tax purposes to acquire the assets and operate the acquired business in each
applicable country), shall be borne solely by Buyer or Buyer Designees, buy only to the
extent that a duly issued invoice has been provided by Seller or a Subsidiary to Buyer or
the applicable Buyer Designee, which invoice may be subject to adjustment following the
completion of the Asset Level Allocation Statement. In the case and to the extent of Value
Added Taxes incurred in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby that are
fully or partially recoverable by Buyer or a Buyer Designee, such Taxes shall be properly
invoiced by Seller or its Subsidiaries to Buyer or Buyer Designee, as applicable, paid by
Buyer or Buyer Designee to Seller or its Subsidiaries, as applicable, and remitted by Seller
or its Subsidiaries, as applicable, to the relevant Governmental Body in accordance with
applicable Law, and Buyer or Buyer Designee shall be entitled to such recovery. The Party
prescribed by Law as primarily liable for the payment of such Value Added Taxes shall 

-26-
prepare all necessary documents (including all Returns) with respect to all such amounts
in a timely manner. For the avoidance of doubt, any adjustment to such documents resulting
from changes to valuation shall not cause such documents to be considered untimely. The
Parties shall use reasonable efforts and cooperate in good faith to determine the appropriate
rate of Value Added Tax and/or, where available, to apply for specific relief for a transfer
of a going concern. Consistent with the other provisions of this Section Error! Reference
source not found., in the event that the competent Tax authority determines that the
transactions contemplated hereby do not qualify for such Value Added Taxes relief applied
by the Parties, Seller shall charge Buyer Value Added Taxes due on the transactions
contemplated hereby and deliver to Buyer a valid Value Added Taxes invoice within the
time as may be required by applicable Law. Value Added Taxes should be paid by Buyer
to Seller, in addition to the consideration payable pursuant to this Agreement, and Seller
shall remit the Value Added Taxes to the relevant Governmental Body, in each case, within
such timing as may be required or customary under applicable Law. Any related interest,
and/or penalties and/or surcharges imposed by the applicable Governmental Body related
to this Agreement will be paid by Seller, Buyer, or the Buyer's Designee, provided that the
fault is exclusively attributable to them. If the fault resulting in interest, penalties, and/or
surcharges is not exclusively attributable to one party, including any challenges to the
application of any applicable exemptions from Value Added Taxes (such as the transfer of
a going concern, zero-rating sales, etc.) as discussed and agreed by the Parties, then the
Parties shall bear the interest, penalties, and/or surcharges equally.

days of such Straddle Period, and Seller shall be liable for the proportionate amount of
Property Taxes that is attributable to the Pre-Closing Tax Period within such Straddle
Period, and Buyer shall be liable for the proportionate amount of Property Taxes that is
attributable to the Post-Closing Tax Period within such Straddle Period. Any refund,
rebate, abatement or other recovery of Property Taxes attributable to the Pre-Closing Tax
Period shall be for the account of Seller, and any refund, rebate, abatement or other
recovery of Property Taxes attributable to the Post-Closing Tax Period shall be for the
account of Buyer. Upon receipt of any bill (or any refund, rebate, abatement, or other
recovery) for such Property Taxes, Buyer or Seller, as applicable, shall present a statement
to the other setting forth the amount of reimbursement to which each is entitled under this
Section 2.8(d) together with such supporting evidence as is reasonably necessary to
calculate the proration amount. The proration amount shall be paid by the Party owing it
to the other within thirty (30) days after delivery of such statement. In the event that Buyer
or Seller makes any payment for which it is entitled to reimbursement under this Section
2.8(d), the applicable Party shall make such reimbursement promptly but in no event later
than thirty (30) days after the presentation of a statement setting forth the amount of
reimbursement to which the presenting Party is entitled along with such supporting
evidence as is reasonably necessary to calculate the amount of reimbursement. For the
avoidance of doubt, Seller shall be responsible for and shall promptly pay when due all
Property Taxes levied with respect to the Purchased Assets attributable to a Pre-Closing
Tax Period.

(e) Following the Closing, Buyer and Seller shall cooperate as reasonably
requested, so long as such request would not adversely impact Seller or its Affiliates, for
the purpose of enabling the requesting Party to (i) make any election relating to Taxes,
(ii) prepare Returns with respect to the Target Business or the Purchased Assets or (iii) to
prepare for and defend audits or other Tax-related examinations by a Governmental Body
with respect to the Target Business and the Purchased Assets.

penalties and interest) of any kind assessed against or relating to Seller and its Affiliates

a character or nature that would reasonably be expected to result in Liens (other than any
Lien for Taxes that are not yet due and payable) or claims on any of the Purchased Assets
or on Buyer s title or use of the Purchased Assets following the Closing or that would
reasonably be expected to result in any claim against or liability of Buyer.
2.9. Buyer Designee. The Parties agree that Buyer may assign the right to purchase
certain of the Purchased Assets to one or more Buyer Designees or that one or more Buyer
Designees may enter into a Collateral Agreement. Notwithstanding any such assignment or
execution of a Collateral Agreement by a Buyer Designee, Buyer shall remain liable for, and any
such assignment or execution shall not relieve Buyer of, its obligations hereunder or thereunder.
Any reference to Buyer in this Agreement shall to the extent applicable also be deemed a reference
to the applicable Buyer Designee, except where in context of this Agreement such use would not
be appropriate.

conveyance and delivery by Seller and the Subsidiaries of the Purchased Assets to Buyer or a
Buyer Designee, Buyer and/or a Buyer Designee(s) shall (i) pay to Seller or the applicable

benefits under the plans and arrangements provided by Buyer or a Buyer Designee to its
similarly situated employees unless Buyer or a Buyer Designee is required by applicable

thereunder, in which case Buyer or Buyer Designee shall provide such required benefits.
Seller and any applicable Subsidiary shall cooperate and assist in facilitating Buyer s or a
Buyer Designee s offers and will not take any action, or cause any of the Subsidiaries to
take any action, which would impede, hinder, interfere or otherwise compete with Buyer s

of the Business Employees to Buyer or a Buyer Designee, including with respect to notice

Subsidiary prior to the Closing for purposes of determining eligibility to participate and
vesting in each employee benefit plan of Buyer or a Buyer Designee, including but not
limited to any vacation plans and severance plans, to the extent permitted by applicable
Law, provided that such service shall not be recognized to the extent such recognition
would result in a duplication of benefits or would not be allowed by the applicable
employee benefit plan of Buyer or a Buyer Designee, as applicable.
(c) Effective as of the Closing, Seller or the applicable Subsidiary will
terminate the employment of any Business Employee who is offered employment in
accordance with Section 5.4(a) above and rejects such offer of employment with Buyer or

eligible for any severance benefits under the terms of any Benefit Plan.

notification may be required under the WARN Act as a result of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Seller will be responsible for providing any notification
that may be required under the WARN Act with respect to any of its employees terminated
on or prior to Closing. Buyer will be responsible for providing any notification that may
be required under the WARN Act with respect to any Transferred Employees terminated
after the Closing Date. In addition, Seller shall, at its own expense, give all notices and
other information required to be given by Seller to the Business Employees pursuant to
COBRA, if any, in connection with the execution of this Agreement and the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby and shall be solely responsible for providing
continuation coverage under COBRA.
(f) No provision of this Section 5.4 shall create any Third Party beneficiary or
other rights in any Business Employee or former employee in respect of continued or
resumed employment in Seller s business, or with Buyer, and no provision of this
Section 5.4 shall create any rights in any such persons in respect of any benefits that may
be provided under any plan or arrangement which may be established by Buyer. Nothing
contained herein shall be construed as requiring, and Seller, Buyer and their Affiliates shall

respective Affiliates to continue any specific Benefit Plan. The provisions of this
Section 5.4 are for the sole benefit of Seller and Buyer and nothing in this Section 5.4,
expressed or implied, is intended or shall be construed to constitute an amendment of any
Benefit Plan or any similar benefit plan of Buyer (or an undertaking to amend any such
plan) or other compensation and benefits plan maintained for or provided to Business
Employees, including Transferred Employees, prior to, on or following the Closing.
(g) To the extent to which a Transferred Employee would be in breach of any
obligation owed to Seller or one of its Affiliates by reason of becoming employed by Buyer
or a Buyer Designee (for example, a noncompete obligation), Seller and its Affiliates will
waive such obligation. 

-58-
(h) Subject to applicable Law, nothing in this Agreement shall require Buyer or

never been contained herein. It is the intention of the Parties that if any of the restrictions
or covenants contained herein is held to cover a geographic area or to be for a length of
time which is not permitted by applicable Law, or in any way construed to be too broad or
to any extent invalid, such provision shall not be construed to be null, void and of no effect,

Indemnifying Party may reasonably request, but failure to give such notice shall not relieve
the Indemnifying Party of any liability hereunder (unless and to the extent that the
Indemnifying Party has suffered material prejudice by such failure). The Indemnifying
Party shall have the right, but not the obligation, exercisable by written notice to the
Indemnified Party within twenty (20) days of receipt of notice from the Indemnified Party
of the commencement of or assertion of such Third Party Claim, to assume the defense and
control the settlement of any such Third Party Claim. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Article 9, if the Indemnified Party is a Buyer Indemnified Party,
then the Indemnifying Party shall not have the option to assume the defense of any such
Third Party Claim (i) which seeks any remedy other than monetary damages, (ii) which
claim, or the assumption by Seller of the defense of which claim, Buyer Indemnified Party
reasonably determines (A) could materially adversely affect the continuing business

any of its Affiliates has a material business relationship, (B) would reasonably pose
significant regulatory or reputational risk or exposure to Buyer Indemnified Party or (C) is

Body (in which cases Buyer Indemnified Party shall have the right to control the defense
of such matter and Seller shall have the right to participate in the defense of such matter at 

-76-
their own cost and expense), or (iii) which claim is covered by the R W Insurance Policy
and any claims, actions, suits, proceedings, liabilities, obligations, losses, and damages,
amounts paid in settlement, interest, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorney s
fees, court costs and other out-of-pocket expenses incurred in investigating, preparing or
defending the foregoing) (collectively, Losses arising from or relating to such Third
Party Claim are in excess (or are reasonably likely to be in excess) of the retention under
such R W Insurance Policy. Whether or not the Indemnifying Party exercises its right to
control the defense of any Third Party Claim as provided above, each Party shall cooperate
in the defense of such Third Party Claim and make available all witnesses, pertinent
records, materials and information in such Party s possession and control relating thereto
as is reasonably required in connection with the defense of such Third Party Claim.
(b) The Indemnifying Party or the Indemnified Party, as the case may be, shall
have the right to participate in (but not control), at its own expense, the defense of any
Third Party Claim that the other is defending, as provided in this Agreement, excluding
any Third Party Claims relating to Taxes of the Indemnified Party.
(c) If the Indemnifying Party has assumed the defense of any Third Party Claim
as provided in this Agreement, the Indemnifying Party shall not settle, consent to a
settlement of, or consent to the entry of any judgment arising from, such Third Party Claim
without the Indemnified Party s prior written consent (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) unless (i) such settlement or judgment
relates solely to monetary damages for which the Indemnified Party has acknowledged and
accepted full responsibility to indemnify the Indemnified Party, and (ii) the terms of the
settlement include a full and unconditional release of the Indemnified Party and all of its
Affiliates in respect of the subject matter of such Third Party Claim and all related claims
and damages arising therefrom. The Indemnifying Party shall not, without the Indemnified
Party s prior written consent, enter into any compromise or settlement that (i) commits the
Indemnified Party to take, or to forbear to take, any action, or (ii) does not provide for a
full and unconditional release by such Third Party of the Indemnified Party.
(d) Whether or not the Indemnifying Party chooses to defend or prosecute any
Third Party Claim, both Parties hereto shall cooperate in the defense or prosecution thereof
and shall furnish such records, information and testimony, and attend such conferences,
discovery proceedings, hearings, trials and appeals, as may be reasonably requested in
connection therewith or as provided in Section 5.1.
9.9. Indemnification Claim Procedures Generally. In the event an Indemnified Party
shall claim a right to indemnification pursuant to this Agreement other than a claim pursuant to
Section 9.3(a), such Indemnified Party shall send written notice of such indemnification claim to
the Indemnifying Party (each such notice, a Claim Notice ); provided, however, that the failure
to give such notice shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of any liability hereunder (unless and
to the extent that the Indemnifying Party has suffered material prejudice by such failure). Any
Claim Notice shall specify the basis for such claim, the amount thereof, if known (or a reasonable
estimate if not known), and the method of computation thereof, all with reasonable particularity
and shall contain a reference to the provisions of this Agreement in respect of which such a claim
shall be incurred. Such Claim Notice shall be given as promptly as is reasonably practicable after 

-77-
the Indemnified Party becomes aware of the basis for each such a claim. If the Indemnifying Party
in good faith objects to any claim made by an Indemnified Party in any such Claim Notice, then
the Indemnifying Party shall deliver a written notice (a Claim Dispute Notice to the Indemnified
Party during the thirty (30)-day period commencing upon receipt by the Indemnifying Party of
such Claim Notice. Such Claim Dispute Notice shall set forth in reasonable detail the principal
basis for the dispute of any claim made by the Indemnified Party in the original Claim Notice. If
the Indemnifying Party so contests the existence of an obligation to indemnify or the amount of
part or all of such Loss, the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party shall work in good faith
to resolve any dispute in respect of such Loss for a period of thirty (30) days, after which the
Indemnified Party or Indemnifying Party may submit such dispute to any court of competent
jurisdiction. If the Indemnifying Party does not deliver a Claim Dispute Notice to the Indemnified
Party prior to expiration of the thirty (30)-day period or if the matters set forth in such Claim
Dispute Notice are resolved, then the Indemnifying Party shall be deemed to have accepted the
claim for indemnification set forth in such Claim Notice and shall pay such amount to the
Indemnified Party.
9.10. Treatment of Indemnification Payments. Amounts payable in respect of the
Parties indemnification obligations shall be treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price for Tax

by law.

Party from any liability for any material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant, or
agreement hereunder prior to termination or any Fraud.

provision contained herein at any time prior to the Closing Date by action of the Parties hereto

prior to the Closing Date by the Party hereto which is entitled to the benefits thereof by action
taken by its Board of Directors or its duly authorized officer or employee, whether before or after
the action of such Party. Any such amendment or waiver shall be evidenced by a written
instrument duly executed on behalf of each Party by its duly authorized officer or employee. The
failure of either Party to enforce at any time any provision of this Agreement shall not be construed
to be a waiver of such provision nor shall it in any way affect the validity of this Agreement or the
right of such Party thereafter to enforce each and every such provision. No waiver of any breach
of this Agreement shall be held to constitute a waiver of any other or subsequent breach.
