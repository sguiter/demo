CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 This report contains forward-looking statements that involve substantial risks and uncertainties. These forward-looking statements are not historical facts, but rather are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about us, our current and prospective portfolio investments, our industry, our beliefs, and our assumptions. Words such as anticipates, expects, intends, plans, believes, seeks, estimates, would, should, targets, projects, and variations of these words and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks, uncertainties, and other factors, some of which are beyond our control and difficult to predict, that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or forecasted in the forward-looking statements. 
 In addition to factors previously identified elsewhere in the reports and other documents Sixth Street Specialty Lending, Inc. (the "Company", "we", "us", or "our") has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, the following factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ materially from forward-looking statements or historical performance: 
 an economic downturn, which could impair our portfolio companies abilities to continue to operate, and could lead to the loss of some or all of our investments in those portfolio companies; 

such an economic downturn could disproportionately impact the companies in which we have invested and others that we intend to target for investment, potentially causing us to experience a decrease in investment opportunities and diminished demand for capital from these companies; 

such an economic downturn could also impact availability and pricing of our financing; 

an inability to access the capital markets could impair our ability to raise capital and our investment activities; 

inflation could negatively impact our business, including our ability to access the debt markets on favorable terms, or could negatively impact our portfolio companies; and 

the risks, uncertainties and other factors we identify in the section entitled Risk Factors in this report, in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on February 15, 2024, and elsewhere in our filings with the SEC. 

Although we believe that the assumptions on which these forward-looking statements are based are reasonable, some of those assumptions are based on the work of third parties and any of those assumptions could prove to be inaccurate; as a result, forward-looking statements based on those assumptions also could prove to be inaccurate. In light of these and other uncertainties, the inclusion of a projection or forward-looking statement in this report should not be regarded as a representation by us that our plans and objectives will be achieved. You should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which apply only as of the date of this report. We do not undertake any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements or any other information contained herein, except as required by applicable law. 
 The TSLX and TAO marks are marks of Sixth Street.

of its investment company taxable income, as defined by the Code, and net tax-exempt income for that taxable year. To maintain its RIC status, the Company, among other things, has made and intends to continue to make the requisite distributions to its stockholders, which generally relieves the Company from corporate-level U.S. federal income taxes. The Company evaluates tax positions taken or expected to be taken in the course of preparing its financial statements to determine whether the tax positions are more-likely-than-not to be sustained by the applicable tax authority. Tax positions not deemed to meet the more-likely-than-not threshold are reserved and recorded as a tax benefit or expense in the current year. All penalties and interest associated with income taxes are included in income tax expense. Conclusions regarding tax positions are subject to review and may be adjusted at a later date based on factors including, but not limited to, on-going analyses of tax laws, regulations and interpretations thereof. Depending on the level of taxable income earned in a tax year, the Company can be expected to carry forward taxable income (including net capital gains, if any) in excess of current year dividend distributions from the current tax year into the next tax year and pay a nondeductible U.S. federal excise tax on such taxable income, as required. To the extent that the Company determines that the estimated current year annual taxable income will be in excess of estimated current year dividend distributions from such income, the Company accrues excise tax on estimated excess taxable income. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded a net expense of million and million, respectively, for U.S. federal excise tax and other taxes. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 , the Company recorded a net expense of million and million, respectively, for U.S. federal excise tax and other taxes. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , the Company recorded a deferred tax expense of million pertaining to net unrealized gains, related to eight of its investments. As of the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, there was no recorded deferred tax expense. The Company changed its tax year end from March 31st to December 31st.

days written notice to the other party. No person who is an officer, director or employee of the Adviser or its affiliates and who serves as a director of the Company receives any compensation from the Company for his or her services as a director. However, the Company reimburses the Adviser (or its affiliates) for the allocable portion of the costs of compensation, benefits, and related administrative expenses of the Company s officers who provide operational and administrative services to the Company pursuant to the Administration Agreement, their respective staffs and other professionals who provide services to the Company (including, in each case, employees of the Adviser or an affiliate). Such reimbursable amounts include the allocable portion of the compensation paid by the Adviser or its affiliates to the Company s Chief Financial Officer, Chief Compliance Officer, and other professionals who provide operational and administrative services to the Company pursuant to the Administration Agreement, including individuals who provide back office or middle office financial, operational, legal and/or compliance services to the Company. The Company reimburses the Adviser (or its affiliates) for the allocable portion of the compensation paid by the Adviser (or its affiliates) to such individuals based on the percentage of time those individuals devote, on an estimated basis, to the business and affairs of the Company and in acting on behalf of the Company. The Company may also reimburse the Adviser or its affiliates for the allocable portion of overhead expenses (including rent, office equipment and utilities) attributable thereto. Directors who are not affiliated with the Adviser receive compensation for their services and reimbursement of expenses incurred to attend meetings. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 the Company incurred expenses of million and million, respectively, for administrative services payable to the Adviser under the terms of the Administration Agreement, which is included in other general and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 , the Company incurred expenses of million and million, respectively, for administrative services payable to the Adviser under the terms of the Administration Agreement. Investment Advisory Agreement On April 15, 2011, the Company entered into the Investment Advisory Agreement with the Adviser. The Investment Advisory Agreement was subsequently amended on December 12, 2011. Under the terms of the Investment Advisory Agreement, the Adviser provides investment advisory services to the Company. The Adviser s services under the Investment Advisory Agreement are not exclusive, and the Adviser is free to furnish similar or other services to others so long as its services to the Company are not impaired.

based on the average value of the Company s gross assets calculated using the values at the end of the two most recently completed calendar quarters, adjusted for any share issuances or repurchases during the period. The Management Fee is payable quarterly in arrears. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, Management Fees (gross of waivers) were million and million, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 , Management Fees (gross of waivers) were million and million, respectively. Any waived Management Fees are not subject to recoupment by the Adviser. The Adviser intends to waive a portion of the Management Fee payable under the Investment Advisory Agreement by reducing the Management Fee on assets financed using leverage over asset coverage (in other words, over 1.0x debt to equity) (the Leverage Waiver ). Pursuant to the Leverage Waiver, the Adviser intends to waive the portion of the Management Fee in excess of an annual rate of per quarter) on the average value of the Company's gross assets as of the end of the two most recently completed calendar quarters that exceeds the product of (i) and (ii) the average value of our net asset value at the end of the two most recently completed calendar quarters. The Adviser waived Management Fees of million and million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 pursuant to the Leverage Waiver. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 , the Adviser waived Management Fees of million and million, respectively, pursuant to the Leverage Waiver. The Incentive Fee consists of two parts, as follows: 1. The first component, payable at the end of each quarter in arrears, equals of the pre-Incentive Fee net investment income in excess of a quarterly hurdle rate, the calculation of which is further explained below, until the Adviser has received of the total pre-Incentive Fee net investment income for that quarter and, for pre-Incentive Fee net investment income in excess of quarterly, of all remaining pre-Incentive Fee net investment income for that quarter. The catch-up provision for pre-Incentive Fee net investment income in excess of the hurdle rate is intended to provide the Adviser with an Incentive Fee of on all pre-Incentive Fee net investment income when that amount equals in a quarter annualized), which is the rate at which catch-up is achieved. Once the hurdle rate is reached and catch-up is achieved, of any pre-Incentive Fee net investment income in excess of in any quarter is payable to the Adviser. 

 Pre-Incentive Fee net investment income means dividends, interest and fee income accrued by the Company during the calendar quarter, minus the Company s operating expenses for the quarter (including the Management Fee, expenses payable under the Administration Agreement to the Administrator, and any interest expense and dividends paid on any issued and outstanding preferred stock, but excluding the Incentive Fee). Pre-Incentive Fee net investment income includes, in the case of investments with a deferred interest feature (such as original issue discount, debt instruments with pay-in-kind interest and zero coupon securities), accrued income that the Company may not have received in cash. Pre-Incentive Fee net investment income does not include any realized capital gains, realized capital losses or unrealized capital gains or losses. 2. The second component, payable at the end of each fiscal year in arrears, equaled through March 31, 2014 and, beginning April 1, 2014, equals a weighted percentage of cumulative realized capital gains from the Company s inception to the end of that fiscal year, less cumulative realized capital losses and unrealized capital losses. This component of the Incentive Fee is referred to as the Capital Gains Fee. Each year, the fee paid for this component of the Incentive Fee is net of the aggregate amount of any previously paid Capital Gains Fee for prior periods. For capital gains that accrue following March 31, 2014, the Incentive Fee rate is . The Company accrues, but does not pay, a capital gains Incentive Fee with respect to unrealized capital gains because a capital gains Incentive Fee would be owed to the Adviser if the Company were to sell the relevant investment and realize a capital gain. The weighted percentage is intended to ensure that for each fiscal year following the completion of the IPO, the portion of the Company s realized capital gains that accrued prior to March 31, 2014, is subject to an Incentive Fee rate of and the portion of the Company s realized capital gains that accrued beginning April 1, 2014 is subject to an Incentive Fee rate of . In the determination of the second component of the Incentive Fee, any unrealized gains/(losses) specifically related to the foreign currency denominated borrowings of non-US dollar denominated investments is offset against any associated unrealized gains/(losses) related to foreign currency denominated investments. As of March 31, 2020, there were remaining investments that were made prior to April 1, 2014, and as a result, the Incentive Fee rate of is applicable to any future realized capital gains. 

 For purposes of determining whether pre-Incentive Fee net investment income exceeds the hurdle rate, pre-Incentive Fee net investment income is expressed as a rate of return on the value of the Company s net assets at the end of the immediately preceding calendar quarter.

million and million, respectively, of which million and million, respectively, were realized and payable to the Adviser. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 , Incentive Fees were million and million, respectively, of which million and million, respectively, were realized and payable to the Adviser. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, million and million, respectively, of Incentive Fees was accrued related to the reversal of Capital Gains Fees. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 , million and million, respectively, of Incentive Fees were accrued related to Capital Gains Fees. As of September 30, 2024, the Capital Gains Fees accrued are not contractually payable to the Adviser. Any waived Incentive Fees are not subject to recoupment by the Adviser. Since the Company s IPO, with the exception of its waiver of Management Fees and certain Incentive Fees attributable to the Company s ownership of certain investments and the Leverage Waiver, the Adviser has not waived its right to receive any Management Fees or Incentive Fees payable pursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement. In November 2024, the Board renewed the Investment Advisory Agreement. Unless earlier terminated as described below, the Investment Advisory Agreement will remain in effect until November 2025, and may be extended subject to required approvals. The Investment Advisory Agreement will automatically terminate in the event of an assignment and may be terminated by either party without penalty on days written notice to the other party. From time to time, the Adviser may pay amounts owed by the Company to third-party providers of goods or services, including the Board, and the Company will subsequently reimburse the Adviser for such amounts paid on its behalf. Amounts payable to the Adviser are settled in the normal course of business without formal payment terms.

The Company typically determines the fair value of its performing Level 3 debt investments utilizing a yield analysis. In a yield analysis, a price is ascribed for each investment based upon an assessment of current and expected market yields for similar investments and risk profiles. Additional consideration is given to the expected life, portfolio company performance since close, and other terms and risks associated with an investment. Among other factors, a determinant of risk is the amount of leverage used by the portfolio company relative to the total enterprise value of the company, and the rights and remedies of our investment within each portfolio company s capital structure. Significant unobservable quantitative inputs typically considered in the fair value measurement of the Company s Level 3 debt investments primarily include current market yields, including relevant market indices, but may also include quotes from brokers, dealers, and pricing services as indicated by comparable investments. If debt investments are credit impaired, an enterprise value analysis may be used to value such debt investments; however, in addition to the methods outlined above, other methods such as a liquidation or wind-down analysis may be utilized to estimate enterprise value. For the Company s Level 3 equity investments, multiples of similar companies revenues, earnings before income taxes, depreciation and amortization EBITDA or some combination thereof and comparable market transactions are typically used. Financial Instruments Not Carried at Fair Value Debt The fair value of the Company s Revolving Credit Facility, which is categorized as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy, as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, approximates its carrying value as the outstanding balance is callable at carrying value.

Relationship with our Adviser and Sixth Street 
 Our Adviser is a Delaware limited liability company. Our Adviser acts as our investment adviser and administrator and is a registered investment adviser with the SEC under the Advisers Act. Our Adviser sources and manages our portfolio through a dedicated team of investment professionals predominately focused on direct lending, which we refer to as our Investment Team. Our Investment Team is led by our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and our Adviser s Co-Chief Investment Officer Joshua Easterly and our Adviser s Co-Chief Investment Officer Alan Waxman, both of whom have substantial experience in credit origination, underwriting and asset management. Our investment decisions are made by our Investment Review Committee, which includes senior personnel of our Adviser and affiliates of Sixth Street Partners, LLC, or Sixth Street. 
 Sixth Street is a global investment business with over 80 billion of assets under management as of September 30, 2024. Sixth Street s direct lending platforms include Sixth Street Specialty Lending, Sixth Street Lending Partners, which is aimed at U.S. upper middle-market loan originations, Sixth Street Specialty Lending Europe, which is aimed at European middle-market loan originations. Additional Sixth Street core platforms include Sixth Street TAO, which has the flexibility to invest across all of Sixth Street s private credit market investments, Sixth Street Opportunities, which focuses on actively managed opportunistic investments across the credit cycle, Sixth Street Credit Market Strategies, which is the firm s public-side credit investment platform focused on investment opportunities in broadly syndicated leveraged loan markets, Sixth Street Growth, which provides financing solutions to growing companies, Sixth Street Fundamental Strategies, which primarily invests in secondary credit, and Sixth Street Agriculture, which invests in niche agricultural opportunities. Sixth Street has a long-term oriented, highly flexible capital base that allows it to invest across industries, geographies, capital structures and asset classes. Sixth Street has extensive experience with highly complex, global public and private investments executed through primary originations, secondary market purchases and restructurings, and has a team of over 650 investment and operating professionals. As of September 30, 2024, sixty-nine (69) of these personnel are dedicated to direct lending, including fifty-four (54) investment professionals. 
 Our Adviser consults with Sixth Street in connection with a substantial number of our investments. The Sixth Street platform provides us with a breadth of large and scalable investment resources. We believe we benefit from Sixth Street s market expertise, 
 50 

insights into industry, sector and macroeconomic trends and intensive due diligence capabilities, which help us discern market conditions that vary across industries and credit cycles, identify favorable investment opportunities and manage our portfolio of investments. Sixth Street and its affiliates will refer all middle-market loan origination activities for companies domiciled in the United States to us and conduct those activities through us. The Adviser will determine whether it would be permissible, advisable or otherwise appropriate for us to pursue a particular investment opportunity allocated to us. 
 On December 16, 2014, we were granted an exemptive order from the SEC that allows us to co-invest, subject to certain conditions and to the extent the size of an investment opportunity exceeds the amount our Adviser has independently determined is appropriate to invest, with certain of our affiliates (including affiliates of Sixth Street) in middle-market loan origination activities for companies domiciled in the United States and certain follow-on investments in companies in which we have already co-invested pursuant to the order and remain invested. On January 16, 2020, we filed a further application for co-investment exemptive relief with the SEC to better align our existing co-investment relief with more recent SEC exemptive orders. Subsequent further applications were also made, most recently as June 29, 2022. On August 3, 2022, the SEC granted the new order in response to our application. 
 We believe our ability to co-invest with Sixth Street affiliates is particularly useful where we identify larger capital commitments than otherwise would be appropriate for us. We expect that with the ability to co-invest with Sixth Street affiliates we will continue to be able to provide one-stop financing to a potential portfolio company in these circumstances, which may allow us to capture opportunities where we alone could not commit the full amount of required capital or would have to spend additional time to locate unaffiliated co-investors. 
 Under the terms of the Investment Advisory Agreement and Administration Agreement, the Adviser s services are not exclusive, and the Adviser is free to furnish similar or other services to others, so long as its services to us are not impaired. Under the terms of the Investment Advisory Agreement, we will pay the Adviser the base management fee, or the Management Fee, and may also pay certain incentive fees, or the Incentive Fees. 
 Under the terms of the Administration Agreement, the Adviser also provides administrative services to us. These services include providing office space, equipment and office services, maintaining financial records, preparing reports to stockholders and reports filed with the SEC, and managing the payment of expenses and the oversight of the performance of administrative and professional services rendered by others. Certain of these services are reimbursable to the Adviser under the terms of the Administration Agreement. 
 Key Components of Our Results of Operations 
 Investments 
 We focus primarily on the direct origination of loans to middle-market companies domiciled in the United States. 
 Our level of investment activity (both the number of investments and the size of each investment) can and does vary substantially from period to period depending on many factors, including the amount of debt and equity capital generally available to middle-market companies, the level of merger and acquisition activity for such companies, the general economic environment and the competitive environment for the types of investments we make. 
 In addition, as part of our risk strategy on investments, we may reduce certain levels of investments through partial sales or syndication to additional investors. 
 Revenues 
 We generate revenues primarily in the form of interest income from the investments we hold. In addition, we may generate income from dividends on direct equity investments, capital gains on the sale of investments and various loan origination and other fees. Our debt investments typically have a term of two to seven years, and, as of September 30, 2024, 98.8 of these investments based on fair value bore interest at a floating rate, with 100.0 of these subject to interest rate floors. Interest on debt investments is generally payable monthly or quarterly. Some of our investments provide for deferred interest payments or PIK interest. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, 5.2 and 6.6 respectively, of our total investment income was comprised of PIK interest. 
 Changes in our net investment income are primarily driven by the spread between the payments we receive from our investments in our portfolio companies against our cost of funding, rather than by changes in interest rates. Our investment portfolio primarily consists of floating rate loans, and our credit facilities, 2024 Notes, 2026 Notes, 2028 Notes and 2029 Notes, after taking into account the effect of the interest rate swaps we have entered into in connection with these securities, all bear interest at floating rates. Macro trends in base interest rates like SOFR or other reference rates may affect our net investment income over the long term. However, because we generally originate loans to a limited number of portfolio companies each quarter, and those investments also vary in size, 
 51 

our results in any given period including the interest rate on investments that were sold or repaid in a period compared to the interest rate of new investments made during that period often are idiosyncratic, and reflect the characteristics of the particular portfolio companies that we invested in or exited during the period and not necessarily any trends in our business. 
 In addition to interest income, our net investment income is also driven by prepayment and other fees, which also can vary significantly from quarter to quarter. The level of prepayment fees is generally correlated to the movement in credit spreads and risk premiums, but also will vary based on corporate events that may take place at an individual portfolio company in a given period e.g., merger and acquisition activity, initial public offerings and restructurings. As noted above, generally a small but varied number of portfolio companies may make prepayments in any quarter, meaning that changes in the amount of prepayment fees received can vary significantly between periods and can vary without regard to underlying credit trends. 
 Loan origination fees, original issue discount and market discount or premium are capitalized, and we accrete or amortize such amounts as interest income using the effective interest method for term instruments and the straight-line method for revolving or delayed draw instruments. Repayments of our debt investments can reduce interest income from period to period. We record prepayment premiums on loans as interest income when earned. We also may generate revenue in the form of commitment, amendment, structuring, syndication or due diligence fees, fees for providing managerial assistance and consulting fees. The frequency or volume of these items of revenue may fluctuate significantly. 
 Dividend income on common equity investments is recorded on the record date for private portfolio companies or on the ex-dividend date for publicly traded portfolio companies. 
 Our portfolio activity also reflects the proceeds of sales of investments. We recognize realized gains or losses on investments based on the difference between the net proceeds from the disposition and the amortized cost basis of the investment without regard to unrealized gains or losses previously recognized. We record current period changes in fair value of investments that are measured at fair value as a component of the net change in unrealized gains (losses) on investments in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
 Expenses 
 Our primary operating expenses include the payment of fees to our Adviser under the Investment Advisory Agreement, expenses reimbursable under the Administration Agreement and other operating costs described below. Additionally, we pay interest expense on our outstanding debt. We bear all other costs and expenses of our operations, administration and transactions, including those relating to: 
 calculating individual asset values and our net asset value (including the cost and expenses of any independent valuation firms); 

expenses, including travel expenses, incurred by the Adviser, or members of our Investment Team, or payable to third parties, in respect of due diligence on prospective portfolio companies and, if necessary, in respect of enforcing our rights with respect to investments in existing portfolio companies; 

the costs of any public offerings of our common stock and other securities, including registration and listing fees; 

the Management Fee and any Incentive Fee; 

certain costs and expenses relating to distributions paid on our shares; 

administration fees payable under our Administration Agreement; 

costs of preparing financial statements and maintaining books and records and filing reports or other documents with the SEC (or other regulatory bodies) and other reporting and compliance costs, and the compensation of professionals responsible for the preparation of the foregoing, including the allocable portion of the compensation of our Chief Financial Officer, Chief Compliance Officer and other professionals who spend time on those related activities (based on the percentage of time those individuals devote, on an estimated basis, to our business and affairs); 

debt service and other costs of borrowings or other financing arrangements; 

the Adviser s allocable share of costs incurred in providing significant managerial assistance to those portfolio companies that request it; 

amounts payable to third parties relating to, or associated with, making or holding investments; 

transfer agent and custodial fees; 

costs of hedging; 

commissions and other compensation payable to brokers or dealers; 

52 

taxes; 

Independent Director fees and expenses; 

the costs of any reports, proxy statements or other notices to our stockholders (including printing and mailing costs), the costs of any stockholders meetings and the compensation of investor relations personnel responsible for the preparation of the foregoing and related matters; 

our fidelity bond; 

directors and officers/errors and omissions liability insurance, and any other insurance premiums; 

indemnification payments; 

direct costs and expenses of administration, including audit, accounting, consulting and legal costs; and 

all other expenses reasonably incurred by us in connection with making investments and administering our business. 

We expect that during periods of asset growth, our general and administrative expenses will be relatively stable or will decline as a percentage of total assets, and will increase as a percentage of total assets during periods of asset declines. 
 Leverage 
 While as a BDC the amount of leverage that we are permitted to use is limited in significant respects, we use leverage to increase our ability to make investments. The amount of leverage we use in any period depends on a variety of factors, including cash available for investing, the cost of financing and general economic and market conditions, however, under the 1940 Act, our total borrowings are limited so that our asset coverage ratio cannot fall below 150 immediately after any borrowing, as defined in the 1940 Act. In any period, our interest expense will depend largely on the extent of our borrowing and we expect interest expense will increase as we increase leverage over time within the limits of the 1940 Act. In addition, we may dedicate assets as collateral to financing facilities from time to time. 
 Market Trends 
 We believe trends in the middle-market lending environment, including the limited availability of capital from traditional regulated financial institutions, strong demand for debt capital and specialized lending requirements, are likely to continue to create favorable opportunities for us to invest at attractive risk-adjusted rates. 
 Subsequent to the global financial crisis, the implementation of regulatory changes such as Basel III requirements, Leverage Lending Guidance, and the Volcker Rule, tightened risk appetites and reduced the capacity of traditional lenders to serve middle-market companies. We believe that these dynamics create a significant opportunity for us to directly originate investments. We also believe that the large amount of uninvested capital held by private equity firms will continue to drive deal activity, which may in turn create additional demand for debt capital. 
 This market dynamic is further exacerbated by the specialized due diligence and underwriting capabilities, as well as extensive ongoing monitoring, required for middle-market lending. We believe middle-market lending is generally more labor-intensive than lending to larger companies due to smaller investment sizes and the lack of publicly available information on these companies. As a result, the opportunities for dedicated private lenders such as us has continued to expand. 
 An imbalance between the supply of, and demand for, middle-market debt capital creates attractive pricing dynamics for investors such as BDCs. The negotiated nature of middle-market financings also generally provides for more favorable terms to the lenders, including stronger covenant and reporting packages, better call protection and lender-protective change of control provisions. We believe that BDCs have flexibility to develop loans that reflect each borrower s distinct situation, provide long-term relationships and a potential source for future capital, which renders BDCs, including us, attractive lenders.

(1) Loans are generally placed on non-accrual status when principal or interest payments are past due 30 days or more or when management has reasonable doubt that the borrower will pay principal or interest in full. Accrued and unpaid interest is generally reversed when a loan is placed on non-accrual status. Non-accrual loans are restored to accrual status when past due principal and interest has been paid and, in management s judgment, the borrower is likely to make principal and interest payments in the future. Management may determine to not place a loan on non-accrual status if, notwithstanding any failure to pay, the loan has sufficient collateral value and is in the process of collection.

The Adviser monitors our portfolio companies on an ongoing basis. The Adviser monitors the financial trends of each portfolio company to determine if it is meeting its business plans and to assess the appropriate course of action for each company. The Adviser has a number of methods of evaluating and monitoring the performance of our investments, which may include the following: 
 assessment of success of the portfolio company in adhering to its business plan and compliance with covenants; 

periodic and regular contact with portfolio company management and, if appropriate, the financial or strategic sponsor, to discuss financial position, requirements and accomplishments; 

comparisons to other companies in the industry; 

attendance at, and participation in, board meetings; and 

review of monthly and quarterly financial statements and financial projections for portfolio companies. 

55 

As part of the monitoring process, the Adviser regularly assesses the risk profile of each of our investments and, on a quarterly basis, grades each investment on a risk scale of 1 to 5. Risk assessment is not standardized in our industry and our risk assessment may not be comparable to ones used by our competitors. Our assessment is based on the following categories: 
 An investment is rated 1 if, in the opinion of the Adviser, it is performing as agreed and there are no concerns about the portfolio company s performance or ability to meet covenant requirements. For these investments, the Adviser generally prepares monthly reports on investment performance and intensive quarterly asset reviews. 

An investment is rated 2 if it is performing as agreed, but, in the opinion of the Adviser, there may be concerns about the company s operating performance or trends in the industry. For these investments, in addition to monthly reports and quarterly asset reviews, the Adviser also researches any areas of concern with the objective of early intervention with the portfolio company. 

An investment will be assigned a rating of 3 if it is paying its obligations to us as agreed but a material covenant violation is expected. For these investments, in addition to monthly reports and quarterly asset reviews, the Adviser also adds the investment to its watch list and researches any areas of concern with the objective of early intervention with the portfolio company. 

An investment will be assigned a rating of 4 if a material covenant has been violated, but the company is making its scheduled payments on its obligations to us. For these investments, the Adviser generally prepares a bi-monthly asset review email and generally has monthly meetings with the portfolio company s senior management. For investments where there have been material defaults, including bankruptcy filings, failures to achieve financial performance requirements or failure to maintain liquidity or loan-to-value requirements, the Adviser often will take immediate action to protect its position. These remedies may include negotiating for additional collateral, modifying investment terms or structure, or payment of amendment and waiver fees. 

A rating of 5 indicates an investment is in default on its interest and/or principal payments. For these investments, our Adviser reviews the investments on a bi-monthly basis and, where possible, pursues workouts that achieve an early resolution to avoid further deterioration of our investment. The Adviser retains legal counsel and takes actions to preserve our rights, which may include working with the portfolio company to have the default cured, to have the investment restructured or to have the investment repaid through a consensual workout. 

The following table shows the distribution of our investments on the 1 to 5 investment performance rating scale at fair value as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Investment performance ratings are accurate only as of those dates and may change due to subsequent developments relating to a portfolio company s business or financial condition, market conditions or developments, and other factors.

Interest from investments, which includes amortization of upfront fees and prepayment fees, increased from 104.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 105.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024. The increase in interest from investments was primarily the result of a larger average portfolio size for the period ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. Paid-in-kind interest income increased from 5.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 6.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 due to increased PIK election. Dividend income increased from 0.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 3.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 due to increased investments in dividend yielding securities compared to the same period in 2023. Other income decreased from 4.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 3.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to decreased amendment fees during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. 
 Interest from investments, which includes amortization of upfront fees and prepayment fees, increased from 292.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 315.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The increase in interest from investments was primarily the result of a larger average portfolio size for the period ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. Paid-in-kind interest income increased from 12.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 23.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 due to increased PIK election. Dividend income increased from 2.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 5.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 due to increased investments in dividend yielding securities compared to the same period in 2023. Other income increased from 11.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 13.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to increased arranger and miscellaneous fees during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023.

 Income Taxes, Including Excise Taxes 
 We have elected to be treated as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code, and we intend to operate in a manner so as to continue to qualify for the tax treatment applicable to RICs. To qualify as a RIC, we must, among other things, distribute to our stockholders in each taxable year generally at least 90 of our investment company taxable income, as defined by the Code, and net tax-exempt income for that taxable year. To maintain our RIC status, we, among other things, have made and intend to continue to make the requisite distributions to our stockholders, which generally relieve us from corporate-level U.S. federal income taxes. 
 Depending on the level of taxable income earned in a tax year, we can be expected to carry forward taxable income (including net capital gains, if any) in excess of current year dividend distributions from the current tax year into the next tax year and pay a nondeductible 4 U.S. federal excise tax on such taxable income, as required. To the extent that we determine that our estimated current year annual taxable income will be in excess of estimated current year dividend distributions from such income, we accrue excise tax on estimated excess taxable income. 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded a net expense of 0.7 million and 2.8 million, respectively, for U.S. federal excise tax and other taxes. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded a net expense of 0.5 million and 1.8 million, respectively, for U.S. federal excise tax and other taxes. 
 For of the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded a deferred tax expense of 1.5 million pertaining to net unrealized gains, related to eight of our investments. As of the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, there was no recorded deferred tax expense.

 Realized Gross Internal Rate of Return 
 Since we began investing in 2011 through September 30, 2024, weighted by capital invested, our exited investments have generated an average realized gross internal rate of return to us of 17.2 (based on total capital invested of 7.5 billion and total proceeds from these exited investments of 9.6 billion). Ninety two percent of these exited investments resulted in a realized gross internal rate of return to us of 10 or greater. 
 60 

Gross IRR, with respect to an investment, is calculated based on the dates that we invested capital and dates we received distributions, regardless of when we made distributions to our stockholders. Initial investments are assumed to occur at time zero, and all cash flows are deemed to occur on the fifteenth of each month in which they occur. 
 Gross IRR reflects historical results relating to our past performance and is not necessarily indicative of our future results. In addition, gross IRR does not reflect the effect of Management Fees, expenses, Incentive Fees or taxes borne, or to be borne, by us or our stockholders, and would be lower if it did. 
 Average gross IRR is the average of the gross IRR for each of our exited investments (each calculated as described above), weighted by the total capital invested for each of those investments. 
 Average gross IRR on our exited investments reflects only invested and realized cash amounts as described above, and does not reflect any unrealized gains or losses in our portfolio. 
 Internal rate of return, or IRR, is a measure of our discounted cash flows (inflows and outflows). Specifically, IRR is the discount rate at which the net present value of all cash flows is equal to zero. That is, IRR is the discount rate at which the present value of total capital invested in each of our investments is equal to the present value of all realized returns from that investment. Our IRR calculations are unaudited. 
 Capital invested, with respect to an investment, represents the aggregate cost basis allocable to the realized or unrealized portion of the investment, net of any upfront fees paid at closing for the term loan portion of the investment. Capital invested also includes realized losses on hedging activity, with respect to an investment, which represents any inception-to-date realized losses on foreign currency forward contracts allocable to the investment, if any. 
 Realized returns, with respect to an investment, represents the total cash received with respect to each investment, including all amortization payments, interest, dividends, prepayment fees, upfront fees, administrative fees, agent fees, amendment fees, accrued interest, and other fees and proceeds. Realized returns also include realized gains on hedging activity, with respect to an investment, which represents any inception-to-date realized gains on foreign currency forward contracts allocable to the investment, if any. 
 Interest Rate and Foreign Currency Hedging 
 We use interest rate swaps to hedge our fixed rate debt and certain fixed rate investments. We have designated certain interest rate swaps to be in a hedge accounting relationship. See Note 2 for additional disclosure regarding our accounting for derivative instruments designated in a hedge accounting relationship. See Note 5 for additional disclosure regarding these derivative instruments and the interest payments paid and received. See Note 7 for additional disclosure regarding the carrying value of our debt. 
 Our current approach to hedging the foreign currency exposure in our non-U.S. dollar denominated investments is primarily to borrow the par amount in local currency under our Revolving Credit Facility to fund these investments. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we had unrealized losses of 10.3 million and 7.2 million, respectively, and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we had unrealized gains of 5.6 million and 2.8 million, respectively, on the translation of our non-U.S. dollar denominated debt into U.S. dollars; such amounts approximate the corresponding unrealized gains and losses on the translation of our non-U.S. dollar denominated investments into U.S. dollars for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. See Note 2 for additional disclosure regarding our accounting for foreign currency. See Note 7 for additional disclosure regarding the amounts of outstanding debt denominated in each foreign currency at September 30, 2024. In the determination of the second component of the Incentive Fee, any unrealized gains/(losses) specifically related to the foreign currency denominated borrowings of non-US dollar denominated investments is offset against any associated unrealized gains/(losses) related to foreign currency denominated investments. See our Consolidated Schedule of Investments for additional disclosure regarding the foreign currency amounts (in both par and fair value) of our non-U.S. dollar denominated investments. 
 Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Our liquidity and capital resources are derived primarily from proceeds from equity issuances, advances from our credit facilities, and cash flows from operations. The primary uses of our cash and cash equivalents are: 
 investments in portfolio companies and other investments and to comply with certain portfolio diversification requirements; 

the cost of operations (including paying our Adviser); 

debt service, repayment, and other financing costs; and 

cash dividends to the holders of our shares. 

61 

We intend to continue to generate cash primarily from cash flows from operations, future borrowings and future offerings of securities. We may from time to time enter into additional debt facilities, increase the size of existing facilities or issue debt securities. Any such incurrence or issuance would be subject to prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual and regulatory restrictions and other factors. In accordance with the 1940 Act, with certain limited exceptions, we are only allowed to incur borrowings, issue debt securities or issue preferred stock if immediately after the borrowing or issuance the ratio of total assets (less total liabilities other than indebtedness) to total indebtedness plus preferred stock, is at least 150 . For more information, see Key Components of Our Results of Operations Leverage above. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, our asset coverage ratio was 184.0 and 181.6 , respectively. We carefully consider our unfunded commitments for the purpose of planning our capital resources and ongoing liquidity, including our financial leverage. Further, we maintain sufficient borrowing capacity within the 150 asset coverage limitation under the 1940 Act and the asset coverage limitation under our credit facilities to cover any outstanding unfunded commitments we are required to fund. 
 Cash and cash equivalents as of September 30, 2024, taken together with cash available under our credit facilities, is expected to be sufficient for our investing activities and to conduct our operations in the near term. As of September 30, 2024, we had approximately 1.1 billion of availability on our Revolving Credit Facility, subject to asset coverage limitations. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 29.7 million in cash and cash equivalents, including 23.2 million of restricted cash. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, cash used in operating activities was 14.8 million, primarily attributable to funding portfolio investments of 680.0 million and other operating activity of 10.6 million which was offset by an increase in net assets resulting from operations of 135.6 million and repayments and proceeds from investments of 540.3 million. Cash provided by financing activities was 19.3 million during the period, primarily attributable to borrowings of 1,107.1 million and proceeds from the issuance of common stock 93.3 million which was offset by paydowns on our Revolving Credit Facility of 1,044.2 million, dividends paid to stockholders of 128.1 million and deferred financing costs of 8.8 million. 
 Equity 
 On May 15, 2023, we issued a total of 4,500,000 shares of common stock at 17.33 per share. Net of underwriting fees and offering costs, we received total cash proceeds of 77.6 million. Subsequent to the offering we issued an additional 675,000 shares on June 12, 2023 pursuant to the overallotment option granted to underwriters and received, net of underwriting fees, total cash proceeds of 11.7 million. 
 On March 5, 2024, we issued a total of 4,000,000 shares of common stock at 20.52 per share. Net of underwriting fees and offering costs, we received total cash proceeds of 81.5 million. Subsequent to the offering, the Company issued an additional 600,000 shares on April 1, 2024 pursuant to the overallotment option granted to underwriters and received, net of offering and underwriting fees, additional total cash proceeds of 11.9 million. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we also issued 888,122 and 982,211 shares of our common stock, respectively, to investors who have not opted out of our dividend reinvestment plan for proceeds of 17.8 million and 17.8 million, respectively. 
 On August 4, 2015, our Board authorized us to acquire up to 50 million in aggregate of our common stock from time to time over an initial six month period, and has continued to authorize the refreshment of the 50 million amount authorized under and extension of the stock repurchase program prior to its expiration since that time, most recently as of May 1, 2024. The amount and timing of stock repurchases under the program may vary depending on market conditions, and no assurance can be given that any particular amount of common stock will be repurchased. 
 No shares were repurchased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 Debt 
 Revolving Credit Facility 
 In August 2012, we entered into a senior secured revolving credit agreement with Truist Bank (as a successor by merger to SunTrust Bank), as administrative agent, and J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., as syndication agent, and certain other lenders (as amended and restated, the Revolving Credit Facility ). 
 As of September 30, 2024, aggregate commitments under the facility were 1.7 billion. The facility includes an uncommitted accordion feature that allows the Company, under certain circumstances, to increase the size of the facility to up to 2.0 billion. 
 62 

Pursuant to the Fourteenth Amendment dated June 12, 2023, with respect to 1.465 billion in commitments, the revolving period, during which period we, subject to certain conditions, may make borrowings under the facility, was extended to June 11, 2027 and the stated maturity date was extended to June 12, 2028. For the remaining 220.0 million of commitments, (A) with respect to 50.0 million of commitments, the revolving period ends on February 4, 2025 and the stated maturity is February 4, 2026 and (B) with respect to 170.0 million of commitments, the revolving period ends April 24, 2026 and the stated maturity is April 23, 2027. 
 Pursuant to the Fifteenth Amendment dated April 24, 2024, aggregate commitments were increased to 1.7 billion. With respect to 1.505 billion of commitments, the revolving period was extended to April 24, 2028 and the stated maturity was extended to April 24, 2029. For the remaining 195.0 million of commitments, (A) with respect to 25.0 million of commitments, the revolving period ends on February 4, 2025 and the stated maturity is February 4, 2026 and (B) with respect to 170.0 million of commitments, the revolving period ends April 24, 2026 and the stated maturity is April 23, 2027. 
 We may borrow amounts in U.S. dollars or certain other permitted currencies. As of September 30, 2024, we had outstanding debt denominated in Australian dollars (AUD) of 64.9 million, British pounds (GBP) of 43.5 million, Canadian dollars (CAD) of 5.0 million, Swedish Krona (SEK) of 78.8 million and Euro (EUR) of 149.2 million on its Revolving Credit Facility, included in the Outstanding Principal amount in the table below. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had outstanding debt denominated in Australian dollars (AUD) of 66.4 million, British pounds (GBP) of 32.3 million, Canadian dollars (CAD) of 96.8 million, and Euro (EUR) of 57.2 million on our Revolving Credit Facility, included in the Outstanding Principal amount in the table below. 
 The Revolving Credit Facility also provides for the issuance of letters of credit up to an aggregate amount of 75.0 million. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 the Company had 3.0 million and 0.2 million, respectively, letters of credit issued through the Revolving Credit Facility. The amount available for borrowing under the Revolving Credit Facility is reduced by any letters of credit issued through the Revolving Credit Facility. 
 Amounts drawn under the Revolving Credit Facility, including amounts drawn in respect of letters of credit, bear interest at either the applicable reference rate plus an applicable credit spread adjustment, plus a margin of either 1.75 or 1.875 , or the base rate plus a margin of either 0.75 or 0.875 , in each case, based on the total amount of the borrowing base relative to the sum of the total commitments (or, if greater, the total exposure) under the Revolving Credit Facility plus certain other designated secured debt. We may elect either the applicable reference rate or base rate at the time of drawdown, and loans may be converted from one rate to another at any time, subject to certain conditions. We also pay a fee of 0.375 on undrawn amounts and, in respect of each undrawn letter of credit, a fee and interest rate equal to the then applicable margin while the letter of credit is outstanding. 
 The Revolving Credit Facility is guaranteed by Sixth Street SL SPV, LLC, TC Lending, LLC and Sixth Street SL Holding, LLC. The Revolving Credit Facility is secured by a perfected first-priority security interest in substantially all the portfolio investments held by us and each guarantor. Proceeds from borrowings may be used for general corporate purposes, including the funding of portfolio investments. 
 The Revolving Credit Facility includes customary events of default, as well as customary covenants, including restrictions on certain distributions and financial covenants. In accordance with the terms of the Fifteenth Amendment, the financial covenants require: 
 an asset coverage ratio of no less than 1.5 to 1 on the last day of any fiscal quarter; 

stockholders equity of at least 650 million plus 25 of the net proceeds of the sale of equity interests after April 24, 2024; and 

minimum asset coverage ratio of no less than 2 to 1 with respect to (i) the consolidated assets of the Company and the subsidiary guarantors (including certain limitations on the contribution of equity in financing subsidiaries) to (ii) the secured debt of the Company and its subsidiary guarantors plus unsecured senior securities of the Company and its subsidiary guarantors that mature within 90 days of the date of determination (the Obligor Asset Coverage Ratio ). 

The Revolving Credit Facility also contains certain additional concentration limits in connection with the calculation of the borrowing base, based on the Obligor Asset Coverage Ratio. 
 Net proceeds received from the Company s common stock issuances in February 2024 and April 2024 and net proceeds received from the issuance of the 2029 Notes were used to pay down borrowings on the Revolving Credit Facility. 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company was in compliance with the terms of the Revolving Credit Facility. 
 63 

million aggregate principal amount of unsecured notes that matured on January 22, 2023 (the ). Total proceeds from the issuance of the 2023 Notes, net of underwriting discounts and offering costs, were 146.9 million. The Company used the net proceeds of the 2023 Notes to repay outstanding indebtedness under the Revolving Credit Facility. The 2023 Notes matured on January 22, 2023 and were fully repaid in cash. The swap transaction associated with the issuance of the 2023 Notes also matured on January 22, 2023. 2024 Notes In November 2019, the Company issued million aggregate principal amount of unsecured notes that matured on November 1, 2024 (the ). Total proceeds from the issuance of the 2024 Notes, net of underwriting discounts, offering costs and original issue discount were 292.9 million. The Company used the net proceeds of the 2024 Notes to repay outstanding indebtedness under the Revolving Credit Facility. On February 5, 2020, the Company issued an additional million aggregate principal amount of unsecured notes that mature on November 1, 2024. The additional 2024 Notes are a further issuance of, fungible with, rank equally in right of payment with and have the same terms (other than the issue date and the public offering price) as the initial issuance of 2024 Notes. Total proceeds from the issuance of the additional 2024 Notes, net of underwriting discounts, offering costs and original issue premium were 50.1 million. The Company used the net proceeds of the 2024 Notes to repay outstanding indebtedness under the Revolving Credit Facility. In connection with the 2024 Notes offering and the reopening of the 2024 Notes, the Company entered into interest rate swaps to align the interest rates of its liabilities with the Company s investment portfolio, which consists of predominately floating rate loans. The notional amount of the two interest rates swaps is 300.0 million and 50.0 million, respectively, each of which matures on November 1, 2024, matching the maturity date of the 2024 Notes. As a result of the swaps, the Company s effective interest rate on the 2024 Notes is SOFR plus 2.54 (on a weighted average basis). The interest expense related to the 2024 Notes is offset by proceeds received from the interest rate swaps designated as a hedge. The swap adjusted interest expense is included as a component of interest expense on the Company s Consolidated Statements of Operations. As of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, the effective hedge interest rate swaps had a fair value of (1.3) million and (10.4) million, respectively, which is offset within interest expense by an equal, but opposite, fair value change for the hedged risk on the 2024 Notes. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company repurchased on the open market and extinguished 2.5 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2024 Notes for 2.4 million. In connection with the repurchase of the 2024 Notes, the Company entered into a floating-to-fixed interest rate swap with a notional amount equal to the amount of 2024 Notes repurchased, which had the effect of reducing the notional exposure of the fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps, which were entered into in connection with the issuance of the 2024 Notes, to match the remaining principal amount of the 2024 Notes outstanding. As a result of the swap, the Company s effective interest rate on the outstanding 2024 Notes is SOFR plus 2.54 (on a weighted average basis). 2026 Notes On February 3, 2021, the Company issued million aggregate principal amount of unsecured notes that mature on August 1, 2026 (the ). Total proceeds from the issuance of the 2026 Notes, net of underwriting discounts, offering costs and original issue discount, were 293.7 million. The Company used the net proceeds of the 2026 Notes to repay outstanding indebtedness under the Revolving Credit Facility. In connection with the issuance of the 2026 Notes, the Company entered into an interest rate swap to align the interest rates of its liabilities with the Company s investment portfolio, which consists of predominately floating rate loans. The notional amount of the interest rate swap is 300.0 million, which matures on August 1, 2026, matching the maturity date of the 2026 Notes. As a result of the swap, the Company s effective interest rate on the 2026 Notes is SOFR plus 2.17 . The interest expense related to the 2026 Notes is offset by proceeds received from the interest rate swaps designated as a hedge. The swap adjusted interest expense is included as a component of interest expense on the Company s Consolidated Statements of Operations. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the effective hedge interest rate swaps had a fair value of (17.2) million and (26.1) million, respectively, which is offset within interest expense by an equal, but opposite, fair value change for the hedged risk on the 2026 Notes. 

 64 

million aggregate principal amount of unsecured notes that mature on August 14, 2028 (the ). Total proceeds from the issuance of the 2028 Notes, net of underwriting discounts, offering costs and original issue discount, were 293.9 million. The Company used the net proceeds of the 2028 Notes to repay outstanding indebtedness under the Revolving Credit Facility. In connection with the issuance of the 2028 Notes, the Company entered into an interest rate swap to align the interest rates of its liabilities with the Company s investment portfolio, which consists of predominately floating rate loans. The notional amount of the interest rate swap is 300.0 million, which matures on August 14, 2028, matching the maturity date of the 2028 Notes. As a result of the swap, the Company s effective interest rate on the 2028 Notes is SOFR plus 2.99 . The interest expense related to the 2028 Notes is offset by proceeds received from the interest rate swaps designated as a hedge. The swap adjusted interest expense is included as a component of interest expense on the Company s Consolidated Statements of Operations. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the effective hedge interest rate swaps had a fair value of 6.7 million and 4.7 million, respectively, which is offset within interest expense by an equal, but opposite, fair value change for the hedged risk on the 2028 Notes. 2029 Note s On January 8, 2024, the Company issued million aggregate principal amount of unsecured notes that mature on March 1, 2029 (the ). Total proceeds from the issuance of the 2029 Notes, net of underwriting discounts, offering costs and original issue discount, were 341.6 million. The Company used the net proceeds of the 2029 Notes to repay outstanding indebtedness under the Revolving Credit Facility. In connection with the issuance of the 2029 Notes, the Company entered into an interest rate swap to align the interest rates of its liabilities with the Company s investment portfolio, which consists of predominately floating rate loans. The notional amount of the interest rate swap is 350.0 million, which matures on March 1, 2029, matching the maturity date of the 2029 Notes. As a result of the swap, the Company s effective interest rate on the 2029 Notes is SOFR plus 2.44 . The interest expense related to the 2029 Notes is offset by proceeds received from the interest rate swaps designated as a hedge. The swap adjusted interest expense is included as a component of interest expense on the Company s Consolidated Statements of Operations. As of September 30, 2024, the effective hedge interest rate swaps had a fair value of 5.4 million which is offset within interest expense by an equal, but opposite, fair value change for the hedged risk on the 2029 Notes. Debt obligations consisted of the following as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023:

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 Portfolio Company Commitments 
 From time to time, we may enter into commitments to fund investments. We incorporate these commitments into our assessment of our liquidity position. Our senior secured revolving loan commitments are generally available on a borrower s demand and may remain outstanding until the maturity date of the applicable loan. Our senior secured delayed draw term loan commitments are generally available on a borrower s demand and, once drawn, generally have the same remaining term as the associated loan agreement. Undrawn senior secured delayed draw term loan commitments generally have a shorter availability period than the term of the associated loan agreement. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had the following commitments to fund investments in current portfolio companies:

Total Portfolio Company Commitments (1)(2) 

351.3 

316.1 

(1) Represents the full amount of our commitments to fund investments on such date. Commitments may be subject to limitations on borrowings set forth in the agreements between us and the applicable portfolio company. As a result, portfolio companies may not be eligible to borrow the full commitment amount on such date. 

(2) Our estimate of the fair value of the current investments in these portfolio companies includes an analysis of the fair value of any unfunded commitments. 

Other Commitments and Contingencies 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had an unfunded commitment of 5.0 million to a new borrower that is not a current portfolio company. As of December 31, 2023, we did not have any unfunded commitments to fund investments to new borrowers that were not current portfolio companies as of such date. 
 From time to time, we may become a party to certain legal proceedings incidental to the normal course of our business. As of September 30, 2024, management is not aware of any material pending or threatened litigation that would require accounting recognition or financial statement disclosure. 
 We have certain contracts under which we have material future commitments. Under the Investment Advisory Agreement, our Adviser provides us with investment advisory and management services. For these services, we pay the Management Fee and the Incentive Fee. 
 Under the Administration Agreement, our Adviser furnishes us with office facilities and equipment, provides us clerical, bookkeeping and record keeping services at such facilities and provides us with other administrative services necessary to conduct our day-to-day operations. We reimburse our Adviser for the allocable portion (subject to the review and approval of our Board) of expenses incurred by it in performing its obligations under the Administration Agreement, the fees and expenses associated with performing compliance functions and our allocable portion of the compensation of our Chief Compliance Officer, Chief Financial Officer and other professionals who spend time on those related activities (based on a percentage of time those individuals devote, on an estimated basis, to our business and affairs). Our Adviser also offers on our behalf significant managerial assistance to those portfolio companies to which we are required to offer to provide such assistance.

In addition to the contractual payment obligations in the tables above, we also have commitments to fund investments and to pledge assets as collateral under the terms of our derivatives agreements. 
 Distributions 
 We have elected and qualified to be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a RIC under subchapter M of the Code. To maintain our RIC status, we must distribute (or be treated as distributing) in each taxable year dividends for tax purposes equal to at least 90 percent of the sum of our: 
 investment company taxable income (which is generally our ordinary income plus the excess of realized net short-term capital gains over realized net long-term capital losses), determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid, for such taxable year; and 

net tax-exempt interest income (which is the excess of our gross tax exempt interest income over certain disallowed deductions) for such taxable year. 

As a RIC, we (but not our stockholders) generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on investment company taxable income and net capital gains that we distribute to our stockholders. 
 We intend to distribute annually all or substantially all of such income. To the extent that we retain our net capital gains or any investment company taxable income, we generally will be subject to corporate-level U.S. federal income tax. We may choose to retain our net capital gains or any investment company taxable income, and pay the U.S. federal excise tax described below. 
 Amounts not distributed on a timely basis in accordance with a calendar year distribution requirement are subject to a nondeductible 4 U.S. federal excise tax payable by us. To avoid this tax, we must distribute (or be treated as distributing) during each calendar year an amount at least equal to the sum of: 
 98 of our net ordinary income excluding certain ordinary gains or losses for that calendar year; 

98.2 of our capital gain net income, adjusted for certain ordinary gains and losses, recognized for the twelve-month period ending on October 31 of that calendar year; and 

100 of any income or gains recognized, but not distributed, in preceding years. 

While we intend to distribute any income and capital gains in the manner necessary to minimize imposition of the 4 U.S. federal excise tax, sufficient amounts of our taxable income and capital gains may not be distributed to avoid entirely the imposition of this tax. In that event, we will be liable for this tax only on the amount by which we do not meet the foregoing distribution requirement. 
 We intend to pay quarterly dividends to our stockholders out of assets legally available for distribution. All dividends will be paid at the discretion of our Board and will depend on our earnings, financial condition, maintenance of our RIC status, compliance with applicable BDC regulations and such other factors as our Board may deem relevant from time to time. 
 To the extent our current taxable earnings for a year fall below the total amount of our distributions for that year, a portion of those distributions may be deemed a return of capital to our stockholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Thus, the source of a distribution to our stockholders may be the original capital invested by the stockholder rather than our income or gains. Stockholders should read any written disclosure carefully and should not assume that the source of any distribution is our ordinary income or gains. 
 69 

We have adopted an opt out dividend reinvestment plan for our common stockholders. As a result, if we declare a cash dividend or other distribution, each stockholder that has not opted out of our dividend reinvestment plan will have their dividends or distributions automatically reinvested in additional shares of our common stock rather than receiving cash dividends. Stockholders who receive distributions in the form of shares of common stock will be subject to the same U.S. federal, state and local tax consequences as if they received cash distributions. 
 Related-Party Transactions 
 We have entered into a number of business relationships with affiliated or related parties, including the following: 
 the Investment Advisory Agreement; 

the Administration Agreement; and 

an ongoing agreement with an affiliate of TPG Global, LLC governing, inter alia, the parties respective ownership of and rights to use the Sixth Street and TPG trademarks and certain variations thereof. 

Critical Accounting Estimates 
 Our critical accounting policies and estimates, including those relating to the valuation of our investment portfolio, are described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on February 15, 2024, and elsewhere in our filings with the SEC. The critical accounting policies and estimates should be read in connection with our risk factors discussed in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. 
 ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATI VE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 We are subject to financial market risks, including valuation risk, interest rate risk and currency risk. 
 Valuation Risk 
 We have invested, and plan to continue to invest, primarily in illiquid debt and equity securities of private companies. Most of our investments will not have a readily available market price, and we value these investments at fair value as determined in good faith by our Board in accordance with our valuation policy. There is no single standard for determining fair value. As a result, determining fair value requires that judgment be applied to the specific facts and circumstances of each portfolio investment while employing a consistently applied valuation process for the types of investments we make. If we were required to liquidate a portfolio investment in a forced or liquidation sale, we may realize amounts that are different from the amounts presented and such differences could be material. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 Interest rate sensitivity refers to the change in earnings that may result from changes in the level of interest rates. We also fund portions of our investments with borrowings. Our net investment income is affected by the difference between the rate at which we invest and the rate at which we borrow. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that a significant change in market interest rates will not have a material adverse effect on our net investment income. 
 We regularly measure our exposure to interest rate risk. We assess interest rate risk and manage our interest rate exposure on an ongoing basis by comparing our interest rate-sensitive assets to our interest rate-sensitive liabilities. Based on that review, we determine whether or not any hedging transactions are necessary to mitigate exposure to changes in interest rates. 
 As of September 30, 2024, 98.8 of our debt investments based on fair value in our portfolio bore interest at floating rates, with 100.0 of these subject to interest rate floors. Our credit facilities also bear interest at floating rates, and in connection with our 2024 Notes, 2026 Notes, 2028 Notes and 2029 Notes, which bear interest at fixed rates, we entered into fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps in order to align the interest rates of our liabilities with our investment portfolio. 
 70 

Assuming that our consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2024 were to remain constant and that we took no actions to alter our existing interest rate sensitivity, the following table shows the annualized impact of hypothetical base rate changes in interest rates (considering interest rate floors for floating rate instruments): 

in millions)

Although we believe that this analysis is indicative of our existing sensitivity to interest rate changes, it does not adjust for changes in the credit market, credit quality, the size and composition of the assets in our portfolio and other business developments that could affect our net income. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that actual results would not differ materially from the analysis above. 
 We may in the future hedge against interest rate fluctuations by using hedging instruments such as additional interest rate swaps, futures, options and forward contracts. While hedging activities may mitigate our exposure to adverse fluctuations in interest rates, certain hedging transactions that we may enter into in the future, such as interest rate swap agreements, may also limit our ability to participate in the benefits of changes in interest rates with respect to our portfolio investments. 
 Currency Risk 
 From time to time, we may make investments that are denominated in a foreign currency. These investments are translated into U.S. dollars at each balance sheet date, exposing us to movements in foreign exchange rates. We may employ hedging techniques to minimize these risks, but we cannot assure you that such strategies will be effective or without risk to us. We may seek to utilize instruments such as, but not limited to, forward contracts to seek to hedge against fluctuations in the relative values of our portfolio positions from changes in currency exchange rates. We also have the ability to borrow in certain foreign currencies under our Revolving Credit Facility. Instead of entering into a foreign exchange forward contract in connection with loans or other investments we have made that are denominated in a foreign currency, we may borrow in that currency to establish a natural hedge against our loan or investment. To the extent the loan or investment is based on a floating rate other than a rate under which we can borrow under our Revolving Credit Facility, we may seek to utilize interest rate derivatives to hedge our exposure to changes in the associated rate. 
 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures. As of the end of the period covered by this report, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )). Any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our current disclosure controls and procedures are effective in timely alerting them to material information relating to us that is required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting. There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during our most recently completed fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 71 

PART II OTHE R INFORMATION 
 ITEM 1. Legal Proceedings.
