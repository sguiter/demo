and , respectively, and incurred net losses of and , respectively. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had an accumulated deficit of and negative working capital of . Based on the Company s liquidity position at September 30, 2024 after giving effect to the impact of the Divestiture and the repayment of a portion of our term loan, and the Company s current forecast of operating results and cash flows, absent any other action, management determined that there is substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern over the twelve months following the filing of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, principally driven by the Company s current debt service obligations, historical negative cash flows and recurring losses. The Company will require additional liquidity to continue its operations over the next twelve months. On the Divestiture Closing Date, the Company completed the sale of Veritone One for total consideration up to , subject to purchase price adjustments and the achievement of certain earnout targets as described below. Net proceeds from the transaction were in cash, which reflected the aggregate purchase price of , less subject to an earnout described below, of purchase price adjustments, and placed in escrow accounts described below. The Company may receive the earnout of up to in cash proceeds based on the achievement of certain net revenue targets by Veritone One between January 1, 2025 and December 31, 2025 (the Earnout ). Of the amounts placed in escrow, was placed in an escrow account for potential purchase price adjustments and an aggregate of was placed in escrow accounts for the potential satisfaction of post-closing indemnification claims, in each case subject to the terms and limitations set forth in the Purchase Agreement. Net cash proceeds from the Divestiture were used to repay principal amount of the Company s outstanding Term Loan (defined in Note 4), plus accrued interest and a prepayment premium in an aggregate amount of , and to pay in deal-related expenses. Immediately following the Divestiture and the repayment of a portion of its Term Loan, the Company reported cash on hand of , and the Company improved its negative working capital as compared to September 30, 2024. Potential future consideration from the Divestiture in the form of cash held in escrow and the Earnout is up to . is expected to be settled and may be released within 90 to 120 days after the Divestiture Closing Date, is expected to settle and may be released 12 months after the Divestiture Closing Date, and is expected to settle and may be released 24 months after the Divestiture Closing Date. While management believes a large portion of this potential future consideration will be earned and paid back to the Company over the next , both the escrowed amounts and Earnout are subject to future negotiation and financial performance of Veritone One, a portion of which the Company will have no direct control over. As a result, there is no guarantee that any of the deferred consideration will be earned and or paid back to the Company. Given the Company s forecast over the next twelve months, the Company will require additional liquidity to continue its operations over the next twelve months. In the near term, and to meet its obligations as they come due, the Company is evaluating additional strategies to obtain funding for future operations. These strategies may include, but are not limited to, obtaining equity financing, debt and/or further restructuring of operations to grow revenues and decrease operating expenses, which include capturing past cost reductions and potential future cost synergies from the Company s past acquisitions. The going concern assumption contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business, including having sufficient liquidity in the future to meet, amongst other things, its covenants under the Term Loan Credit Agreement (as defined in Note 4). The Company may not be able to access additional equity under acceptable terms, and may not be successful in future operational restructurings, earning any of its deferred purchase consideration, meeting its minimum liquidity threshold under its Credit Agreement or growing its revenue base. If the Company becomes unable to continue as a going concern, it may have to dispose of other or additional assets and might realize significantly less value than the values at which they are carried on its condensed consolidated financial statements. These actions may cause the Company s stockholders to lose all or part of their investment in the Company s common stock. The condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the Company being unable to continue as a going concern. If the Company cannot continue as a going concern, adjustments to the carrying values and classification of its assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of income and expenses could be required and could be material.

Due to the nature of transactions between Veritone One and our representation services, certain intercompany transactions that are planned to continue and were not settled at the closing date were reinstated in the corresponding financial periods, including certain accounts receivable from continuing operations and accrued media from discontinued operations, which were collectively at September 30, 2024 and at December 31, 2023.

This method is based on the application of a royalty rate to forecasted revenue that is expected to be generated by the existing developed technology. The economic useful life was determined based on the technology cycle related to the developed technology, as well as the timing of cash flows over the forecast period. Customer relationships relate to the sales of products and services to Broadbean s existing customer base. The Company valued the customer relationships using the multi-period excess earnings method under the income approach. This method reflects the present value of the projected cash flows that are expected to be generated by the existing customer relationships less charges representing the contribution of other assets to those cash flows. The economic useful life was determined based on historical customer turnover rates, as well as the timing of cash flows over the forecast period.

Convertible Notes In November 2021, the Company issued, at par value, aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes due 2026 (the Convertible Notes ). The issuance included the full exercise of an option granted by the Company to the initial purchasers of the Convertible Notes to purchase an additional aggregate principal amount of Convertible Notes. The Convertible Notes were issued pursuant to and are subject to the terms and conditions of an indenture, which is referred to as the Indenture, between the Company and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee. The Convertible Notes were offered and sold in a private offering to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.

Holders of the Convertible Notes may convert all or any portion of their Convertible Notes at their option at any time prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding May 15, 2026, only under the following conditions: (1) during any calendar quarter commencing after the calendar quarter ending on March 31, 2022 (and only during such calendar quarter), if the last reported sale price of the Company s common stock for at least trading days (whether or not consecutive) during a period of consecutive trading days ending on, and including, the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter is greater than or equal to of the conversion price on each applicable trading day; (2) during the five business day period after any five consecutive trading day period (the measurement period in which the trading price per principal amount of Convertible Notes for each trading day of the measurement period was less than of the product of the last reported sale price of the Company s common stock and the conversion rate for the Convertible Notes on each such trading day; (3) if the Company calls such Convertible Notes for redemption, at any time prior to the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the applicable redemption date; or (4) upon the occurrence of specified corporate events. On or after , holders may convert all or any portion of their Convertible Notes at any time prior to the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date regardless of the foregoing conditions. Upon conversion, the Company will pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, shares of its common stock or a combination of cash and shares of its common stock, at the Company s election. The conversion rate for the Convertible Notes initially is shares of the Company s common stock per 1,000 principal amount of Convertible Notes (equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately per share of common stock). The conversion rate is subject to adjustment in some events but will not be adjusted for any accrued and unpaid interest. In addition, following certain corporate events that occur prior to the maturity date or following the Company s issuance of a notice of redemption, the Company will, in certain circumstances, increase the conversion rate for a holder who elects to convert its Convertible Notes in connection with such a corporate event or who elects to convert its Convertible Notes called (or deemed called) for redemption during the related redemption period, as the case may be.

, after deducting debt issuance costs. The total debt issuance costs incurred and recorded by the Company amounted to , which were recorded as a reduction to the face amount of the Convertible Notes and are being amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method over the contractual term of the Convertible Notes. The Convertible Notes are recorded as a liability within convertible senior notes, non-current. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , interest expense related to the Convertible Notes, including amortization of issuance costs, was and , respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, interest expense related to the Convertible Notes, including amortization of issuance costs, was and , respectively. The effective annual interest rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was approximately . As of September 30, 2024 , the if-converted value of the Convertible Notes did t exceed the outstanding principal amount. As of September 30, 2024 , the total estimated fair value of the Convertible Notes was , which was determined based on a market approach using actual bids and offers of the Convertible Notes in an over-the-counter market during the period. The Company considers these assumptions to be Level 2 inputs in accordance with the fair value hierarchy described in Note 6. Capped Calls In connection with the 2022 pricing of the Convertible Notes, with the full exercise by the initial purchasers of their option to purchase additional Convertible Notes in November 2021, the Company used approximately of the net proceeds from the issuance of the Convertible Notes to enter into privately negotiated capped call transactions, which are referred to as the capped calls, with various financial institutions. The capped call transactions cover, subject to anti-dilution adjustments substantially similar to those applicable to the Convertible Notes, the number of shares of the Company s common stock underlying the Convertible Notes. The capped call transactions are expected generally to reduce the potential dilution to the Company s common stock upon conversion of the Convertible Notes and/or offset some or all of any cash payments the Company is required to make in excess of the principal amount of converted Convertible Notes, as the case may be, in the event that the market price per share of the Company s common stock, as measured under the terms of the capped call transactions, is greater than the strike price of the capped call transactions, which initially corresponds to the conversion price of the Convertible Notes and is subject to anti-dilution adjustments substantially similar to those applicable to the conversion rate of the Convertible Notes. If, however, the market price per share of the Company s common stock, as measured under the terms of the capped call transactions, exceeds the cap price of the capped call transactions, there would nevertheless be dilution and/or there would not be an offset of such potential cash payments, in each case, to the extent that such market price exceeds the cap price of the capped call transactions. The initial cap price of the capped calls is per share of common stock, which represents a premium of over the last reported sale price of the Company s common stock of per share on November 16, 2021, and is subject to certain customary adjustments under the terms of the capped calls; provided that the cap price will not be reduced to an amount less than the strike price of per share. The capped call transactions are separate transactions and are not part of the terms of the Convertible Notes. The capped calls met the criteria for classification as equity and, as such, are not remeasured each reporting period and are included as a reduction to additional paid-in-capital within stockholders equity. In connection with the 2022 Repurchase Transaction, the Company entered into transactions to unwind a portion of the capped calls. As a result, the Company received in net proceeds from the proceeds of the unwinding of the capped calls. In connection with the 2023 Repurchase Transaction, the Company entered into transactions to unwind a portion of the capped calls. The Company did t receive any proceeds from the unwinding of the capped calls in 2023. Credit Facility In August 2023, the Company entered into a credit agreement with Alterna Capital Solutions, LLC ACS pursuant to which the Company might have borrowed up to (the ACS Credit Facility ). Loans under the ACS Credit Facility were secured by certain or , and minimum annual interest of if no funds are drawn under the ACS Credit Facility in a given year. ACS was a senior secured creditor.

The total purchase consideration for PandoLogic included up to in contingent consideration based on achieving certain contingent consideration tied to financial performance of PandoLogic in fiscal 2021 and 2022, which amounts were payable in a combination of cash and common stock (the PandoLogic Contingent Consideration ). At December 31, 2023, all Pandologic Contingent Consideration had been paid. All of the Company s contingent consideration liabilities are categorized as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy, except when the amount of the payout is determined to be fixed. Contingent consideration for the PandoLogic acquisition was valued at the time of acquisition using Monte Carlo simulation models. These models incorporate contractual terms and assumptions regarding financial forecasts for PandoLogic, discount rates, and volatility of forecasted revenue. The value of the Company s contingent consideration would increase if a lower discount rate was used and would decrease if a higher discount rate was used. Similarly, a higher revenue volatility assumption would increase the value of the contingent consideration, and a lower revenue volatility assumption would decrease the value of the contingent consideration. Contingent consideration for the March 2022 Acquisition (as defined below) was valued at the time of acquisition using a simple probability of achievement model, with the probability of achievement based on management s forecasted outcomes for 2022 and 2023 fiscal year results for the acquired entity. The development and determination of the unobservable inputs for Level 3 fair value measurements and fair value calculations are the responsibility of the Company s management with the assistance of a third-party valuation specialist when deemed necessary. In September 2022, the Company and PandoLogic s former owners entered into an amendment to the PandoLogic Merger Agreement. This amendment provides that the PandoLogic Contingent Consideration would be no less than , irrespective of the actual financial performance of PandoLogic for the PandoLogic Contingent Consideration period. All of the PandoLogic Contingent Consideration was paid during the year ended December 31, 2023 in a combination of cash consideration and stock consideration, with the number of shares paid equal to that stock consideration portion of the contingent consideration amount divided by a price per share of in accordance with the terms of the PandoLogic Merger Agreement. On , the Company acquired of an influencer-based management company (the March 2022 Acquisition ). As part of the consideration, the seller was eligible to receive up to in cash (the March 2022 Acquisition Consideration ). In July 2023, the Company entered into an agreement amending the March 2022 Acquisition Consideration (the March 2022 Acquisition Amendment ). The March 2022 Acquisition Amendment provides that the March 2022 Acquisition Consideration was reduced to and payment of the March 2022 Acquisition Consideration amount is now tied to employment status of the seller through December 31, 2025, irrespective of the actual financial performance of the acquired company, the remainder of which is to be paid ratably over the service period. As the amount became fixed under the March 2022 Acquisition Amendment, the Company determined that the March 2022 Acquisition Consideration amount should no longer be categorized as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy at the time of the amendment.

As of September 30, 2024 , the Warrant Holders held warrants to purchase shares of Common Stock. All of the Company s outstanding stock warrants are categorized as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy. Stock warrants are equity classified and have been recorded at their fair value, on their issuance date of December 13, 2023, using either a probability weighted expected return model, the Monte Carlo simulation model or the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. These models incorporate contractual terms, maturity, risk-free interest rates and volatility. The value of the Company s stock warrants would increase if a higher risk-free interest rate was used and would decrease if a lower risk-free interest rate was used. Similarly, a higher volatility assumption would increase the value of the stock warrants, and a lower volatility assumption would decrease the value of the stock warrants. The development and determination of the unobservable inputs for Level 3 fair value measurements and fair value calculations are the responsibility of the Company s management with the assistance of a third-party valuation specialist.

Provision for Income Taxes In accordance with ASC 740-270, Income Taxes , the provision or benefit from income taxes for interim periods is determined using an estimate of the Company s annual effective tax rate, adjusted for discrete items, if any, that are taken into account in the relevant period. Each quarter, the Company updates the estimate of the annual effective tax rate, and if the estimated tax rate changes, the Company records a cumulative adjustment. A separate estimated annual effective tax rate is applied for jurisdictions where an entity anticipates an ordinary loss or has an ordinary loss for the year to date for which no tax benefit can be recognized. The Company s effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was and , respectively. The difference between the effective tax rate and the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21 is primarily due to a valuation allowance established on the Company s domestic federal and state net deferred tax assets, as well as the impact of foreign operations subject to tax in foreign jurisdictions. The Company s effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 was 3 and , respectively. The change in the effective tax rates for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the comparable prior year periods is primarily due to the impact of taxes on foreign operations and valuation allowances against domestic net deferred tax assets. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, t he Company had net deferred tax liabilities of and , respectively, which is included in other non-current liabilities in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. As of September 30, 2024, the Company continues to provide a valuation allowance against federal and state deferred tax assets that are not expected to be realizable. The Company continues to evaluate the realizability of deferred tax assets and the related valuation allowance. If the Company s assessment of the deferred tax assets or the corresponding valuation allowance were to change, the Company would record the related adjustment to income during the period in which the determination is made. As a result of the Broadbean acquisition, the Company expects to be subject to taxation in France and Australia, in addition to already being subject to taxation in the United States, Israel, and the United Kingdom. The United States, Israel, and the United Kingdom comprise the majority of the Company s operations. In general, the U.S. federal statute of limitations is three years. However, the Internal Revenue Service may still adjust a tax loss or credit carryover in the year the tax loss or credit carryover is utilized. As such, the Company s U.S. federal tax returns and state tax returns are open for examination since inception. The Israeli statute of limitations period is generally four years commencing at the end of the year in which the return was filed. The UK statute of limitations period is typically twelve months following the date on which the return is filed. The Company s 2022 U.S. federal tax return for Pandologic, Inc. is currently under examination. There are no other ongoing examinations from income tax authorities in the jurisdictions in which the Company does business.

This discussion contains forward-looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those discussed under Risk Factors, set forth in Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, Risk Factors, set forth in Part I, Item 1A of our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, and any updates thereto set forth in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC ), including future SEC filings. See Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements. 
 Overview 
 Veritone, Inc., collectively with our subsidiaries, referred to as Veritone, Company, we, our, and us, is a provider of Artificial Intelligence AI solutions, powered by our proprietary AI operating system, aiWARE , to deliver differentiated products and solutions to our Commercial Enterprise and Public Sector (which we previously referred to as Government Regulated Industries) customers. Our Software Products Services consist of revenues generated from Commercial Enterprise and Public Sector customers using our aiWARE platform and Veritone Hire solutions, any related support and maintenance services, and any related professional services associated with the deployment and/or implementation of such solutions. Our Managed Services consist of revenues generated from Commercial Enterprise customers using our content licensing and representation services, including influencer management and related operations. 
 Through October 17, 2024, we operated a full-service advertising agency through a wholly-owned subsidiary, Veritone One (as defined below), that provided Managed Services to its customers. On October 17, 2024, we sold all of the issued and outstanding equity of Veritone One, LLC (formerly, Veritone One, Inc., referred herein collectively as Veritone One to an affiliate of Insignia Capital Group L.P., pursuant to which, among other things, Purchaser acquired from the Company all of the issued and outstanding equity of Veritone One (such transaction, the Divestiture ). The historical financial results of Veritone One are reflected in these condensed consolidated financial statements as discontinued operations and, as such, have been excluded from continuing operations for all periods presented on a retrospective basis, unless otherwise stated. 
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we generated revenue of 22.0 million and 70.2 million, respectively, as compared to 28.0 million and 72.9 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. Our Software Products Services revenue was 14.7 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 20.4 million for the same period in 2023, while our Managed Services revenue was 7.3 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 7.6 million for the same period in 2023. Our Software Products Services revenue was 45.5 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 48.6 million for the same period in 2023, while our Managed Services revenue was 24.7 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 24.3 million for the same period in 2023. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, no customer represented more than 10 of our consolidated revenue. During the three and three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, our largest customer represented less than 10 and 12 , respectively, of our consolidated revenue. 
 Recent Developments 
 Appointment of Ryan Steelberg as Chairman. Ryan Steelberg, our Chief Executive Officer, was appointed Chairman of the Board, effective January 22, 2024, replacing Chad Steelberg who resigned as Chairman of the Board on the same date. Chad Steelberg continues to serve as a member of our Board. 
 Operational Realignment and Restructuring. During the first quarter of 2024, we enacted certain operational and restructuring initiatives (the Q1 2024 Restructuring ). As a result of the Q1 2024 Restructuring, we expect to reduce our annualized operating expenses by approximately 13.0 million. We have continued with additional cost reductions in the second half of 2024, which when combined with our Q1 2024 Restructuring, we expect will result in over 40.0 million of net annualized strategic cost reductions. We incurred 3.9 million in one-time severance and transition expenses in connection with the Q1 2024 Restructuring, all of which was paid as of September 30, 2024 and we have incurred approximately 1.4 million in related one-time severance and transition costs for our cost reduction initiatives after the Q1 2024 Restructuring of which 0.3 million was paid as of September 30, 2024. The cumulative results of these initiatives was an approximate 19 reduction in our global workforce. 
 Election of Michael Keithley as a Class I Director . On June 13, 2024, at our 2024 annual meeting of stockholders (the Annual Meeting ), Michael Keithley was elected as a Class I Director for a three-year term expiring at the Company s annual meeting of stockholders in 2027. Jeffrey P. Gehl resigned as a member of the Board of Directors immediately prior to the commencement of the Annual Meeting. 
 Divestiture of Media Agency. On October 17, 2024, we consummated the Divestiture for a total purchase price of up to 104.0 million. The Divestiture was strategic, allowing us to focus on our AI solutions, and secondarily to improve our financial liquidity with the net proceeds from the Divestiture. Net proceeds from the transaction were 59.1 million in cash, which reflected the aggregate purchase price of 104.0 
 32 

million, less 18.0 million subject to an earnout described below, 20.3 million of purchase price adjustments, and 6.7 million placed in escrow accounts. We may receive the earnout of up to 18.0 million in cash proceeds based on the achievement of certain net revenue targets by Veritone One between January 1, 2025 and December 31, 2025. On October 22, 2024, we used net cash proceeds from the Divestiture to repay 30.5 million principal amount of our outstanding Term Loan, plus accrued interest and a prepayment premium in the aggregate amount of 3.3 million, and 3.9 million in deal-related expenses. As of October 22, 2024, immediately following the repayment of a portion of our Term Loan, we reported cash on hand of 27.3 million. 
 During the third quarter of 2024, we determined that Veritone One met the criteria to be classified as discontinued operations. As a result, the historical financial results of Veritone One are reflected in our condensed consolidated financial statements herein as discontinued operations and, as such, have been excluded from continuing operations for all periods presented on a retrospective basis, unless otherwise stated. See Note 3 on Discontinued Operations for more information. 
 Opportunities, Challenges and Risks 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we derived our revenue primarily through our Commercial Enterprise customers, and secondarily, through our Public Sector customers. 
 We are a leader in AI-based Software Products Services. Our proprietary AI operating system, aiWARE, uses machine learning algorithms, or AI models, together with a suite of powerful applications, to reveal valuable insights from vast amounts of structured and unstructured data. Historically, we have derived a large portion of our Software Product Services revenue from applications we internally developed from our aiWARE platform and actively sell to various customers. While management believes there is a substantial opportunity to increase revenue longer term, current economic conditions have negatively impacted parts of our consumption-based operations and financial results, and there is no certainty that any future investments, which could be significant and include future potential acquisitions, will result in significant enterprise revenue realization or revenue growth when compared with historical revenue. Nevertheless, we continue to see significant opportunities for growth in Software Products Services and our aiWARE platform sales to existing and newly acquired customers, and where our AI solutions could add near and long-term value in the Public Sector industries and content creation and distribution across the global media and entertainment industry. 
 We believe there are significant near and long-term revenue and growth opportunities from our Software Products Services. In June 2023, we completed the acquisition of Broadbean, a leader in subscription-based talent acquisition software-as-a-service which has approximately 3,000 subscription-based customers based throughout the world, integrated with over 100 applicant tracking systems ATS and has direct access to over 2,500 job boards globally. The acquisition of Broadbean was strategic to our growth across our Veritone Hire applications, as we plan in the near term to offer our existing product offerings to Broadbean s 3,000 customers, including programmatic advertising capabilities. Over the long term, we plan to utilize our AI capabilities to analyze complex data sets through direct access to these ATS, including future integration with aiWARE. In Public Sector markets, we see significant near and long term growth opportunities with customer adoption of our aiWARE platform, including our recently announced iDEMS solution, to facilitate and improve existing and growing demand for more robust digital evidence management systems and services across the entire public safety industry, the U.S. Department of Justice and the Chief Digital and Artificial Intelligence Officer and Department of Defense. However, many enterprise-level opportunities with Public Sector customers can involve long sales cycles, during which we must invest significant time and resources without a guarantee of success. 
 Growing our existing and new Software Products Services customer base is critical for our success. Software Products Services revenue decreased by 6.2 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the prior year period due to lower consumption across our Commercial Enterprise customer base, including Amazon and certain one-time software revenue recognized in 2023 that did not recur at the same rate in 2024, partially offset by the addition of Broadbean in the second quarter of 2023. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, no customer represented more than 10 of our consolidated revenue as compared to one customer that represented 12 of our consolidated revenue during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 As a result of the recent pullback in the macroeconomic environment caused by high inflation, high interest rates, higher unemployment and geopolitical factors including the Russia-Ukraine conflict and the war in Israel, some of our customers reduced consumption-based spending across our Commercial Enterprise customer base, namely from our Veritone Hire solutions. 
 As of September 30, 2024, our total Software Products Services customers declined to 3,291, which was a decrease of 6.9 as compared to the end of the third quarter of 2023. The decrease in customers was largely driven by planned migration of legacy CareerBuilder customers off the Broadbean software platform, which did not have a significant impact on our financial results in 2023 or for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. To continue our effort to grow our customer base and overall revenue, we have been investing aggressively in existing customers and acquiring new customers. In addition, in February 2024, we announced certain cost reduction and restructuring initiatives, the results of which was a reduction in our global workforce of approximately 13 as of September 30, 2024. Since the first quarter of 2023, we have been actively realigning and restructuring our organization, which, as of September 30, 2024, is expected to result in over 40.0 million of net annualized strategic cost reductions, which includes expected cost reductions from our Q1 2024 Restructuring along with 
 33 

additional cost reductions made in the second half of 2024. As a result of our efforts to diversify our customer base and increase sales within our existing customer base, as well as the June 2023 acquisition of Broadbean, we increased our sales and marketing spending in the near term as compared to the trailing twelve months; however, these increased investments were partially offset by our 2023 and 2024 cost-reduction initiatives. 
 We believe our Software Products Services will extend the capabilities of many third-party software platforms and products that are widely used today. For example, we believe that, when integrated with aiWARE, our Veritone Hire solutions customers will be given greater visibility and transparency in their hiring processes. Further and with the recently announced iDEMs launch, we now offer a suite of aiWARE applications to address the growing issue of unstructured digital data management faced by public safety and federal government sectors today. In addition, we recently announced that we achieved Amazon Web Services AWS Advanced Tier Services status, advancing the deployment of our AI solutions and capabilities across the AWS platform, and we have historically integrated aiWARE across many platforms, including Alteryx, Snowflake and the NVIDIA CUDA GPU-based platform, enabling dramatic increases in aiWARE s processing speed and providing a wide range of new use cases for our technology. We are in the process of developing and marketing more specific use cases for these and future integrations, which we believe will open up new markets for our products and accelerate our long-term revenue growth opportunities. 
 We believe our operating results and performance are, and will continue to be, driven by various factors that affect our industry. Our ability to attract, grow and retain customers for our aiWARE platform is highly sensitive to rapidly changing technology and is dependent on our ability to maintain the attractiveness of our platform, content and services to our customers. Our future revenue and operating growth will rely heavily on our ability to grow and retain our Software Products Services customer base, continue to develop and deploy quality and innovative AI-driven applications and enterprise-level offerings, provide unique and attractive content and related services to our customers, continue to grow in newer markets such as Public Sector, expand aiWARE into larger and more expansive enterprise engagements and manage our corporate overhead costs. While we believe we will be successful in these endeavors, we cannot guarantee that we will succeed in generating substantial long term operating growth and profitability. 
 Historically, we have pursued an opportunistic strategy of acquiring companies to help accelerate our organic growth. Our acquisition strategy has been threefold: (i) to increase the scale of our business in markets we are in today, (ii) to accelerate growth in new markets and product categories, including expanding our existing engineering and sales resources, and (iii) to accelerate the adoption of aiWARE as the universal AI operating system through venture or market-driven opportunities. While we believe there are strategic acquisition targets that can accelerate our entry into and expand our existing market share in key strategic markets, as well as our ability to grow our business, there is no certainty our historical or future acquisitions will achieve these objectives. Conversely, we have pursued and may continue to pursue opportunistic sales of certain business operations that are not strategic to us long-term, such as the divestitures of our Energy Group in the second quarter of 2023 and our media agency in October 2024. 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, our total revenues were 22.0 million and 70.2 million, respectively, as compared to 28.0 million and 72.9 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, a decrease of 21.8 and 3.7 , respectively, over the prior year periods. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, our total loss from operations was 22.5 million and 67.2 million, respectively, as compared to 25.2 million and 79.8 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, an improvement of 10.7 and 15.8 , respectively, over the prior year periods. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, our non-GAAP gross margin (calculated as described in Non-GAAP Financial Measures below) was approximately 71.2 and 72.1 , respectively, as compared to 74.9 and 70.7 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, driven in large part by decreased customer margins and the mix of revenue as compared to the prior year periods. Our non-GAAP gross margin is impacted significantly by the mix of our Software Products Services and our Managed Services revenue in any given period because our Managed Services revenue typically has a lower overall non-GAAP gross margin than our Software Products Services revenue. Our non-GAAP gross profit (see Non-GAAP Financial Measures below) is also dependent upon our ability to grow our revenue by expanding our customer base and increasing business with existing customers, and to manage our costs by negotiating favorable economic terms with cloud computing providers such as AWS and Microsoft Azure. While we are focused on continuing to improve our non-GAAP gross profit, our ability to attract and retain customers to grow our revenue will be highly dependent on our ability to implement and continually improve upon our technology and services and improve our technology infrastructure and operations as we experience increased network capacity constraints due to our growth. 
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we reported a net loss from continuing operations of 22.6 million and 72.1 million, respectively, as compared to a net loss of 26.8 million and 79.8 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we reported a non-GAAP net loss from continuing operations of 11,097 and 31,139, respectively, as compared to a non-GAAP net loss of 10,411 and 36,833 during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. To continue to grow our revenue, we will continue to make targeted investments in people, namely software engineers and sales personnel. Historically, we have also made investments in our corporate infrastructure, including new ERP and workforce systems to help us better manage the scale and growth of our business. However, considering the current challenging macro-economic environment, we have made and are continuing to make significant cost reductions to our operating structure to better 
 34 

streamline our business and prioritization around our growth and corresponding investments throughout 2024 and into 2025. These cost reduction initiatives began in the latter half of 2022 and will continue through 2024 and 2025, and include reductions in workforce and certain legacy operating costs, as well as the integration of past acquisitions. As a result of these initiatives, we believe we will be able to accelerate our pathway toward long term profitability. 
 With the June 2023 acquisition of Broadbean, we expanded our customer base throughout Europe and Asia Pacific. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, 28.9 and 28.4 , respectively, of our consolidated revenue was from customers outside of the U.S., principally from customers located throughout Western Europe, as compared to 23.5 and 10.8 during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. We believe that there is a substantial opportunity for us to continue expanding our service offerings and customer base in countries outside of the United States. In the long term, we plan to expand our business further internationally in places such as Europe, Asia Pacific and Latin America, and as a result, we expect to continue to incur significant incremental upfront expenses associated with these expansion opportunities. 
 Impact of Current Global Economic Conditions 
 Global economic and business activities continue to face uncertainty as a result of macroeconomic and geopolitical factors, labor shortages, inflation rates, the U.S. presidential election and responses by central banking authorities to control inflation, monetary supply shifts, recession risks, disruptions from the Russia-Ukraine conflict, and the war in Israel. In particular, business operations at our Herzliya office location where we do development work on our Veritone Hire solutions products have been, and may continue to be, impacted by the war in Israel. A small portion of our Israel-based employees, and a number of their family members, have been conscripted into military service. The extent of the impact of these factors on our operational and financial performance, including our ability to execute our business strategies and initiatives in the expected time frame, will depend on future developments, and the impact on our customers, partners and employees, all of which have uncertainty and cannot be predicted. These global economic conditions and any continued or new disruptions caused by these conditions may negatively impact our business in a number of ways. For example, our Commercial Enterprise solutions are sold to businesses whose financial conditions fluctuate based on general economic and business conditions, particularly the overall demand for labor and the economic health of current and prospective employers. 
 To the extent that economic uncertainty or attenuated economic conditions cause our customers and potential customers to freeze or reduce their headcount, and reduce their consumption-based spending, demand for our products and services may be negatively affected. These adverse economic conditions could also result in reductions in sales of our applications, longer sales cycles, reductions in contract duration and value, slower adoption of new technologies and increased price competition. In addition, economic recessions have historically resulted in overall reductions in spending on software and technology solutions as well as pressure from customers and potential customers for extended payment terms. If economic, political, or market conditions deteriorate, or if there is uncertainty around these conditions, our customers and potential customers may elect to decrease their software and technology solutions budgets by deferring or reconsidering product purchases, which would limit our ability to grow our business and negatively affect our operating results. Any of these events would likely have an adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial position. 
 Due to the nature of our business, the effect of these macroeconomic conditions may not be fully reflected in our results of operations until future periods. We have assessed the potential credit deterioration of our customers due to changes in the macroeconomic environment and have determined that no additional allowance for credit losses was necessary due to credit deterioration as of September 30, 2024. The most significant risks to our business and results of operations are discussed in Part I, Item 1A (Risk Factors) of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, and Part II, Item 1A (Risk Factors) of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Key Performance Indicators 
 In evaluating our cash flows and financial performance, we use certain non-GAAP financial measures, including Pro Forma Software Revenue, non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP net income (loss), and non-GAAP net income (loss) per share. We also provide certain key performance indicators KPIs ), including Total Software Products Services Customers, Annual Recurring Revenue, Annual Recurring Revenue (SaaS), Annual Recurring Revenue (Consumption), Total New Bookings and Gross Revenue Retention. 
 Pro Forma information provided in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q represents our historical information combined with the historical information of Broadbean (as defined below) for the applicable period on a pro forma basis as if we had acquired Broadbean on January 1, 2022. We completed the acquisition of Broadbean on June 13, 2023, and therefore, periods commencing after June 13, 2023 are not presented on a Pro Forma basis. 
 Pro Forma Software Revenue represents Software Products Services revenue on a Pro Forma basis. Non-GAAP gross margin is defined as Non-GAAP gross profit divided by revenue. Non-GAAP gross profit is calculated as our loss from operations with adjustments to add back sales and marketing expense, research and development expense, general and administrative expense and amortization expense. Non-GAAP net loss (pro forma) is the Company s net loss excluding the items set forth below. Non-GAAP net income (loss) and non-GAAP net income (loss) per share is the Company s net income (loss) and net income (loss) per share, adjusted to exclude provision for income taxes, 
 35 

depreciation expense, amortization expense, stock-based compensation expense, changes in fair value of contingent consideration, interest income, interest expense, foreign currency gains and losses, gain on debt extinguishment, acquisition and due diligence costs, gain or loss on sale of investment assets, loss from business held for sale, variable consultant performance bonus expense, severance and executive transition costs and net income from discontinued operations. The results for non-GAAP net income (loss), are presented below for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The items excluded from these non-GAAP financial measures, as well as a breakdown of GAAP net loss, non-GAAP net income (loss) and these excluded items between our Core Operations and Corporate, are detailed in the reconciliation below. In addition, we have provided supplemental non-GAAP measures of gross profit, operating expenses, loss from operations, other (expense) income, net, and loss before income taxes, excluding the items excluded from non-GAAP net loss as noted above, and reconciling such non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures. 
 We present these non-GAAP financial measures because management believes such information to be important supplemental measures of performance that are commonly used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies in our industry. Management also uses this information internally for forecasting and budgeting. These non-GAAP financial measures are not calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss), operating income (loss) or any other financial measures so calculated and presented, nor as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities as a measure of liquidity. Other companies (including our competitors) may define these non-GAAP financial measures differently. These non-GAAP measures may not be indicative of our historical operating results or predictive of potential future results. Investors should not consider this supplemental non-GAAP financial information in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported in accordance with GAAP.

Supplemental Financial Information 
 We are providing the following unaudited supplemental financial information regarding our Software Products Services as a lookback of prior years to explain our recent historical and year-over-year performance. 
 The supplemental financial information for our Software Products Services includes: (i) Pro Forma Software Revenue, (ii) Total Software Products Services Customers, (iii) Annual Recurring Revenue, (iv) Total New Bookings, and (iv) Gross Revenue Retention, in each case as defined in the footnotes to the table below. 
 In the past, we have provided supplemental financial information for our Managed Services including average billings per active Managed Services client, and revenue. Because Managed Services will comprise a smaller portion of our business after the Divestiture, we no longer will provide this supplemental information. Prior to the Divestiture, we experienced volatility in revenue from our Managed Services due to a number of factors, including: (i) the timing of new large customer agreements; (ii) loss of customers who chose to replace our services with new providers or by bringing their advertising placement in-house; (iii) customers who experience reductions in their advertising budgets due to issues with their own businesses; and (iv) the seasonality of the campaigns for certain large customers. We historically generated a significant portion of our revenue from a few major customers. After the Divestiture, we expect revenue from our Managed Services to continue to experience volatility. 
 Software Products Services Supplemental Financial Information 
 The following table sets forth the results for each of our Software Products Services supplemental financial information.

(1) All of the supplemental financial information for this period is presented on a Pro Forma basis inclusive of Broadbean. 
 (2) Pro Forma Software Revenue is a non-GAAP measure that represents Software Products Services revenue on a Pro Forma basis. 
 (3) Total Software Products Services Customers includes Software Products Services customers as of the end of each respective quarter set forth above with net revenues in excess of 10 and also excludes any customers categorized by us as trial or pilot status. In prior periods, we provided Ending Software Customers, which represented Software Products Services customers as of the end of each fiscal quarter with trailing twelve-month revenues in excess of 2,400 for both Veritone, Inc. and PandoLogic Ltd. and/or deemed by the Company to be under an active contract for the applicable periods. Total Software Products Services Customers is not comparable to Ending Software Customers. Total Software Products Services Customers includes customers based on revenues in the last month of the quarter rather than on a trailing twelve-month basis. Total Software Products Services Customers includes customers based on revenues in the last month of the quarter rather than on a trailing twelve-month basis and excludes any customers that are on trial or pilot status with us rather than including customers with active contracts. Management uses Total Software Products Services Customers and we believe Total Software Products Services Customers are useful to investors because it more accurately reflects our total customers for our Software Products Services customers inclusive of Broadbean. 
 (4) Annual Recurring Revenue (SaaS) represents an annualized calculation of monthly recurring revenue during the last month of the applicable quarter for all Total Software Products Services customers, in each case on a Pro Forma basis. In prior periods, we provided Average Annual Revenue, which was calculated as the aggregate of trailing twelve-month Software Products Services revenue divided by the average number of customers over the same period for both Veritone, Inc. and PandoLogic Ltd. Annual Recurring Revenue is not comparable to Average Annual Revenue (SaaS). Annual Recurring Revenue (SaaS) includes only subscription-based SaaS revenue, is not averaged among active customers and uses a calculation of recurring revenue as described above instead of annual revenue. Management uses Annual Recurring Revenue (SaaS) and we believe Annual Recurring Revenue (SaaS) is useful to investors because Broadbean significantly increases our mix of subscription-based SaaS revenues as compared to Consumption revenues and the split between the two allows the reader to delineate between predictable recurring SaaS revenues and more volatile Consumption revenues. 
 (5) Annual Recurring Revenue (Consumption) represents the trailing twelve months of all non-recurring and/or consumption-based revenue for all active Total Software Products Services customers, in each case, on a Pro Forma basis. In prior periods, we provided Average Annual Revenue, which was calculated as the aggregate of trailing twelve-month Software Products Services revenue divided by the average number of customers over the same period for both Veritone, Inc. and PandoLogic Ltd. Annual Recurring Revenue (Consumption) is not comparable to Average Annual Revenue. Annual Recurring Revenue (Consumption) includes only non-recurring and/or consumption-based revenue, is not averaged among active customers and uses a calculation of recurring revenue as described above instead of annual revenue. Management uses Annual Recurring Revenue (Consumption) and we believe Annual Recurring Revenue (Consumption) is useful to investors because Broadbean significantly increases our mix of subscription-based SaaS revenues as compared to Consumption revenues and the split between the two allows the reader to delineate between predictable recurring SaaS revenues and more volatile Consumption revenues. 
 (6) Total New Bookings represents the total fees payable during the full contract term for new contracts received in the quarter (including fees payable during any cancellable portion and an estimate of license fees that may fluctuate over the term), excluding any variable fees under the contract (e.g., fees for cognitive processing, storage, professional services and other variable services), in each case on a Pro Forma basis. 
 (7) Gross Revenue Retention represents a calculation of our dollar-based gross revenue retention rate as of the period end by starting with the revenue from Software Products Services Customers as of the 3 months in the prior year quarter to such period, or Prior Year Quarter Revenue. We then deduct from the Prior Year Quarter Revenue any revenue from Software Products Services Customers who are no longer customers as of the current period end, or Current Period Ending Software Customer Revenue. We then divide 
 41 

the total Current Period Ending Software Customer Revenue by the total Prior Year Quarter Revenue to arrive at our dollar-based gross retention rate, which is the percentage of revenue from all Software Products Services Customers from our Software Products Services as of the year prior that is not lost to customer churn. All numbers used to determine Gross Revenue Retention are calculated on a Pro Forma basis. 
 The following table sets forth the reconciliation of revenue to pro forma revenue and the calculation of pro forma annual recurring revenue.

Commercial Enterprise 
 Commercial Enterprise Software Products Services revenue decreased 5.8 million, or 30.6 , in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the corresponding prior year period and decreased 2.8 million, or 6.3 , in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the corresponding prior year period, in each case, primarily due to decreased revenue from one-time software sales and from consumption-based customers, including Amazon, partially offset by the addition of Broadbean in the second quarter of 2023. Commercial Enterprise Managed Services decreased 0.3 million, or 4.0 , in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the corresponding prior year period primarily due to lower revenue from licensing customers, partially offset by increased revenue from representation services. Commercial Enterprise Managed Services increased 0.4 million, or 1.5 , in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the corresponding prior year period, primarily due to lower revenue from licensing customers, partially offset by increased revenue from representation services. 
 Public Sector 
 Public Sector Software Products Services revenue increased 0.1 million, or 8.1 , in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the corresponding prior year period and decreased 0.2 million, or 5.3 , in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the corresponding prior year period, primarily due to fluctuations in timing and magnitude of spend by public safety and federal customers. In some cases, Software Products Services revenue from Public Sector customers in certain markets, particularly our government customers, can be project-based and impacted by the timing of such projects. As such, we expect that our revenue from these markets could fluctuate significantly from period to period

Cost of Revenue. Cost of revenue decreased by 0.7 million and 1.8 million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the corresponding prior year periods, in each case, primarily due to the decline in revenues, especially in the higher margin Software Products Services. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, Software Products Services products accounted for 64.9 of revenues compared to 66.7 in the prior year period. Cost of revenues as a percentage of revenue increased to 28.8 from 25.1 
 44 

in the three months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared a decrease to 27.9 from 29.3 in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Sales and Marketing . Sales and marketing expenses decreased by 0.8 million and 1.7 million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the corresponding prior year periods, in each case, primarily due to cost reduction initiatives announced in the first quarter of 2024 partially offset by increased advertising expense and sales and marketing expense as a result of the acquisition of Broadbean in June 2023. As a percentage of revenue, sales and marketing expenses increased to 46.3 from 39.3 during the three months ended September 30, 2024, and decreased to 44.6 from 45.2 during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Research and Development. Research and development expenses decreased by 2.9 million, or 27.7 , and 9.1 million, or 27.9 , in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared with the corresponding prior year periods, in each case, principally due to decreased personnel-related costs resulting from various cost reduction initiatives, partially offset by increased amortization expenses from increased capitalized costs for internal use software and the acquisition of Broadbean in June 2023. As a percentage of revenue, research and development expenses decreased to 34.2 and 33.3 during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, from 37.2 and 44.6 during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. 
 General and Administrative. General and administrative expenses decreased by 3.8 million, or 21.0 in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared with the corresponding prior year period, principally due to reductions in non-recurring professional fees largely associated with the Broadbean acquisition and personnel-related costs resulting from various cost reduction initiatives. General and administrative expenses decreased by 3.7 million, or 7.6 in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared with the corresponding prior year period, primarily due to the decrease described above, partially offset by a net increase in the first half of 2024 compared to the prior year period driven by increased costs from the June 2023 Broadbean acquisition. 
 Amortization Expense. Amortization expense decreased in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared with the corresponding prior period primarily due to certain intangible assets being fully amortized in the third quarter of 2023, and increased in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared with the corresponding prior year period primarily due to the addition of amortization expense related to our June 2023 acquisition of Broadbean. 
 Other Income (Expense), Net 
 Other expense, net of 2.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to interest expense, net of 3.0 million, driven by increased interest expense from our Term Loan, partially offset by a foreign translation gain of 0.4 million. Other expense, net of 2.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 was comprised primarily of a foreign exchange loss of 2.3 million. Other expense, net of 8.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to interest expense, net of 8.5 million, driven by increased interest expense from our Term Loan. Other income, net of 1.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was comprised primarily of a gain on the sale of the energy group of 2.6 million and a foreign exchange gain of 0.5 million, offset by interest expense, net of 2.1 million. 
 Net income from discontinued operations 
 On October 17, 2024, we consummated the Divestiture. The Divestiture was strategic, allowing us to focus on our AI solutions, and secondarily to improve our financial liquidity with the net proceeds from the Divestiture. During the third quarter of 2024, we determined that Veritone One met the criteria to be classified as discontinued operations. As a result, the historical financial results of Veritone One are reflected in our condensed consolidated financial statements herein as discontinued operations and, as such, have been excluded from continuing operations for all periods presented on a retrospective basis, unless otherwise stated. See Note 3 on Discontinued Operations for more information. 
 Net income from discontinued operations was 0.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and primarily consisted of (i) revenue of 8.6 million, offset by cost of revenue of 0.3 million, other operating expenses of 5.8 million and 1.7 million of net interest expense allocations primarily due to the repayment of our Term Loan as a result of the Divestiture. Net income from discontinued operations was 2.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and primarily consisted of (i) revenue of 23.0 million, offset by cost of revenue of 0.7 million, other operating expenses of 14.7 million and 4.7 million of net interest expense allocations primarily due to the repayment of our Term Loan as a result of the Divestiture.

The improvement in loss from operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year periods resulted primarily from cost reduction initiatives over the trailing eighteen months, offset by the declines in revenue and corresponding decline in Non-GAAP gross profit. The decline in non-GAAP gross margin for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared with the corresponding prior year period was primarily due to the decline in higher margin Commercial Enterprise revenue, including one-time software revenue and consumption based revenue from customers such as Amazon. 
 Liquidity, Capital Resources and Going Concern 
 We have historically financed our business through the sale of equity and debt securities. Our principal sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents, which totaled 11.4 million as of September 30, 2024, compared with total cash and cash equivalents of 46.6 million as of December 31, 2023. The decrease in our cash and cash equivalents as of September 30, 2024 as compared with December 31, 2023 was primarily due to cash used in operating activities of 24.2 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company also had cash from discontinued operations of 34.5 million and 32.8 million, respectively. 
 In December 2023, we and certain of our subsidiaries, as guarantors, entered into a Credit and Guaranty Agreement (the Credit Agreement ), by and among the Company and certain of our subsidiaries, as guarantors, and certain funds managed by Highbridge Capital Management, LLC and with certain other lenders (collectively, the Lenders and Wilmington Savings Fund Society, FSB, as administrative agent and collateral agent. The Credit Agreement provides for a 77.5 million senior secured term loan (the Term Loan ), which was fully drawn by us on closing of the Term Loan. 
 On October 17, 2024, we consummated the Divestiture for a total purchase price of up to 104.0 million. Net proceeds from the transaction were 59.1 million in cash, which reflected the aggregate purchase price of 104.0 million, less 18.0 million subject to the Earnout described below, 20.3 million of purchase price adjustments, and 6.7 million placed in escrow accounts. We may receive the Earnout of up to 18.0 million in cash proceeds based on the achievement of certain net revenue targets by the Divestiture between January 1, 2025 and December 31, 2025. On October 22, 2024, we used net cash proceeds from the Divestiture to repay 30.5 million principal amount of the Term Loan, plus accrued interest and prepayment premiums in the aggregate amount of 3.3 million. As of October 22, 2024, immediately following the Divestiture and the repayment of a portion of our Term Loan, we reported cash on hand of 27.3 million 
 Based on our liquidity position at September 30, 2024 after giving effect to the impact of the Divestiture and the repayment of a portion of our Term Loan, and our current forecast of operating results and cash flows, absent any other action, management determined that there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern over the twelve months following the filing of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, principally driven by our current debt service obligations, historical negative cash flows and recurring losses. We will require additional liquidity to continue our operations over the next twelve months. 
 In the near term, and to meet our obligations as they come due, management is evaluating strategies to obtain funding for future operations. These strategies may include, but are not limited to, obtaining equity financing, debt and/or further restructuring of operations to grow revenues and decrease operating expenses, which include capturing past cost reductions and potential future cost synergies from our past acquisitions. 
 46 

The going concern assumption contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business, including the ability to meet minimum liquidity thresholds under our Term Loan Credit Agreement. We may not be able to access additional equity under acceptable terms, and may not be successful in future operational restructurings, earning any of our deferred purchase consideration, meeting our minimum liquidity threshold under our Credit Agreement, growing our revenue base and our ability to execute on our operating plans may be materially adversely impacted. If we become unable to continue as a going concern, we may have to dispose of other or additional assets and might realize significantly less value than the values at which they are carried on our condensed consolidated financial statements. These actions may cause stockholders to lose all or part of their investment in our common stock. Our condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from our being unable to continue as a going concern. If we cannot continue as a going concern, adjustments to the carrying values and classification of our assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of income and expenses could be required and could be material.

Operating Activities 
 Our operating activities used cash of 24.2 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, due primarily to our net loss of 69.2 million, adjusted by 28.1 million in non-cash expenses, including 21.7 million in depreciation and amortization, 5.9 million in stock-based compensation expense and 4.6 million of amortized debt issuance costs, partially offset by 5.0 million from deferred taxes. Cash used in operating activities in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was partially offset by a net working capital impact of 16.8 million, primarily due to the timing of accrued media payments of 14.0 million and client advances of 19.7 million, partially offset by net cash outflows from expenditures billable to clients of 17.6 million. 
 Our operating activities used cash of 48.1 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023, due primarily to our net loss of 70.8 million, adjusted by 26.7 million in non-cash expenses, including 20.2 million in depreciation and amortization and 8.6 million in stock-based compensation expense, as well as the net working capital decrease of 4.0 million, primarily due to decreases in accrued media payments of 17.7 million, partially offset by decreases in accounts receivable of 14.1 million. 
 Investing Activities 
 Our investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 used cash of 3.3 million driven by capital expenditures, partially offset by proceeds from the sale of our interest in GridBeyond Limited, an Ireland-based privately held company. 
 Our investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 used cash of 53.7 million primarily for 50.2 million in cash paid for the Broadbean acquisition net of cash acquired and 4.0 million in capital expenditures, with these uses of cash partially offset by 0.5 million in proceeds from the Energy Sale. 
 Financing Activities

 Our financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 used cash of 10.5 million, consisting of 7.8 million to pay the 2022 earnout for PandoLogic, 2.7 million in deferred consideration primarily related to the March 2022 Acquisition and the VocaliD acquisition, and 1.1 million to pay taxes paid related to the net share settlement of equity awards, offset by 1.1 million in proceeds received from the exercise of stock options and purchases of shares under our ESPP. 
 Discontinued Operations 
 The cash flows related to discontinued operations have not been segregated and are included in the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows. The total net cash provided by operating activities from discontinued operations was 1.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, which primarily relates to net income from discontinued operations of 2.9 million and the impact from net working capital of 19.9 million, partially offset by net transfers from the Company of 21.4 million. Net cash used in operating activities from discontinued operations was 28.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, which primarily relates to net transfers from the 
 47 

Company of 21.2 million and net income from discontinued operations of 5.3 million, partially offset by the impact from net working capital of 13.9 million. Net cash used in investing activities was 0.2 million and 0.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, related to capital expenditures. 
 Contractual Obligations and Known Future Cash Requirements 
 As of September 30, 2024, our debt obligations are comprised of our Term Loan and our 1.75 convertible senior notes due in 2026 (the Convertible Notes ). As of September 30, 2024, we have 75.6 million principal amount outstanding under our Term Loan that matures in December 2027 and 91.2 million aggregate principal amount outstanding of our Convertible Notes that mature in November 2026. On October 22, 2024, we repaid 30.5 million principal amount of our Term Loan and, after such repayment, 43.1 million principal amount remained outstanding under our Term Loan. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we have no other present agreements or commitments with respect to any material acquisitions of businesses or technologies or any other material capital expenditures. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we have recorded 2.0 million of gross liability for uncertain tax positions, including interest and penalties. Based upon the information available and possible outcomes, we cannot reasonably estimate the amount and period in which the liability might be paid. 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect amounts reported in our condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes, as well as the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. Management evaluates its accounting policies, estimates and judgments on an on-going basis. Management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions. 
 Our critical accounting estimates reflecting management s estimates and judgments are described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. We have reviewed recently adopted accounting pronouncements and determined that the adoption of such pronouncements is not expected to have a material impact, if any, on our condensed consolidated financial statements. Accordingly, there have been no material changes to critical accounting policies and estimates as disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitat ive Disclosures About Market Risk 
 As a smaller reporting company, we are not required to provide the information required by Item 305 of Regulation S-K. 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act as of September 30, 2024. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives of ensuring that information we are required to disclose in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to enable timely decisions regarding required disclosures, and is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms promulgated by the SEC. Our management recognizes that any disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives, and there is no assurance that our disclosure controls and procedures will operate effectively under all circumstances. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective at the reasonable assurance level due to the following material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting. 
 Material Weaknesses in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. 
 During the preparation of our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, management identified a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting as the Company did not have an effective information and communication process that identified and assessed the source of and controls necessary to ensure the reliability of information used in financial reporting and for providing information required for effective activity level controls. This material weakness could have resulted in a material misstatement to the Company's interim condensed consolidated financial statements that would not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. 
 During the preparation of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, management identified the following material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting: 
 Management identified a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting relating to the consolidation process and review of financial statements specifically pertaining to the Company s design of controls to determine proper accounting for certain foreign exchange transactions and translation between Veritone, Inc. and certain foreign subsidiaries. This material weakness did not result in any identified material misstatements to the financial statements. However, this material weakness could have resulted in a material misstatement to the Company s annual or interim condensed consolidated financial statements that would not be prevented or detected and corrected on a timely basis. 

Management identified a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting relating to information technology general controls ITGCs in the areas of user access and change-management over certain information technology IT systems that support our financial reporting processes. The Company s business process automated and manual controls that are dependent on the affected ITGCs were also deemed ineffective because they could have been adversely impacted. These control deficiencies were a result of user access and change management processes over certain IT systems. 

Related to these findings, management concluded that during the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company did not maintain appropriately designed entity-level controls impacting the control environment or monitoring controls to prevent or detect material misstatements to the consolidated financial statements. Specifically, these deficiencies were attributed to (i) a lack of a sufficient number of qualified resources to perform control activities and (ii) insufficient risk assessment and monitoring activities as a result of untimely or ineffective identification of internal control risks to properly design, test, implement and assess effective internal controls over financial reporting. 
 49 

Remediation of Material Weaknesses in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 In order to remediate the material weaknesses, management has taken remediation actions including: 
 (i) engagement of an outside firm to assist with the remediation actions in March 2024; 

(ii) implemented a more robust plan and risk assessment around the proper design, testing and assessment of internal controls over financial reporting in April 2024; 

(iii) implemented a training program addressing ITGCs and policies, including educating control owners concerning the principles and requirements of each control, with a focus on those related to user access and change management over IT systems impacting financial reporting; 

(iv) implemented documentation of underlying ITGCs to promote knowledge transfer upon personnel and function changes; 

(v) implemented an IT management review and testing plan to monitor ITGCs with a specific focus on systems supporting our financial reporting processes; and 

(vi) trained staff on proper accounting for foreign exchange translation, transactions when consolidating foreign subsidiaries and the proper, accurate and timely evaluation of the realizability of long lived assets, including goodwill and intangible assets. Management has also hired additional staff to oversee the implementation and testing of these remediation actions. 

To further remediate the existing material weakness identified herein, the management team, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, have reaffirmed and re-emphasized the importance of internal controls, control consciousness and a strong control environment. We are committed to maintaining a strong control environment and believe that these remediation efforts represent continued improvement in our control environment. 
 We also expect to continue to review, optimize and enhance our financial reporting controls and procedures. While remediating actions have been implemented to mitigate the material weaknesses identified with regards to foreign transaction consolidation and ITGCs, these material weaknesses will not be considered remediated until the applicable remediated and enhanced control processes have operated for a sufficient period of time and management has concluded, through testing, that this enhanced control is operating effectively. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 While management continues to make progress on its remediation efforts, there were no definitive changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls 
 Management recognizes that a control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud or error, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. 
 50 

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 From time to time, we may be involved in litigation relating to claims arising out of our operations in the normal course of business. We currently are not a party to any legal proceedings, the adverse outcome of which, in management s opinion, individually or in the aggregate, would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows. Regardless of the outcome, any litigation could have an adverse impact on us due to defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources and other factors. 
 Item 1A. Ri sk Factors 
 Our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 as supplemented by our Quarterly Report on From 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, contains a discussion of the material risks associated with our business. Other than as set forth below, there have been no material changes to the risks described in such Annual Report on Form 10-K and Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 
 We recently sold Veritone One, our full-service advertising agency, which represented approximately 25 of our revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. As a result, our revenue following the sale of Veritone One will be reduced and our business will be less diversified. 
 On October 17, 2024, we sold our full-service advertising agency and wholly-owned subsidiary, Veritone One, LLC, to an affiliate of Insignia Capital Group L.P. Approximately 25 of our revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was generated from Veritone One. As a result of the Divestiture, our business is focused on enterprise AI and the type of risks associated with such business. Further, immediately following the Divestiture, our business will generate less revenue which may exacerbate risks related to our operations, including our ability to service our outstanding debt and finance our operations. If these difficulties or challenges cannot be overcome, our business may not be successful and the impact of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 Our ability to continue as a going concern depends on, among other factors, our financial condition and operating performance, which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and certain financial, business and other factors beyond our control. 
 Based on our liquidity position at September 30, 2024 and our current forecast of operating results and cash flows, absent any other action, management determined that there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern over the twelve months following the filing of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, principally driven by our current debt service obligations, historical negative cash flows and recurring losses. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on our ability to service our debt obligations under the Term Loan as they become due, which, in turn, is dependent on, among other factors, our financial condition and operating performance, which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and certain financial, business and other factors beyond our control. Our determination that we may be unable to continue as a going concern may materially harm our business and reputation and may make it more difficult for us to obtain financing for the continuation of our operations, including through equity financings, incurring additional debt or otherwise, which in turn, may adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 In the near term, to meet our cash obligations as they come due, we are evaluating strategies to obtain funding for future operations. These strategies may include, but are not limited to, obtaining equity financing, debt and/or further restructuring of operations to grow revenues and decrease operating expenses, which include capturing past cost reduction and potential future cost synergies from our past acquisitions. In addition, on October 17, 2024, we consummated the Divestiture for a total purchase price of up to 104.0 million. Net proceeds from the transaction were 59.1 million in cash, which reflected the aggregate purchase price of 104.0 million, less 18.0 million subject to an earnout described below, 20.3 million of purchase price adjustments, and 6.7 million placed in escrow accounts. On October 22, 2024, we used net cash proceeds from the Divestiture to repay 30.5 million principal amount of our outstanding Term Loan, plus accrued interest and a prepayment premium in the aggregate amount of 3.3 million. As of October 22, 2024, immediately following the Divestiture and the repayment of a portion of our Term Loan, we reported cash on hand of 27.3 million. 
 The going concern assumption contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. We may not be able to access additional equity under acceptable terms, and may not be successful in future operational restructurings or at growing our revenue base. If we are unable to capture past cost reduction and potential future cost synergies from our past acquisitions, we would likely not have sufficient cash on hand or available liquidity to service our current debt obligations, and our ability to execute on our operating plans may be materially adversely impacted. If we become unable to continue as a going concern, we may have to dispose of other or additional assets and might realize significantly less value than the values at which they are carried on our condensed consolidated financial statements. These actions may cause stockholders to lose all or part of their investment in our common stock. If we cannot continue as a going concern, adjustments to the carrying values and classification of our assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of income and expenses could be required and could be material.

Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equi ty Securities and Use of Proceeds 
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we issued 0 and 298,110 shares of our common stock Common Stock to certain Warrant Holders upon the exercise of 0 and 499,857 warrants held by them, respectively. Each warrant was cashless exercised at a strike price of 2.5760. The shares of Common Stock issued upon exercise of these warrants were issued in reliance on an exemption from registration provided by Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act. Each of the Warrant Holders represented that they were acquiring the warrants and, upon any exercise thereof, will acquire shares of Common Stock issuable upon such exercise, for such Warrant Holder s own account and not with a view to distribution or resale in violation of the Securities Act or any applicable state securities law.
