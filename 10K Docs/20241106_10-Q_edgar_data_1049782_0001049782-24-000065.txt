 Investment Securities as Collateral 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, million and million of investment securities were pledged as collateral for repurchase agreements; municipal deposits; treasury, tax and loan deposits; swap agreements; FRB borrowings; and FHLB borrowings. The Banks had outstanding FRB borrowings as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
 Allowance for Credit Losses-Available-for-Sale Securities 
 For available-for-sale securities in an unrealized loss position, management first assesses whether (i) the Company intends to sell the security, or (ii) it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. If either criterion is met, any previously recognized allowances are charged-off and the security's amortized cost is written down to fair value through income. If neither criterion is met, the security is evaluated to determine whether the decline in fair value has resulted from credit losses or other factors. In making this assessment, management considers the extent to which fair value is less than amortized cost, any changes to the rating of the security by a rating agency and any adverse conditions specifically related to the security, among other factors. 
 If this assessment indicates that a credit loss exists, the present value of cash flows expected to be collected from the security is compared to the amortized cost basis of the security. If the present value of cash flows expected to be collected is less than the amortized cost basis, an allowance for credit loss is recorded, limited by the amount that the fair value is less than the amortized cost basis. Any impairment that has not been recorded through the ACL is recognized in OCI. Adjustments to the allowance are reported as a component of credit loss expense. Available-for-sale securities are charged-off against the allowance or, in the absence of any allowance, written down through income when deemed uncollectible or when either of the aforementioned criteria regarding intent or requirement to sell is met. The Company has made the accounting policy election to exclude accrued interest receivable on available-for-sale securities from the estimate of credit losses. Accrued interest receivables associated with debt securities available-for-sale totaled million, as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
 A debt security is placed on nonaccrual status at the time any principal or interest payments become more than days delinquent or if full collection of interest or principal becomes uncertain. Accrued interest for a debt security placed on nonaccrual is reversed against interest income. There were no debt securities on nonaccrual status and therefore there was no accrued interest related to debt securities reversed against interest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

 The Company performs regular analyses of the investment securities available-for-sale portfolio to determine whether a decline in fair value indicates that an investment security is impaired. In making these impairment determinations, management considers, among other factors, projected future cash flows; credit subordination and the creditworthiness; capital adequacy and near-term prospects of the issuers. 
 Management also considers the Company's capital adequacy, interest-rate risk, liquidity and business plans in assessing whether it is more likely than not that the Company will sell or be required to sell the investment securities before recovery. If the Company determines that a security investment is impaired and that it is more likely than not that the Company will not sell or be required to sell the investment security before recovery of its amortized cost, the credit portion of the impairment loss is recognized in the Company's consolidated statement of income and the noncredit portion is recognized in accumulated OCI. The credit portion of the impairment represents the difference between the amortized cost and the present value of the expected future cash flows of the investment security. If the Company determines that a security is impaired and it is more likely than not

 million, all of which were backed explicitly by the full faith and credit of the U.S. Government, compared to million as of December 31, 2023. 
 All securities are performing and backed by the implicit (FHLB/FNMA/FHLMC) or explicit (GNMA/SBA) guarantee of the U.S. Government. Therefore, despite unrealized losses in some of the securities within the portfolio, management has determined that the investment securities are impaired. See discussion on the portfolio below.

 Municipal Obligations 
 The Company invests in certain state and municipal securities with high credit ratings for portfolio diversification and tax planning purposes. Full collection of the obligations is expected because the financial conditions of the issuing municipalities are sound, they have not defaulted on scheduled payments, the obligations are rated investment grade, and the Company has the ability and intent to hold the obligations for a period of time to recover the amortized cost. As of September 30, 2024, the Company owned municipal obligation securities with a total fair value of million and a net unrealized gain of million. As of December 31, 2023, the Company owned municipal obligation securities with a total fair value of million and a net unrealized gain of million.

 Portfolio Maturities 
 After 1 year through 5 years After 5 years through 10 years Over 10 years 
 Actual maturities of debt securities will differ from those presented above since certain obligations amortize and may also provide the issuer the right to call or prepay the obligation prior to scheduled maturity without penalty. MBSs and CMOs are included above based on their final stated maturities; the actual maturities, however, may occur earlier due to anticipated prepayments and stated amortization of cash flows. 
 As of September 30, 2024, issuers of debt securities with an estimated fair value of million had the right to call or prepay the obligations. Of the million, approximately million matures in less then 1 year, million matures in 1-5 years, million matures in 6-10 years, and million matures after ten years.

 Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses Methodology 
 Management has established a methodology to determine the adequacy of the ACL that assesses the risks and losses expected on the loan and lease portfolio and unfunded commitments. Additions to the ACL are made by charges to the provision for credit losses. Losses on loans and leases are charged off against the allowance when all or a portion of a loan or lease is considered uncollectible. Subsequent recoveries on loans previously charged off, if any, are credited to the allowance when realized. 
 To calculate the allowance for loans collectively evaluated, management uses models developed by a third party. CRE, C I, and retail lifetime loss rate models calculate the expected losses over the life of the loan based on exposure at default loan attributes and reasonable, supportable economic forecasts. The exposure at default considers the current unpaid balance, prepayment assumptions and expected utilization assumptions. The expected loss estimates for two small commercial portfolios are based on historical loss rates. 
 Key assumptions used in the models include portfolio segmentation, prepayments, and the expected utilization of unfunded commitments, among others. The portfolios are segmented by loan level attributes such as loan type, loan size, date of origination, and delinquency status to create homogenous loan pools. Pool level metrics are calculated and loss rates are subsequently applied to the pools as the loans have like characteristics. Prepayment assumptions are embedded within the models and are based on the same data used for model development and incorporate adjustments for reasonable and supportable forecasts. Model development data and developmental time periods vary by model, but all use at least ten years of historical data and capture at least one recessionary period. Expected utilization is based on current utilization and a LEQ factor. LEQ

 from the forecast start date and largely completes within the first . Because the reasonable and supportable economic forecasts used in the models are mean reverting, the models are therefore considered to be implicitly mean reverting. 
 Management elected to use multiple economic forecasts in determining the reserve to account for economic uncertainty. The forecasts include various projections of gross domestic product, interest rates, property price indices, and employment measures. Scenario weighting and model parameters are reviewed for each calculation and updated to reflect facts and circumstances as of the financial statement date. The forecasts utilized at September 30, 2024 reflect the immediate and longer-term effects of a higher interest rate environment and inflationary conditions compared to recent history. 
 As of September 30, 2024, management applied qualitative adjustments to the CRE lifetime loss rate, C I lifetime loss rate, and Retail lifetime loss rate models. These adjustments addressed model limitations, were based on historical loss patterns, and targeted specific risks within the certain portfolios. A general qualitative adjustment was applied to all models to account for general economic uncertainty by placing a greater probability on negative economic forecasts. Additional qualitative factors were applied to capture specific risks in several sub-segments of the portfolio determined to have potential incremental risk relative to the model s results (e.g., office and specialty vehicle) based on recent collateral valuations and performance trends. These adjustments included both positive and negative adjustments and were applied to different sub-segments with a total impact of million at September 30, 2024. Management reviews these factors on a quarterly basis as market conditions and segment performance evolve. 
 Specific reserves are established for loans individually evaluated for impairment when amortized cost basis is greater than the discounted present value of expected future cash flows or, in the case of collateral-dependent loans, when there is an excess of a loan's amortized cost basis over the fair value of its underlying collateral. When loans and leases do not share risk characteristics with other financial assets they are evaluated individually. Individually evaluated loans are reviewed quarterly with adjustments made to the calculated reserve as necessary. 
 The general allowance for loan and lease losses was million as of September 30, 2024 and million as of December 31, 2023. 
 The specific allowance for loan and lease losses was million as of September 30, 2024, compared to million as of December 31, 2023. The specific allowance increased million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to specific reserve increases totaling million for equipment financing loans, million for commercial real estate loans, and million for consumer and industrial loans. 
 As of September 30, 2024, management believes that the methodology for calculating the allowance is sound and that the allowance provides a reasonable basis for determining and reporting on expected losses over the lifetime of the Company s loan portfolios. 
 Credit Quality Assessment 
 At the time of loan origination, a rating is assigned based on the capacity to pay and general financial strength of the borrower, the value of assets pledged as collateral, and the evaluation of third party support such as a guarantor. The Company continually monitors the credit quality of the loan portfolio using all available information. The officer responsible for handling each loan is required to initiate changes to risk ratings when changes in facts and circumstances occur that warrant an upgrade or downgrade in a loan rating. Based on this information, loans demonstrating certain payment issues or other weaknesses may be categorized as delinquent, adversely risk-rated, nonperforming and/or put on nonaccrual status. Additionally, in the course of resolving such loans, the Company may choose to restructure the contractual terms of certain loans to match the borrower's ability to repay the loan based on their current financial condition. If a restructured loan meets certain criteria, it may be categorized as a modified loan. 
 The Company reviews numerous credit quality indicators when assessing the risk in its loan portfolio. For all loans, the Company utilizes an eight-grade loan rating system, which assigns a risk rating to each borrower based on a number of quantitative and qualitative factors associated with a loan transaction. Factors considered include industry and market

 Impaired Loans and Leases 
 A loan is considered to be impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect all amounts due (both interest and principal) according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. The loans and leases risk-rated "substandard" or worse are considered impaired. Impaired loans and leases which do not share similar risk characteristics with other loans are individually evaluated for credit losses. Specific reserves are established for loans and leases with deterioration in the present value of expected future cash flows or, in the case of collateral-dependent loans and leases, any increase in the loan or lease amortized cost basis over the fair value of the underlying collateral discounted for estimated selling costs. In contrast, the loans and leases which share similar risk characteristics and are not included in the individually evaluated population are collectively evaluated for credit losses.

 The Company utilizes risk participation agreements with other banks participating in commercial loan arrangements. Participating banks guarantee the performance on borrower-related interest rate swap contracts. Risk participation agreements are derivative financial instruments and are recorded at fair value. These derivatives are not designated as hedges and therefore, changes in fair value are recorded directly through earnings in other non-interest income at each reporting period. Under a risk participation-out agreement, a derivative asset, the Company participates out a portion of the credit risk associated with the interest rate swap position executed with the commercial borrower, for a fee paid to the participating bank. 
 The Company offers foreign exchange contracts to commercial borrowers to accommodate their business needs. These foreign exchange contracts do not qualify as hedges for accounting purposes. To mitigate the market and liquidity risk associated with these foreign exchange contracts, the Company enters into similar offsetting positions. 
 Asset derivatives and liability derivatives are included in other assets and accrued expenses and other liabilities on the unaudited consolidated balance sheets.

 Of the awarded shares under the Plans, generally vest ratably over with one-third of such shares vesting at each of the first, second and third anniversary dates of the awards. The remaining of each award will vest after the award date based on the level of the Company's achievement of identified performance targets in comparison to the level of achievement of such identified performance targets by a defined peer group. If a participant leaves the Company prior to the third anniversary date of an award, any unvested shares are usually forfeited. Dividends declared with respect to shares awarded will be held by the Company and paid to the participant only when the shares vest. 
 
 Under the Plans, shares of the Company's common stock are reserved for issuance as restricted stock awards to officers, employees, and non-employee directors of the Company.

 Investment Securities Available-for-Sale 
 The fair value of investment securities is based principally on market prices and dealer quotes received from third-party and nationally-recognized pricing services for identical investment securities such as U.S. Treasury and agency securities. These prices are validated by comparing the primary pricing source with an alternative pricing source when available. When quoted market prices for identical securities are unavailable, the Company uses market prices provided by independent pricing services based on recent trading activity and other observable information, including but not limited to market interest-rate curves, referenced credit spreads and estimated prepayment speeds, where applicable. These investments include GSE debentures, GSE mortgage-related securities, SBA commercial loan asset backed securities, corporate debt obligations, municipal obligations and trust preferred securities, all of which are included in Level 2. As of September 30, 2024, million of investment securities available-for-sale are included in Level 3 within the investment portfolio. The composition of these assets are primarily composed of subordinated debt of local banks and private placement municipal securities. Of these securities, approximately million are private placement municipal Bond Anticipation Notes. As of December 31, 2023, certain corporate debt securities and municipal obligations were valued using pricing models included in Level 3. 
 Additionally, management reviews changes in fair value from period to period and performs testing to ensure that prices received from the third parties are consistent with management's expectation of the market. Changes in the prices obtained from the pricing service are analyzed from month to month, taking into consideration changes in market conditions including changes in mortgage spreads, changes in U.S. Treasury security yields and changes in generic pricing of -year and -year securities. Additional analysis may include a review of prices provided by other independent parties, a yield analysis, a review of average life changes using Bloomberg analytics and a review of historical pricing for a particular security. 
 Derivatives and Hedging Instruments 
 The fair value of interest rate derivatives designated as hedging instruments, loan level derivatives, risk participation agreements (RPA in/out), and foreign exchange contracts represent a Level 2 valuation and are based on settlement values adjusted for credit risks associated with the counterparties and the Company and observable market interest rate curves and foreign exchange rates where applicable.

 Loans and Leases 
 The fair values of performing loans and leases was estimated by segregating the portfolio into its primary loan and lease categories commercial real estate mortgage, multi-family mortgage, construction, commercial, equipment financing, condominium association, residential mortgage, home equity and other consumer. These categories were further disaggregated based upon significant financial characteristics such as type of interest rate (fixed / variable) and payment status (current / past-due). Using the exit price valuation method, the Company discounts the contractual cash flows for each loan category using interest rates currently being offered for loans with similar terms to borrowers of similar quality and incorporates estimates of future loan prepayments. 
 Deposits 
 The fair values of deposit liabilities with no stated maturity (demand, NOW, savings and money market savings accounts) are equal to the carrying amounts payable on demand. The fair value of certificates of deposit represents contractual cash flows discounted using interest rates currently offered on deposits with similar characteristics and remaining maturities. The fair value estimates for deposits do not include the benefit that results from the low-cost funding provided by the Company's core deposit relationships (deposit-based intangibles).

 Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require the payment of a fee by the customer. Since some of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. The Company evaluates each customer's creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral obtained, if any, is based on management's credit evaluation of the borrower. 
 Standby and commercial letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the Company to guarantee performance of a customer to a third party. These standby and commercial letters of credit are primarily issued to support the financing needs of the Company's commercial customers. The credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loans to customers. 
 From time to time, the Company enters into loan level derivatives, risk participation agreements or foreign exchange contracts with commercial customers and third-party financial institutions. These derivatives allow the Company to offer long-term fixed-rate commercial loans while mitigating the interest-rate or foreign exchange risk of holding those loans. In a loan level derivative transaction, the Company lends to a commercial customer on a floating-rate basis and then enters into a loan level derivative with that customer. Concurrently, the Company enters into offsetting swaps with a third-party financial institution, effectively minimizing its net interest-rate risk exposure resulting from such transactions. The fair value of these derivatives are presented in Note 8.

 Introduction 
 Brookline Bancorp, Inc., a Delaware corporation, operates as a multi-bank holding company for Brookline Bank and its subsidiaries; BankRI and its subsidiaries; PCSB Bank and its subsidiaries; and Clarendon Private. Brookline Securities Corp, previously a subsidiary of Brookline Bancorp, Inc., was dissolved in November 2023. 
 As a commercially-focused financial institution with 64 full-service banking offices throughout Greater Boston, the north shore of Massachusetts, Rhode Island and New York, the Company, through Brookline Bank, BankRI and PCSB Bank, offers a wide range of commercial, business and retail banking services, including a full complement of cash management products, foreign exchange services, on-line and mobile banking services, consumer and residential loans and investment advisory services, designed to meet the financial needs of small- to mid-sized businesses and individuals throughout central New England and the Lower Hudson Valley in New York. The Banks and their subsidiaries lend primarily in all New England states and New York, with the exception of the equipment financing portfolio, 29.6 of which is in the Greater New York and New Jersey metropolitan area and 70.4 of which is in other areas in the U.S. as of September 30, 2024. Clarendon Private is a registered investment advisor with the SEC. Through Clarendon Private, the Company offers a wide range of wealth management services to individuals, families, endowments and foundations to help these clients meet their long-term financial goals. 
 The Company focuses its business efforts on profitably growing its commercial lending businesses, both organically and through acquisitions. The Company s customer focus, multi-bank structure, and risk management are integral to its organic growth strategy and serve to differentiate the Company from its competitors. As full-service financial institutions, the Banks and their subsidiaries focus their efforts on developing and deepening long-term banking relationships with qualified customers through a full complement of products, excellent customer service, and strong risk management. 
 The Company manages the Banks under a uniform strategic objective, with one set of uniform policies consistently applied by one executive management team. Within this environment, the Company believes that the ability to make customer

 decisions locally enhances management's motivation, service levels and, as a consequence, the Company's financial results. As such, while most back-office functions are consolidated at the holding company level, branding and decision-making, including credit decisions and pricing, remain largely local in order to better meet the needs of bank customers and further motivate the Banks commercial, business and retail bankers. These credit decisions, at the local level, are executed in accordance with corporate policies overseen by the Company's credit department. 
 The competition for loans and leases and deposits remains strong, with growth and pricing influenced by the Federal Reserve's interest rate-setting actions. Management's scenario analysis of deposit sensitivity to the current rate environment and customer demand for non-depository investment alternatives suggests further deposit mix migration and increased sensitivity to interest rates. 
 As the interest rate environment resets to a more normal, upward-sloping yield curve with shorter-term interest rates lower than longer-tem interest rates, management expects the net interest margin to increase. This is due to deposit and wholesale funding costs repricing, while legacy loans do not reprice down with the same magnitude. 
 However, if both short- and long-term interest rates both fall, net interest income models, using a projected flat balance sheet with stable deposit balances and an average sensitivity of deposit rates of approximately 40 to market rates, forecast that a parallel decrease in rates will negatively affect the Company's net interest income, net interest spread, and net interest margin. Note, while our long term historical sensitivity of deposit rates approximates 40 , more recently, deposit rate sensitivity has been much higher, which if continues in the future would have a more neutral or positive impact on the net interest income. 
 As discussed above, changes in interest rates could also precipitate a change in the mix and volume of the Company's deposits and loans. The future operating results of the Company will depend on its ability to maintain or increase the current net interest income, manage credit risk, increase sources of non-interest income, while managing non-interest expenses. 
 The Company and the Banks are supervised, examined and regulated by the FRB. As a Massachusetts-chartered trust company, Brookline Bank is subject to supervision, examination and regulation by the Massachusetts Division of Banks. As a Rhode Island-chartered financial institution, BankRI is subject to examination, supervision and regulation by the Banking Division of the Rhode Island Department of Business Regulation. As a New York-chartered commercial bank, PCSB Bank is subject to regulation, supervision and examination by the New York State Department of Financial Services. The FDIC insures each of the Banks deposits up to 250,000 per depositor. 
 The Company s common stock is traded on the Nasdaq Global Select Market SM under the symbol BRKL.

Net charge-offs for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were 3.8 million, or 0.16 of average loans and leases on an annualized basis, compared to 11.0 million, or 0.47 of average loans and leases on an annualized basis, for the three months ended September 30, 2023.

 Net Income 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company reported net income of 20.1 million, or 0.23 per basic and diluted share, a decrease of 2.6 million, or 11.3 , from net income of 22.7 million, or 0.26 per basic and diluted share, for the three months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease in net income is primarily the result of an increase in provision for credit losses on loans of 1.9 million, a decrease in net interest income of 1.1 million, and an increase in the provision for income taxes of 0.4 million, partially offset by an increase in non-interest income of 0.8 million. Refer to Results of Operations" below for further discussion. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company reported net income of 51.2 million, or 0.58 and 0.57 per basic and diluted share, respectively, a decrease of 0.9 million, or 1.8 , from 52.1 million, or 0.59 per basic and diluted share for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease in net income is primarily the result of a decrease in net interest income of 11.6 million, a decrease in non-interest income of 4.9 million, and an increase in the provision for income taxes of 3.5 million, partially offset by a decrease in the provision for credit losses on loans of 16.2 million, a decrease in non-interest expense of 2.1 million, and a decrease in the provision for credit losses on investments of 0.7 million which were all elevated in 2023 due to the acquisition of PCSB. Refer to Results of Operations" below for further discussion. 
 The annualized return on average assets was 0.70 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 0.81 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The annualized return on average stockholders' equity was 6.63 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 7.78 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 The net interest margin was 3.07 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, down from 3.18 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in the net interest margin is a result of an increase of 51 basis points in the Company's cost of interest-bearing liabilities to 3.67 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 3.16 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, partially offset by an increase in the yield on interest-earning assets of 32 basis points to 5.93 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 5.61 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 The net interest margin was 3.05 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, down from 3.27 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in the net interest margin is a result of an increase of 76 basis points in the Company's cost of interest bearing liabilities to 3.63 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 2.87 for the nine months

 ended September 30, 2023, partially offset by an increase in the yield on interest-earning assets of 44 basis points to 5.84 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 5.40 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 The Company s net interest margin and net interest income are sensitive to the structure and level of interest rates as well as competitive pricing in all loan and deposit categories. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 The SEC defines critical accounting policies as those involving significant judgments and difficult or complex assumptions by management, often as a result of the need to make estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain or variable, which have, or could have, a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets or net income. The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results could differ from those estimates. As discussed in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, management has identified the determination of the ACL, the review of goodwill for impairment and business combinations as the Company s most critical accounting policies. 
 Recent Accounting Developments 
 In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, "Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures" which improves reportable segment disclosure requirements, particularly regarding a reportable segment s expenses. This update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Management has determined that ASU 2023-07 does apply to the Company and is currently determining the impact as of September 30, 2024. 
 In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, "Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures" to enhance the annual income tax disclosure requirements. This update is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. Management has determined that ASU 2023-09 does apply to the Company and is currently determining the impact as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Reconciliation to GAAP 
 In addition to evaluating the Company s results of operations in accordance with GAAP, management periodically supplements this evaluation with an analysis of certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as operating earnings metrics, the return on average tangible assets, return on average tangible equity, the tangible stockholders' equity to tangible assets ratio, tangible book value per share, and dividend payout ratio. Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide information useful to investors in understanding the Company s underlying operating performance and trends, and facilitates comparisons with the performance assessment of financial performance, including non-interest expense control, while the tangible equity ratio and tangible book value per share are used to analyze the relative strength of the Company s capital position. 
 The following table reconciles the Company s operating earnings, operating return on average assets and operating return on average stockholders equity for the periods indicated:

 The following table sets forth the growth in the Company s loan and lease portfolios during the nine months ended September 30, 2024: 
 At September 30, 2024 At December 31, 2023 Dollar Change Percent Change (Annualized) (Dollars in Thousands) Commercial real estate 5,779,290 5,764,529 14,761 0.3 Commercial 2,453,038 2,399,668 53,370 3.0 Consumer 1,522,908 1,477,392 45,516 4.1 Total loans and leases 9,755,236 9,641,589 113,647 1.6 
 The Company's loan portfolio consists primarily of first mortgage loans secured by commercial, multi-family and residential real estate properties located in the Company's primary lending area, loans to business entities, including commercial lines of credit, loans to condominium associations and loans and leases used to finance equipment used by small businesses. The Company also provides financing for construction and development projects, home equity and other consumer loans. 
 The Company employs seasoned commercial lenders and retail bankers who rely on community and business contacts as well as referrals from customers, attorneys and other professionals to generate loans and deposits. Existing borrowers are also an important source of business since many of them have more than one loan outstanding with the Company. The Company's ability to originate loans depends on the strength of the economy, trends in interest rates, and levels of customer demand and market competition. 
 The Company's current policy is that a total credit exposure to one obligor relationship may not exceed 60.0 million unless approved by the Company's Credit Committee. As of September 30, 2024, there were five borrowers with loans and commitments over 60.0 million. The total of those loans and commitments was 335.7 million, or 2.86 of total loans and commitments, as of September 30, 2024. As of December 31, 2023, there were four borrowers with loans and commitments 
 58 

Table of Contents 

 over 60.0 million. The total of those loans and commitments was 259.5 million, or 2.2 of total loans and commitments, as of December 31, 2023. 
 The Company has written underwriting policies to control the inherent risks in loan origination. The policies address approval limits, loan-to-value ratios, appraisal requirements, debt service coverage ratios, loan concentration limits and other matters relevant to loan underwriting. 
 Commercial Real Estate Loans 
 The commercial real estate portfolio is composed of commercial real estate loans, multi-family mortgage loans, and construction loans and is the largest component of the Company's overall loan portfolio, representing 59.2 of total loans and leases outstanding as of September 30, 2024. 
 Typically, commercial real estate loans are larger in size and involve a greater degree of risk than owner-occupied residential mortgage loans. Loan repayment is usually dependent on the successful operation and management of the properties and the value of the properties securing the loans. Economic conditions can greatly affect cash flows and property values. 
 A number of factors are considered in originating commercial real estate and multi-family mortgage loans. The qualifications and financial condition of the borrower (including credit history), as well as the potential income generation and the value and condition of the underlying property, are evaluated. When evaluating the qualifications of the borrower, the Company considers the financial resources of the borrower, the borrower's experience in owning or managing similar property and the borrower's payment history with the Company and other financial institutions. Factors considered in evaluating the underlying property include the net operating income of the mortgaged premises before debt service and depreciation, the debt service coverage ratio (the ratio of cash flow before debt service to debt service), the use of conservative capitalization rates, and the ratio of the loan amount to the appraised value. Generally, personal guarantees are obtained from commercial real estate loan borrowers. 
 Commercial real estate and multi-family mortgage loans are typically originated for terms of five to fifteen years with amortization periods of 20 to 30 years. Many of the loans are priced at inception on a fixed-rate basis generally for periods ranging from two to five years with repricing periods for longer-term loans. When possible, prepayment penalties are included in loan covenants on these loans. For commercial customers who are interested in loans with terms longer than five years, the Company offers loan level derivatives to accommodate customer need. 
 The Company's urban and suburban market area is characterized by a large number of apartment buildings, condominiums and office buildings. As a result, commercial real estate and multi-family mortgage lending has been a significant part of the Company's activities for many years. These types of loans typically generate higher yields, but also involve greater credit risk. Many of the Company's borrowers have more than one multi-family or commercial real estate loan outstanding with the Company. 
 The Company's commercial real estate portfolio is composed primarily of loans secured by apartment buildings 1.4 billion), retail stores 959.5 million), industrial properties 855.2 million), office buildings 776.8 million), mixed-use properties 514.7 million), lodging services 204.5 million), and food services 79.4 million) as of September 30, 2024. At that date, approximately 77.8 of the commercial real estate loans outstanding were secured by properties located in New England; primarily in the Greater Boston and Greater Providence markets, with additional exposure of approximately 16.5 of the commercial real estate loans outstanding were also secured by properties in the State of New York, nearly all of which is in the Lower Hudson Valley region.

 Construction and development financing is generally considered to involve a higher degree of risk than long-term financing on improved, occupied real estate and thus has lower concentration limits than do other commercial credit classes. Risk of loss on a construction loan is largely dependent upon the accuracy of the initial estimate of construction costs, the estimated time to sell or rent the completed property at an adequate price or rate of occupancy, and market conditions. If the estimates and projections prove to be inaccurate, the Company may be confronted with a project which, upon completion, has a value that is insufficient to assure full loan repayment. 
 Criteria applied in underwriting construction loans for which the primary source of repayment is the sale of the property are different from the criteria applied in underwriting construction loans for which the primary source of repayment is the stabilized cash flow from the completed project. For those loans where the primary source of repayment is from resale of the property, in addition to the normal credit analysis performed for other loans, the Company also analyzes project costs, the attractiveness of the property in relation to the market in which it is located and demand within the market area. For those construction loans where the source of repayment is the stabilized cash flow from the completed project, the Company analyzes not only project costs but also how long it might take to achieve satisfactory occupancy and the reasonableness of projected rental rates in relation to market rental rates. 
 Commercial Loans 
 The Company's commercial loan and lease portfolio is composed of commercial loans, equipment financing loans and leases and condominium association loans, which represented 25.2 of total loans outstanding as of September 30, 2024. 
 The Company's commercial loan and lease portfolio is composed primarily of loans and leases to small to medium sized businesses 893.0 million), transportation services 331.2 million), food services 272.3 million), recreation services 123.4 million), manufacturing 144.4 million), retail 157.6 million), and rental and leasing services 88.7 million) as of September 30, 2024. 
 The Company provides commercial banking services to companies in its market areas. Approximately 40.6 of the commercial loans outstanding as of September 30, 2024 were made to borrowers located in New England. The remaining 59.4 of the commercial loans outstanding were made to borrowers in other areas in the U.S., primarily by the Company's 
 60

 equipment financing divisions. Product offerings include lines of credit, term loans, letters of credit, deposit services and cash management. These types of credit facilities have as their primary source of repayment cash flows from the operations of businesses. Interest rates offered are available on a floating basis tied to the prime rate or a similar index or on a fixed-rate basis referenced on the FHLB indices. 
 Credit extensions are made to established businesses on the basis of loan purpose and assessment of capacity to repay as determined by an analysis of their financial statements, the nature of collateral to secure the credit extension and, in most instances, the personal guarantee of the owner of the business as well as industry and general economic conditions. 
 The Company s equipment financing divisions focus on market niches in which its lenders have deep experience and industry contacts, and on making loans to customers with business experience. An important part of the Company s equipment financing loan origination volume comes from equipment manufacturers, distributors, and owner-operated start-ups as well as existing customers that are expanding their operations. The equipment financing portfolio is composed primarily of loans to finance vended-laundry, and to a lesser degree larger industrial laundries, tow trucks, fitness, and convenience/grocery stores. Approximately 18.5 of all loans outstanding in the equipment financing divisions were made to finance assets located in the state of New York. Typically, the loans are priced at a fixed rate of interest and require monthly payments over their 5- to 10-year life. The yields earned on equipment financing loans are higher than those earned on the commercial loans made by the Banks because they involve a higher degree of credit risk. Equipment financing customers are typically small-business owners who operate with limited financial resources and who face greater risks when the economy weakens or unforeseen adverse events arise. Because of these characteristics, personal guarantees of borrowers are usually obtained along with liens on available assets. The size of loan is determined by an analysis of cash flow and other characteristics pertaining to the business and the equipment to be financed, based on detailed revenue and profitability data of similar operations. 
 Loans to condominium associations are for the purpose of funding capital improvements, are made for five- to ten-year terms and are secured by a general assignment of condominium association revenues. Among the factors considered in the underwriting of such loans are the level of owner occupancy, the financial condition and history of the condominium association, the attractiveness of the property in relation to the market in which it is located and the reasonableness of estimates of the cost of capital improvements to be made. Depending on loan size, funds are advanced as capital improvements are made and, in more complex situations, after completion of engineering inspections. 
 Consumer Loans 
 The consumer loan portfolio, which is composed of residential mortgage loans, home equity loans and lines of credit, and other consumer loans, represented 15.6 of total loans outstanding as of September 30, 2024. The Company focuses its mortgage and home equity lending on existing and new customers within its branch networks in its urban and suburban marketplaces in the Greater Boston and Providence metropolitan areas along with the Lower Hudson Valley area of New York. 
 The Company originates adjustable- and fixed-rate residential mortgage loans secured by one- to four-family residences. Each residential mortgage loan granted is subject to a satisfactorily completed application, employment verification, credit history and a demonstrated ability to repay the debt. Generally, loans are not made when the loan-to-value ratio exceeds 80 unless private mortgage insurance is obtained and/or there is a financially strong guarantor. Appraisals are performed by outside independent fee appraisers. 
 Underwriting guidelines for home equity loans and lines of credit are similar to those for residential mortgage loans. Home equity loans and lines of credit are limited to no more than 80 of the appraised value of the property securing the loan including the amount of any existing first mortgage liens. 
 Other consumer loans have historically been a modest part of the Company's loan originations. As of September 30, 2024, other consumer loans equaled 57.6 million, or 0.6 of total loans outstanding. 
 
 Asset Quality 
 Criticized and Classified Assets 
 The Company's management rates certain loans and leases as OAEM, "substandard" or "doubtful" based on criteria established under banking regulations. These loans and leases are collectively referred to as "criticized" assets. Loans and leases rated OAEM have potential weaknesses that deserve management's close attention. If left uncorrected, these potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects of the loan or lease at some future date. Loans and leases rated as substandard are inadequately protected by the payment capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. Substandard loans and leases have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of debt and are characterized by the distinct possibility that the Company will sustain some loss if existing deficiencies are not corrected. Loans and leases rated as doubtful have well-defined weaknesses that jeopardize the orderly liquidation of debt and partial loss of

 principal is likely. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had 242.8 million of total assets that were designated as criticized. This compares to 128.0 million of assets designated as criticized as of December 31, 2023. The increase of 114.8 million in criticized assets was primarily driven by increases in commercial real estate, equipment financing, construction, and multi-family relationships, and offset by a decrease in commercial relationships, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Nonperforming Assets 
 "Nonperforming assets" consist of nonaccrual loans and leases, OREO and other repossessed assets. Under certain circumstances, the Company may restructure the terms of a loan or lease as a concession to a borrower, except for acquired loans and leases which are individually evaluated against expected performance on the date of acquisition. These restructured loans and leases are generally considered "nonperforming loans and leases" until a history of collection of at least six months on the restructured terms of the loan or lease has been established. OREO consists of real estate acquired through foreclosure proceedings and real estate acquired through acceptance of a deed in lieu of foreclosure. Other repossessed assets consist of assets that have been acquired through foreclosure that are not real estate and are included in other assets on the Company's unaudited consolidated balance sheets. 
 Accrual of interest on loans generally is discontinued when contractual payment of principal or interest becomes past due 90 days or, if in management's judgment, reasonable doubt exists as to the full timely collection of interest. When a loan is placed on nonaccrual status, interest accruals cease and all previously accrued and uncollected interest is reversed and charged against current interest income. Interest payments on nonaccrual loans are generally applied to principal. If collection of the principal is reasonably assured, interest payments are recognized as income on the cash basis. Loans are generally returned to accrual status when principal and interest payments are current, full collectability of principal and interest is reasonably assured and a consistent record of at least six months of performance has been achieved. 
 In cases where a borrower experiences financial difficulties and the Company makes or reasonably expects to make certain concessionary modifications to contractual terms, the loan is classified as a modified loan. In determining whether a debtor is experiencing financial difficulties, the Company considers, among other factors, if the debtor is in payment default or is likely to be in payment default in the foreseeable future without the modification, the debtor declared or is in the process of declaring bankruptcy, there is substantial doubt that the debtor will continue as a going concern, the debtor's entity-specific projected cash flows will not be sufficient to service its debt, or the debtor cannot obtain funds from sources other than the existing creditors at market terms for debt with similar risk characteristics. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company had nonperforming assets of 72.8 million, representing 0.62 of total assets, compared to nonperforming assets of 45.3 million, or 0.40 of total assets as of December 31, 2023. The increase of 27.5 million in nonperforming assets was primarily driven by increases of 22.2 million and 11.8 million in equipment financing and commercial loans, respectively, offset by an 8.0 million decrease in commercial real estate loans during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 The Company evaluates the underlying collateral of each nonaccrual loan and lease and continues to pursue the collection of interest and principal. Management believes that the current level of nonperforming assets remains manageable relative to the size of the Company's loan and lease portfolio. If economic conditions were to worsen or if the marketplace were to experience prolonged economic stress, it is likely that the level of nonperforming assets would increase, as would the level of charged-off loans. 
 Past Due and Accruing 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company had 16.1 million loans and leases greater than 90 days past due and accruing, compared to minimal loans as of December 31, 2023. The increase in 90 days past due and accruing loans was primarily due to one 11.5 million construction relationship, three multi-family relationships totaling 3.4 million, and three commercial real estate relationships totaling 1.3 million becoming 90 days past due.

 Allowance for Credit Losses 
 The ACL consists of general and specific allowances and reflects management's estimate of expected loan and lease losses over the life of the loan or lease. Management uses a consistent and systematic process and methodology to evaluate the adequacy of the ACL on a quarterly basis. Management continuously evaluates and challenges inputs and assumptions in the ACL. 
 While management evaluates currently available information in establishing the ACL, future adjustments to the allowance for loan and lease losses may be necessary if conditions differ substantially from the assumptions used in making the evaluations. Management performs a comprehensive review of the ACL on a quarterly basis. In addition, various regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review a financial institution's ACL and carrying amounts of OREO. Such agencies may require the financial institution to recognize additions or reductions to the allowance based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination. 
 The Company s allowance methodology provides a quantification of estimated losses in the portfolio. Under the current methodology, management estimates losses over the life of the loan using reasonable and supportable forecasts. Forecasts, loan

 data, and model documentation are extensively analyzed and reviewed throughout the quarter to ensure estimated losses are appropriate at quarter end. Qualitative adjustments are applied when model output does not align with management expectations. These adjustments are thoroughly reviewed and documented to provide clarity and a reasonable basis for any deviations from the model. For September 30, 2024, qualitative adjustments were applied to the commercial real estate, commercial, and consumer portfolios resulting in a net addition in total reserves compared to modeled calculations. 
 The following tables present the changes in the allowance for loan and lease losses by portfolio category for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

 At September 30, 2024, the allowance for loan and lease losses increased to 127.3 million, or 1.31 of total loans and leases outstanding. This compared to an allowance for loan and lease losses of 117.5 million, or 1.22 of total loans and leases outstanding, as of December 31, 2023. 
 Net charge-offs in the loans and leases for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 3.8 million and 11.0 million, respectively. As a percentage of average loans and leases, annualized net charge-offs for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 0.16 and 0.47 , respectively. The year over year decrease in the net charge-offs was primarily due to a decrease in net charge-offs of 8.6 million in commercial loans, offset by an increase in net charge-offs of 1.5 million in equipment financing loans.

 Investment Securities 
 The investment portfolio exists primarily for liquidity purposes, and secondarily as a source of interest and dividend income, interest-rate risk management and tax planning as a counterbalance to loan and deposit flows. Investment securities are utilized as part of the Company's asset/liability management and may be sold in response to, or in anticipation of, factors such as changes in market conditions and interest rates, security prepayment rates, deposit outflows, liquidity concentrations and regulatory capital requirements.

 The investment policy of the Company, which is reviewed and approved by the Board of Directors on an annual basis, specifies the types of investments that are acceptable, required investment ratings by at least one nationally recognized rating agency, concentration limits and duration guidelines. Compliance with the investment policy is monitored on a regular basis. In general, the Company seeks to maintain a high degree of liquidity and targets cash, cash equivalents and investment securities available-for-sale balances between 8 and 12 of total assets. 
 Cash, cash equivalents, and investment securities increased 213.7 million, or 27.1 on an annualized basis, to 1.3 billion as of September 30, 2024, from 1.05 billion December 31, 2023. The increase was driven by an increase in cash and due from banks and short-term investments. Cash, cash equivalents, and investment securities were 10.8 of total assets as of September 30, 2024, compared to 9.2 of total assets at December 31, 2023. 
 The following table sets forth certain information regarding the amortized cost and market value of the Company's investment securities at the dates indicated: 
 At September 30, 2024 At December 31, 2023 Amortized Cost Fair Value Amortized Cost Fair Value (In Thousands) Investment securities available-for-sale: GSE debentures 198,129 183,216 220,604 201,127 GSE CMOs 63,498 58,865 66,463 61,617 GSE MBSs 172,586 159,767 186,614 169,997 Municipal obligations 17,353 17,495 18,785 18,922 Corporate debt obligations 12,109 11,666 20,521 19,716 U.S. Treasury bonds 441,801 423,885 470,764 444,737 Foreign government obligations 500 497 500 485 Total investment securities available-for-sale 905,976 855,391 984,251 916,601 
 
 The fair value of investment securities is based principally on market prices and dealer quotes received from third-party, nationally-recognized pricing services for identical investment securities such as U.S. Treasury and agency securities. The Company's marketable equity securities are priced this way and are included in Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy in accordance with the Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures Topic of the FASB, or ASC 820. These prices are validated by comparing the primary pricing source with an alternative pricing source when available. When quoted market prices for identical securities are unavailable, the Company uses market prices provided by independent pricing services based on recent trading activity and other observable information, including but not limited to market interest-rate curves, referenced credit spreads and estimated prepayment speeds where applicable. These investments include certain U.S. and government agency debt securities, municipal and corporate debt securities, GSE residential MBSs and CMOs, all of which are included in Level 2. Certain fair values are estimated using pricing models and are included in Level 3. 
 
 Additionally, management reviews changes in fair value from period to period and performs testing to ensure that prices received from the third parties are consistent with their expectation of the market. Changes in the prices obtained from the pricing service are analyzed from month to month, taking into consideration changes in market conditions including changes in mortgage spreads, changes in U.S. Treasury security yields and changes in generic pricing of 15-year and 30-year securities. Additional analysis may include a review of prices provided by other independent parties, a yield analysis, a review of average life changes using Bloomberg analytics and a review of historical pricing for the particular security. 
 
 Maturities, calls and principal repayments for investment securities available-for-sale totaled 152.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 242.8 million for the same period in 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company did not sell any investment securities available-for-sale, compared to 230.0 million for the same period in 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company purchased 69.9 million of investment securities available-for-sale, compared to 330.8 million for the same period in 2023. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the fair value of all investment securities available-for-sale was 855.4 million with 50.6 million of net unrealized losses, compared to a fair value of 916.6 million and net unrealized losses of 67.7 million as of December 31, 2023. As of September 30, 2024, 565.1 million, or 66.1 , of the portfolio, had gross unrealized losses of 54.0 million. This compares to 717.2 million, or 77.8 , of the portfolio with gross unrealized losses of 69.0 million as of December 31, 2023. The Company's unrealized loss position increased in 2024 primarily driven by increase in current market rates.

 Results of Operations 
 The primary drivers of the Company's net income are net interest income, which is strongly affected by the net yield on and growth of interest-earning assets and liabilities, the quality of the Company's assets, its levels of non-interest income and non-interest expense, and its tax provision. 
 The Company's net interest income represents the difference between interest income earned on its investments, loans and leases, and its cost of funds. Interest income is dependent on the amount of interest-earning assets outstanding during the period and the yield earned thereon. Cost of funds is a function of the average amount of deposits and borrowed money outstanding during the year and the interest rates paid thereon. The net interest margin is calculated by dividing net interest income by average interest-earning assets. Net interest spread is the difference between the average rate earned on interest-earning assets and the average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities. The increases or decreases, as applicable, in the components of interest income and interest expense, expressed in terms of fluctuation in average volume and rate, are summarized under "Rate/Volume Analysis" below. Information as to the components of interest income, interest expense and average rates is provided under "Average Balances, Net Interest Income, Interest-Rate Spread and Net Interest Margin" below. 
 Because the Company's assets and liabilities are not identical in duration and in repricing dates, the differential between the two is vulnerable to changes in market interest rates as well as the overall shape of the yield curve. These vulnerabilities are inherent to the business of banking and are commonly referred to as "interest-rate risk." How interest-rate risk is measured and, once measured, how much interest-rate risk is taken on, are based on numerous assumptions and other subjective judgments. See the discussion in Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk below. 
 The quality of the Company's assets also influences its earnings. Loans and leases that are not paid on a timely basis and exhibit other weaknesses can result in the loss of principal and/or interest income. Additionally, the Company must make timely provisions to the allowance for loan and lease losses based on estimates of probable losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio. These additions, which are charged against earnings, are necessarily greater when greater probable losses are expected. Further, the Company incurs expenses as a result of resolving troubled assets. These variables reflect the "credit risk" that the Company takes on in the ordinary course of business and are further discussed under "Financial Condition Asset Quality" above. 
 
 Net Interest Income 
 Net interest income decreased 1.1 million to 83.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 84.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease reflects a 13.6 million increase in interest expense on deposits and borrowings, which is reflective of the current interest rate environment, along with a 0.3 million decrease in short term investments and restricted equity securities, and a 0.3 million decrease in interest income on debt securities primarily driven by a lower volume during the period, offset by a 13.1 million increase in interest income on loans and leases.

 Net interest income decreased 11.6 million to 244.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 256.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This overall decrease reflects a 57.0 million increase in interest expense on deposit and borrowings and a 4.3 million decrease in interest income on investment securities primarily driven by a lower volume of debt securities during the period, offset by an 49.7 million increase in interest income on loans and leases, which is reflective of the various portfolios repricing and replacing balances into the current interest rate environment.

 The yield on interest-earning assets increased to 5.93 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 5.61 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase is the result of higher yields on loans and leases. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded 1.3 million in prepayment penalties and late charges, which

 contributed 5 basis points to yields on interest-earning assets, compared to 0.8 million, or 3 basis points, for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 The yield on interest-earning assets increased to 5.84 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 5.40 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase is primarily due to higher yields on loans and leases. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded 2.6 million in prepayment penalties and late charges, which contributed 3 basis points to yields on interest-earning assets, compared to 2.2 million in prepayment penalties and late charges, which contributed 3 basis points to yields on interest-earning assets in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 The cost of interest-bearing liabilities increased 51 basis points to 3.67 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 3.16 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The cost of interest-bearing liabilities increased 76 basis points to 3.63 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 2.87 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Refer to "Financial Condition - Borrowed Funds" above for more details. 
 Management aims to position the balance sheet to be neutral to changes in interest rates. As a result of the Federal Reserve's rate cut in September, the Treasury yield curve has become less inverted in recent months, with shorter-term interest rates decreasing. 
 This trend positively impacts the Company's net interest income, net interest spread, and net interest margin. Management anticipates that the net interest margin will increase as deposit and wholesale funding costs decrease more rapidly than loan yields. If the Federal Reserve cuts rates in the near term, the net interest income and the net interest margin will be highly dependent on the Company's ability and timing to reduce deposit pricing. 
 
 Average Balances, Net Interest Income, Interest-Rate Spread and Net Interest Margin 
 The following table sets forth information about the Company's average balances, interest income and interest rates earned on average interest-earning assets, interest expense and interest rates paid on average interest-bearing liabilities, interest-rate spread and net interest margin for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023. Average balances are derived from daily average balances and yields include fees, costs and purchase-accounting-related premiums and discounts which are considered adjustments to coupon yields in accordance with GAAP.

 Rate/Volume Analysis 
 The following table presents, on a tax-equivalent basis, the extent to which changes in interest rates and changes in volume of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities have affected the Company's interest income and interest expense during the periods indicated. Information is provided in each category with respect to: (i) changes attributable to changes in volume (changes in volume multiplied by prior rate), (ii) changes attributable to changes in rate (changes in rate multiplied by prior volume), and (iii) the net change. The changes attributable to the combined impact of volume and rate have been allocated proportionately to the changes due to volume and the changes due to rate.

 Provision for Credit Losses 
 The provisions for credit losses are set forth below: 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Dollar Change Percent Change Nine Months Ended September 30, Dollar Change Percent Change 2024 2023 2024 2023 (Dollars in Thousands) Provision (credit) for loan and lease losses: Commercial real estate (6,971) (5,524) (1,447) 26.2 (1,804) 10,611 (12,415) (117.0) Commercial 16,632 8,829 7,803 88.4 29,511 19,425 10,086 51.9 Consumer (287) 933 (1,220) (130.8) (637) 3,085 (3,722) (120.6) Total provision (credit) for loan and lease losses 9,374 4,238 5,136 121.2 27,070 33,121 (6,051) (18.3) Unfunded credit commitments (4,542) (1,291) (3,251) 251.8 (9,208) 896 (10,104) NM Investment securities available-for-sale (172) 84 (256) N/A (255) 415 (670) N/A Total provision (credit) for credit losses 4,660 3,031 1,629 53.7 17,607 34,432 (16,825) (48.9) 
 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the provision for credit losses increased by 1.6 million to 4.7 million compared to a provision for credit losses of 3.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in the provision for credit losses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 is primarily driven by an increase in specific reserves on nonperforming credits, partially offset by improving economic forecasts. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the provision for credit losses decreased 16.8 million resulting in a provision (credit) for credit and investment losses of 17.6 million. The decrease in the provision for credit losses for nine months ended September 30, 2024 is primarily driven by the lack of day one provision impact resulting from the Company's acquisition of PCSB Bank in 2023.

The increase in effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily driven by nonrecurring items in the 2023 effective rate. The 2023 effective tax rate included energy tax credit deals in 2023 that have not reoccurred in 2024, partially offset by merger expenses relating to the acquisition of PCSB Bank. 
 The Company recorded an income tax expense of 16.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to an income tax expense of 13.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, representing effective tax rates of 24.6 and 20.3 , respectively. The overall increase in the effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 is primarily driven by nonrecurring items in the 2023 effective rate. The 2023 effective tax rate included energy tax credit deals in 2023 that have not reoccurred in 2024 partially offset by merger expenses relating to the acquisition of PCSB Bank in 2023. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 Liquidity 
 Liquidity is defined as the ability to meet current and future financial obligations of a short-term nature. The Company further defines liquidity as the ability to respond to the needs of depositors and borrowers, as well as to earnings enhancement opportunities, in a changing marketplace. Liquidity management is monitored by the Company's ALCO, consisting of members of management, which is responsible for establishing and monitoring liquidity targets as well as strategies and tactics to meet these targets. The primary source of funds for the payment of dividends and expenses by the Company is dividends paid to it by the Banks. The primary sources of liquidity for the Banks consist of deposit inflows, loan repayments, borrowed funds, and maturing investment securities. 
 In the third quarter, the Company operated with increased liquidity. During the year, the Company shifted its balance sheet asset mix to include additional cash and available for sale securities. Management will continue to monitor the economic markets and evaluate changes to the Company s liquidity position. 
 The Company held higher levels of on balance sheet liquidity in the form of cash and available for sale securities in the third quarter. Cash and equivalents at the end of the quarter were 407.9 million, or 3.5 of the balance sheet, compared to 133.0 million, or 1.2 of the balance sheet, as of December 31, 2023. In general, in a normal operating environment, the Company seeks to maintain liquidity levels of cash, cash equivalents and investment securities available-for-sale of between 8 and 12 of total assets. As of September 30, 2024, cash, cash equivalents and investment securities available-for-sale totaled 1.3 billion, or 10.8 of total assets. This compares to 1.0 billion, or 9.2 of total assets, as of December 31, 2023. 
 Deposits, which are considered the most stable source of liquidity, totaled 8.7 billion as of September 30, 2024 and represented 85.4 of total funding (the sum of total deposits and total borrowings), compared to deposits of 8.5 billion, or 86.1 of total funding, as of December 31, 2023. Core deposits, which consist of demand checking, NOW, savings and money market accounts, totaled 6.1 billion as of September 30, 2024 and represented 69.8 of total deposits, compared to core deposits of 6.1 billion, or 71.3 of total deposits, as of December 31, 2023. Additionally, the Company had 815.5 million of brokered deposits as of September 30, 2024, which represented 9.3 of total deposits, compared to 881.2 million or 10.3 of total deposits, as of December 31, 2023. The Company offers attractive interest rates based on market conditions to increase deposits balances, while managing the cost of funds.

 Borrowings are used to diversify the Company's funding mix and to support asset growth. When profitable lending and investment opportunities exist, access to borrowings provides a means to grow the balance sheet. Borrowings totaled 1.5 billion as of September 30, 2024, representing 14.6 of total funding, compared to 1.4 billion, or 13.9 of total funding, as of December 31, 2023. The growth in the balance sheet is driven by the current operating environment, management will continue to monitor economic conditions and make adjustments to the balance sheet mix as appropriate. 
 As members of the FHLB, the Banks have access to both short- and long-term borrowings. As of September 30, 2024, the Company's total borrowing limit from the FHLB for advances and repurchase agreements was 2.7 billion, compared to 2.6 billion as of December 31, 2023. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Banks also have access to funding through certain uncommitted lines via AFX as well as other large financial institution specific lines. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, the Company had no borrowings on outstanding uncommitted lines of credit. 
 The Company had a 30.0 million committed line of credit for contingent liquidity as of September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, the Company did not have any outstanding borrowings on this line. 
 The Company has access to the Federal Reserve Discount Window to supplement its liquidity. The Company had 350.4 million of borrowing capacity at the FRB as of September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, the Company did not have any outstanding borrowings with the FRB. 
 Additionally, the Banks have access to liquidity through repurchase agreements and additional untapped brokered deposits. 
 While management believes the Company has adequate liquidity to meet its commitments and to fund the Banks' lending and investment activities, the availabilities of these funding sources are subject to broad economic conditions and could be restricted in the future. Such restrictions would impact the Company's immediate liquidity and/or additional liquidity needs. 
 
 Off-Balance-Sheet Financial Instruments 
 
 The Company is party to off-balance-sheet financial instruments in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers and to reduce its own exposure to fluctuations in interest rates. These financial instruments include loan commitments, standby and commercial letters of credit and interest-rate swaps. According to GAAP, these financial instruments are not recorded in the financial statements until they are funded or related fees are incurred or received. See Note 12, "Commitments and Contingencies", to the consolidated financial statements for a description of off-balance-sheet financial instruments.

 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
 Market Risk 
 Market risk is the risk that the market value or estimated fair value of the Company's assets, liabilities, and derivative financial instruments will decline as a result of changes in interest rates or financial market volatility, or that the Company's net income will be significantly reduced by interest-rate changes. 
 Interest-Rate Risk 
 The principal market risk facing the Company is interest-rate risk, which can occur in a variety of forms, including repricing risk, yield-curve risk, basis risk, and prepayment risk. Repricing risk occurs when the change in the average yield of either interest-earning assets or interest-bearing liabilities is more sensitive than the other to changes in market interest rates. Such a change in sensitivity could reflect a number of possible mismatches in the repricing opportunities of the Company's assets and liabilities. Yield-curve risk reflects the possibility that changes in the shape of the yield curve could have different effects on the Company's assets and liabilities. Basis risk occurs when different parts of the balance sheet are subject to varying base rates reflecting the possibility that the spread from those base rates will deviate. Prepayment risk is associated with financial instruments with an option to prepay before the stated maturity, often a disadvantage to person selling the option; this risk is most often associated with the prepayment of loans, callable investments, and callable borrowings. 
 Asset/Liability Management 
 Market risk and interest-rate risk management is governed by the Company's ALCO. The ALCO establishes exposure limits that define the Company's tolerance for interest-rate risk. The ALCO and the Company's Treasury Group measure and manage the composition of the balance sheet over a range of possible changes in interest rates while remaining responsive to market demand for loan and deposit products. The ALCO monitors current exposures versus limits and reports those results to the Board of Directors. The policy limits and guidelines serve as benchmarks for measuring interest-rate risk and for providing a framework for evaluation and interest-rate risk-management decision-making. The Company measures its interest-rate risk by using an asset/liability simulation model. The model considers several factors to determine the Company's potential exposure to interest-rate risk, including measurement of repricing gaps, duration, convexity, value-at-risk, market value of portfolio equity under assumed changes in the level of interest rates, the shape of yield curves, and general market volatility. 
 Management controls the Company's interest-rate exposure using several strategies, which include adjusting the maturities of securities in the Company's investment portfolio, limiting or expanding the terms of loans originated, limiting fixed-rate customer deposits with terms of more than five years, and adjusting maturities of wholesale funding. The Company limits this risk by restricting the types of MBSs it invests into those with limited average life changes under certain interest-rate-shock scenarios, or securities with embedded prepayment penalties. The Company also places limits on holdings of fixed-rate mortgage loans with maturities greater than five years. The Company enters into interest rate swaps as part of its interest rate risk management strategy. These interest rate swaps are designated as cash flow hedges and involve the receipt of variable rate amounts from a counterparty in exchange for the Company making fixed payments. 
 Measuring Interest-Rate Risk 
 As noted above, interest-rate risk can be measured by analyzing the extent to which the repricing of assets and liabilities are mismatched to create an interest-rate sensitivity gap. An asset or liability is said to be interest-rate sensitive within a specific period if it will mature or reprice within that period. The interest-rate sensitivity gap is defined as the difference between the amount of interest-earning assets maturing or repricing within a specific time period and the amount of interest-bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within that same time period. A gap is considered positive when the amount of interest-rate-sensitive assets exceeds the amount of interest-rate-sensitive liabilities. A gap is considered negative when the amount of interest-rate-sensitive liabilities exceeds the amount of interest-rate-sensitive assets. During a period of falling interest rates, a positive gap would tend to adversely affect net interest income. Conversely, during a period of rising interest rates, a positive gap position would tend to result in an increase in net interest income. 
 The Company's interest-rate risk position is measured using both income simulation and interest-rate sensitivity "gap" analysis. Income simulation is the primary tool for measuring the interest-rate risk inherent in the Company's balance sheet at a given point in time by showing the effect on net interest income, over a twelve-month period, of a variety of interest-rate shocks. These simulations take into account repricing, maturity, and prepayment characteristics of individual products. The ALCO reviews simulation results to determine whether exposure resulting from changes in market interest rates remains within established tolerance levels over a twelve-month horizon, and develops appropriate strategies to manage this exposure. The Company's interest-rate risk analysis remains modestly asset-sensitive as of September 30, 2024.

 The assumptions used in the Company s interest-rate sensitivity simulation discussed above are inherently uncertain and, as a result, the simulations cannot precisely measure net interest income or precisely predict the impact of changes in interest rates. 
 As of September 30, 2024, net interest income simulation indicated that the Company's exposure to changing interest rates was within tolerance. The ALCO reviews the methodology utilized for calculating interest-rate risk exposure and may periodically adopt modifications to this methodology. The following table presents the estimated impact of interest-rate changes on the Company's estimated net interest income over the twelve-month periods indicated while maintaining a flat balance sheet: 
 Estimated Exposure to Net Interest Income over Twelve-Month Horizon Beginning September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Change in Interest Rate Levels Dollar Change Percent Change Dollar Change Percent Change (Dollars in Thousands) Up 300 basis points shock 16,867 4.7 13,318 3.9 Up 200 basis points ramp 9,155 2.6 7,068 2.1 Up 100 basis points ramp 5,123 1.4 3,389 1.0 Down 100 basis points ramp (3,691) (1.0) (5,042) (1.5) 
 The estimated impact of a 300 basis point increase in market interest rates on the Company's estimated net interest income over a twelve-month horizon was 4.7 as of September 30, 2024, compared to 3.9 as of December 31, 2023. 
 The Company also utilizes interest-rate sensitivity "gap" analysis to provide a broader overview of its interest-rate risk profile. The interest-rate sensitivity gap is defined as the difference between interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within a given time period. As of September 30, 2024, the Company s one-year cumulative gap was a negative 973.7 million, or 8.90 of total interest-earning assets, compared to a negative 521.4 million, or 4.89 of total interest-earning assets, as of December 31, 2023. 
 The assumptions used in the Company's interest-rate sensitivity simulation discussed above are inherently uncertain and, as a result, the simulations cannot precisely measure net interest income or precisely predict the impact of changes in interest rates. For additional discussion on interest-rate risk see Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk of the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. 
 The EVE at Risk Simulation is conducted in tandem with net interest income simulations to ascertain a longer term view of the Company s interest-rate risk position by capturing longer-term repricing risk and options risk embedded in the balance sheet. It measures the sensitivity of the economic value of equity to changes in interest rates. The EVE at Risk Simulation values only the current balance sheet and does not incorporate growth assumptions. As with the net interest income simulation, this simulation captures product characteristics such as loan resets, repricing terms, maturity dates, and rate caps and floors. Key assumptions include loan prepayment speeds, deposit pricing elasticity, and non-maturity deposit attrition rates. These assumptions can have significant impacts on valuation results as the assumptions remain in effect for the entire life of each asset and liability. The Company conducts non-maturity deposit behavior studies on a periodic basis to support deposit assumptions used in the valuation process. All key assumptions are subject to a periodic review. 
 EVE at Risk is calculated by estimating the net present value of all future cash flows from existing assets and liabilities using current interest rates as well as parallel shocks to the current interest-rate environment. The following table sets forth the estimated percentage change in the Company s EVE at Risk, assuming various shifts in interest rates. 
 Estimated Percent Change in Economic Value of Equity Parallel Shock in Interest Rate Levels At September 30, 2024 At December 31, 2023 Up 300 basis points (3.6) (6.3) Up 200 basis points (3.0) (4.4) Up 100 basis points (0.6) (2.2) Down 100 basis points (1.2) 2.1 
 
 The Company's EVE-at-risk asset sensitivity decreased from December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024 driven by deposit mix and loan growth.

 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 
 Controls and Procedures 
 
 Under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s management, including the Company s Chief Executive Officer (Principal Executive Officer) and Chief Financial Officer (Principal Financial Officer), the Company has evaluated the effectiveness of its disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer considered that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that the Company files or submits under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including its Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 
 The Company s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a -15(f). The Company s internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance to its management and the Board of Directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements. All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. The Company s management assessed the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting as of the end of the period covered by this report. There has been no change in the Company s internal controls over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that has materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 
 Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting as of December 31, 2023 and the related Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm thereon appear on pages F-1 and F-2 of the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.
