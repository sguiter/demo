and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 respectively, compared to and for the same periods in 2023. Recognition of interest income and rental revenue is suspended (put on non-accrual status) when the receivable becomes more than 90 days past the contractual due date or earlier if some other event causes the Company to determine that collection is not probable. Accordingly, finance receivables more than 90 days past due were accruing interest at September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023. Recognition is resumed if the receivable becomes current by the payment of all amounts due under the terms of the existing contract and collection of remaining amounts is considered probable (if not contractually modified) or if the customer makes scheduled payments for three months and collection of remaining amounts is considered probable (if contractually modified). Payments received while the finance receivable is on non-accrual status are applied to interest and principal in accordance with the contractual terms. in 2024 and in 2023, and did not have a significant effect on the weighted average term or interest rate of the total portfolio at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The Company has developed a systematic methodology for determining the allowance for credit losses for its portfolio segments, retail and wholesale. The retail segment consists of retail loans and sales-type finance leases, net of unearned interest. The wholesale segment consists of truck inventory financing loans to dealers that are collateralized by trucks and other collateral. The wholesale segment generally has less risk than the retail segment. Wholesale receivables generally are shorter in duration than retail receivables, and the Company requires periodic reporting of the wholesale dealer s financial condition, conducts periodic audits of the trucks being financed and, in many cases, obtains guarantees or other security such as dealership assets. In determining the allowance for credit losses, retail loans and finance leases are evaluated together since they relate to a similar customer base, their contractual terms require regular payment of principal and interest, generally over to , and they are secured by the same type of collateral. The allowance for credit losses consists of both specific and general reserves. The Company individually evaluates certain finance receivables for expected credit losses. Finance receivables that are evaluated individually consist of all wholesale accounts and certain large retail accounts with past due balances or otherwise determined to be at a higher risk of loss. In general, finance receivables that are 90 days past due are placed on non-accrual status. Finance receivables on non-accrual status which have been performing for 90 consecutive days are placed on accrual status if it is deemed probable that the Company will collect all principal and interest payments. Individually evaluated receivables on non-accrual status are generally considered collateral dependent. Large balance retail and all wholesale receivables on non-accrual status are individually evaluated to determine the appropriate reserve for losses. Generally, the determination of reserves for large balance receivables on non-accrual status considers the fair value of the associated collateral. When the underlying collateral fair value exceeds the Company s amortized cost basis, no reserve is recorded. Small balance receivables on non-accrual status with similar risk characteristics are evaluated as a separate pool to determine the appropriate reserve for losses using the historical loss information discussed below.

For the following credit quality disclosures, finance receivables are classified into portfolio segments, wholesale and retail. The retail portfolio is further segmented into dealer retail and customer retail. The dealer wholesale segment consists of truck inventory financing to PACCAR dealers. The dealer retail segment consists of loans and leases to participating dealers and franchises that use the proceeds to fund customers acquisition of commercial vehicles and related equipment. The customer retail segment consists of loans and leases directly to customers for the acquisition of commercial vehicles and related equipment. Customer retail receivables are further segregated between fleet and owner/operator classes. The fleet class consists of customer retail accounts operating five or more trucks. All other customer retail accounts are considered owner/operator. These two classes have similar measurement attributes, risk characteristics and common methods to monitor and assess credit risk.

Credit Quality The Company's customers are principally concentrated in the transportation industry in the United States. The Company s portfolio assets are diversified over a large number of customers and dealers with no single customer or dealer balances representing over of the total portfolio assets as of September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023. The Company retains as collateral a security interest in the related equipment. At the inception of each contract, the Company considers the credit risk based on a variety of credit quality factors including prior payment experience, customer financial information, credit-rating agency ratings, loan-to-value ratios and other internal metrics. On an ongoing basis, the Company monitors credit quality based on past due status and collection experience as there is a meaningful correlation between the past due status of customers and the risk of loss. The Company has three credit quality indicators: performing, watch and at-risk. Performing accounts pay in accordance with the contractual terms and are not considered high-risk. Watch accounts include accounts 31 to 90 days past due and large accounts that are performing but are considered to be high-risk. Watch accounts are not collateral dependent. At-risk accounts are generally collateral dependent, including accounts over 90 days past due and other accounts on non-accrual status.

Customers Experiencing Financial Difficulty The Company modified and of finance receivables for customers experiencing financial difficulty during the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, respectively. The modifications provided term extensions and granted customers additional time to pay. Other than insignificant term extensions to fleet customers in financial difficulty were for the three months ended September 30, 2024, or an insignificant percent of the retail portfolio, and added a weighted-average of six months to the life of the modified contracts. Other than insignificant term extensions to fleet customers in financial difficulty were for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, or of the retail portfolio, and added a weighted-average of six months to the life of the modified contracts. The Company provided only insignificant term extensions for the same periods in 2023. The effect on the allowance for credit losses from such modifications was t significant for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. There were and finance receivables modified with customers experiencing financial difficulty during the previous twelve months that had a payment default in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively.

The Support Agreement also requires PACCAR to own, directly or indirectly, all outstanding voting stock of the Company. Periodically, the Company makes loans to, borrows from and has intercompany transactions with PACCAR. In addition, the Company periodically loans funds to certain foreign finance and leasing affiliates of PACCAR. These affiliates have Support Agreements with PACCAR, similar to the Company s Support Agreement with PACCAR. The foreign affiliates operate in the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Mexico, Canada and Australia. Loans to these foreign affiliates during 2024 and 2023 were denominated in United States dollars. The foreign affiliates primarily provide financing and leasing of PACCAR manufactured trucks and related equipment sold through the DAF, Kenworth and Peterbilt independent dealer networks in Europe, Mexico, Canada and Australia. The Company will not make loans to the foreign affiliates in excess of the equivalent of U.S. dollars, unless the amount in excess of such limit is guaranteed by PACCAR. The Company periodically reviews the funding alternatives for these affiliates, and these limits may be revised in the future.

Used trucks held for sale 

Derivative contracts

Derivative contracts 

The Company uses the following methods and assumptions to measure fair value for assets and liabilities subject to non-recurring and recurring fair value measurements: Impaired Loans: Impaired loans that are individually evaluated are generally considered collateral dependent. Accordingly, the evaluation of individual reserves on such loans considers the fair value of the associated collateral (estimated sales proceeds less the costs to sell). Used Trucks Held for Sale: The carrying amount of used trucks held for sale is written down as necessary to reflect the fair value less costs to sell. The Company determines the fair value of used trucks from a pricing matrix, which is based on the market approach. The significant observable inputs into the valuation model are recent sales prices of comparable units sold individually, which is the lowest unit of account, and the condition of the vehicles. Used truck impairments related to units held at September 30, 2024 and 2023 were and during the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, respectively. These assets, which are shown in the above table when they are written down to fair value less costs to sell, are categorized as Level 2 and are included in Other assets on the Balance Sheets. Derivative Financial Instruments: The Company s derivative financial instruments consist of interest-rate swaps and are carried at fair value. These derivative contracts are traded over the counter and their fair value is determined using industry standard valuation models, which are based on the income approach (i.e., discounted cash flows). The significant observable inputs into the valuation models include interest rates, yield curves and credit default swap spreads. These contracts are categorized as Level 2 and are included in Other assets and Accounts payable, accrued expenses and other on the Balance Sheets. Fair Value Disclosure of Other Financial Instruments For financial instruments that are not recognized at fair value, the Company uses the following methods and assumptions to determine the fair value. These instruments are categorized as Level 2, except cash which is categorized as Level 1 and fixed rate loans which are categorized as Level 3. Cash: Carrying amounts approximate fair value. Net Receivables: For floating rate loans, dealer wholesale financing and operating lease and other trade receivables, carrying values approximate fair values. For fixed rate loans, fair values are estimated using the income approach by discounting cash flows to their present value based on assumptions regarding credit and liquidity risks to approximate current rates for comparable loans. Finance lease receivables and related allowance for credit losses have been excluded from the accompanying table.

at September 30, 2024. The Company assesses hedges at inception and on an ongoing basis to determine if the designated derivatives are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of the hedged items. Hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively when the Company determines that a derivative financial instrument has ceased to be a highly effective hedge. Cash flows from derivative instruments are included in operating activities in the Statements of Cash Flows. Interest-rate contracts involve the exchange of fixed for floating rate or floating for fixed rate interest payments based on the contractual notional amounts in a single currency. The Company is exposed to interest-rate risk caused by market volatility as a result of its borrowing activities. The objective of these contracts is to mitigate the fluctuations on earnings, cash flows and fair value of borrowings. Net amounts paid or received are reflected as adjustments to interest expense. At September 30, 2024, the notional amount of these contracts totaled with amounts expiring over the next years. Notional maturities for all interest-rate contracts are for the remainder of 2024, for 2025, for 2026, for 2027, for 2028 and thereafter.

Amounts in AOCI are reclassified into net income in the same period in which the hedged transaction affects earnings and are presented in the same income statement line as the earnings effect of the hedged transaction. The amount of gain recorded in AOCI at September 30, 2024 that is estimated to be reclassified to interest expense in the following 12 months if interest rates remain unchanged is approximately , net of taxes. The fixed interest earned on finance receivables will offset the amount recognized in interest expense, resulting in a stable interest margin consistent with the Company s interest-rate risk management strategy. Fair Value Hedges Changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as fair value hedges are recorded in earnings together with the changes in fair value of the hedged item attributable to the risk being hedged.

New business volume from retail loans and finance leases in the third quarter of 2024 increased to 893.4 from 788.5 in the third quarter of 2023, and in the first nine months of 2024, increased to 2,320.3 from 2,132.6 in the same period of 2023, primarily due to higher retail sales of PACCAR trucks, higher finance market share and a higher amount financed per truck in 2024. Equipment on operating leases new business volume increased to 43.8 and 222.0 in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, from 22.0 and 67.6 in the third quarter and first nine months of 2023, respectively, primarily driven by increased demand from one large fleet customer.

 Income Before Income Taxes 
 The Company s income before income taxes was 37.8 for the third quarter of 2024 compared to 42.5 for the third quarter of 2023. The decrease in income before income taxes in 2024 was primarily the result of a higher provision for losses of 9.1 and lower operating lease margin of 5.6, partially offset by higher finance margin of 12.3. 
 The Company s income before income taxes was 115.9 for the first nine months of 2024 compared to 148.3 for the first nine months of 2023. The decrease in income before income taxes in 2024 was primarily the result of lower operating lease margin, reflecting lower results from returned lease assets, and a higher provision for losses of 20.9, partially offset by higher finance margin of 37.3. 
 Included in Other assets on the Company s Balance Sheets are used trucks held for sale, net of impairments, of 121.8 at September 30, 2024 and 145.5 at December 31, 2023.

The provision for losses on receivables was 23.1 for the first nine months of 2024 compared to 2.2 for the first nine months of 2023, primarily due to higher charge-offs, portfolio growth and higher past due balances in 2024. 
 
 Charge-offs, net of recoveries, were 14.9 in the first nine months of 2024 compared to 2.9 in the first nine months of 2023 due to higher credit losses in 2024, including one large fleet customer, as well as higher average loss severity from lower used truck market values. 
 
 Retail loan and lease receivables past due over 30 days at September 30, 2024 was 1.06 , compared to .88 at December 31, 2023 and .41 at September 30, 2023. The increase from September 30, 2023 was primarily due to four large fleet customers becoming past due. The Company continues to focus on maintaining low past due balances. 
 
 The estimation methods and factors considered for determining the allowance during the periods included in this filing have been consistently applied. See Note B Finance and Other Receivables for additional discussion regarding the Allowance for Credit Losses. 
 Modifications 
 The Company modifies loans and finance leases in the normal course of its operations. The Company may modify loans and finance leases for commercial reasons or for credit reasons. Modifications for commercial reasons are changes to contract terms for customers that are not considered to be in financial difficulty. Insignificant delays are modifications extending terms up to three months for customers experiencing some short-term financial stress, but not considered to be in financial difficulty. Modifications for credit reasons are changes to contract terms for customers considered to be in financial difficulty. The Company s modifications typically result in granting more time to pay the contractual amounts owed and charging a fee and interest for the term of the modification. When considering whether to modify customer accounts for credit reasons, the Company evaluates the creditworthiness of the customers and modifies those accounts that the Company considers likely to perform under the modified terms.

Amortized cost basis immediately after modification as a percentage of period-end portfolio, on an annualized basis. 
 Modification activity increased to 491.4 in the first nine months of 2024 from 167.1 in the first nine months of 2023. The increase in Commercial modifications primarily reflects higher volumes of end-of-term refinancing. The increase in Insignificant Delay modifications reflects an increase in customers requesting payment relief for up to three months. The increase in Credit modifications is primarily due to two large fleet customers that were granted a weighted average of five months term extension. These customers were not past due at the time of modification and at September 30, 2024. 
 When the Company modifies a 30+ days past due account, the customer is then generally considered current under the revised contractual terms. The Company modified 1.7 of accounts during the third quarter of 2024, 2.7 of accounts during the fourth quarter of 2023 and .3 of accounts in the third quarter of 2023 that were 30+ days past due and became current at the time of modification. Had the accounts not been modified and had they continued to not make payments, the pro forma percentage of retail loan and lease accounts 30+ days past due would have been as follows:

The effect on the allowance for credit losses from such modifications was not significant at September 30, 2024, December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2023. 
 Portfolio 
 The Company s portfolio is concentrated with customers in the heavy- and medium-duty truck transportation industry. The portfolio is comprised of retail loans and leases, dealer wholesale financing and dealer master notes as follows:

PACCAR FINANCIAL CORP. 

 Dealer master notes were 467.2 at September 30, 2024 compared to 509.2 at December 31, 2023. Dealers may pay the loans early or make additional draws up to specified balances of the contracts and/or vehicles pledged to the Company. As of September 30, 2024, the underlying pledged contracts and/or vehicles were 631.8, of which the dealers have 159.9 as potential additional borrowing capacity. 
 Income Taxes 
 The Company s effective income tax rate for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 was 24.6 and 24.3 , respectively, compared to 24.2 and 24.7 for the same periods of 2023, reflecting changes in the state tax expense during 2024 as compared to 2023. 
 The Company is included in the consolidated federal income tax return of PACCAR. Federal income taxes for the Company are determined on a separate return basis. State income taxes, where the Company files combined tax returns with PACCAR, are determined on a blended statutory rate, which is substantially the same as the rate computed on a separate return basis. 
 The Company's deferred income tax benefit for the first nine months of 2024 was 17.9 compared to a deferred income tax provision of 13.4 for the first nine months of 2023. The Company's net deferred tax liability decreased to 456.9 at September 30, 2024 from 476.3 at December 31, 2023, primarily due to lower benefits from accelerated depreciation. Deferred taxes are impacted by new business volume and the accelerated depreciation deduction rate under U.S. federal and state tax law. The difference in the timing of depreciation for financial statement and income tax purposes does not impact operating results and is not expected to have a significant impact on liquidity in 2024. 
 Company Outlook 
 Truck Industry Class 8 retail sales in the U.S. in 2024 are expected to be 220,000-240,000 units compared to 266,800 in 2023. Average earning assets in 2024 are expected to increase 17-19 compared to 2023 due to strong new business volume and dealer wholesale financing. Current high levels of freight tonnage, freight rates and fleet utilization are contributing to customers profitability and cash flow. If current freight transportation conditions decline due to weaker economic conditions, then past due accounts, truck repossessions and credit losses would likely increase from the current low levels and new business volume would likely decline. See the Forward-Looking Statements section of Management s Discussion and Analysis for factors that may affect this outlook. 
 Funding and Liquidity 
 The Company s debt ratings at September 30, 2024 are as follows: 

Standard 

and Poor's 
 
 Moody's 

Commercial paper 
 
 A-1 
 
 P-1 

Senior unsecured debt 
 
 A+ 
 
 A1 

A decrease in these credit ratings could negatively impact the Company s ability to access capital markets at competitive interest rates and the Company s ability to maintain liquidity and financial stability. 
 The Company periodically registers debt securities under the Securities Act of 1933 for offering to the public. In November 2021, the Company filed a shelf registration statement to issue medium-term notes. The shelf registration statement expires in November 2024 and does not limit the principal amount of debt securities that may be issued during the period. The Company intends to file a new shelf registration in November. 
 The Company participates with PACCAR and certain other PACCAR affiliates in committed bank facilities of 4,000.0 at September 30, 2024. Of these committed bank facilities, 1,500.0 expires in June 2025, 1,250.0 expires in June 2027 and 1,250.0 expires in June 2029. PACCAR and the Company intend to extend or replace these credit facilities on or before expiration. This extension or replacement could include similar borrowing capacity or upsizing the facility. 
 Of the 4,000.0 credit facilities, 3,088.0 is available for use by the Company and/or PACCAR and other non-U.S. PACCAR financial subsidiaries. The remaining 912.0 is allocated to PACCAR and other non-U.S. PACCAR financial subsidiaries. These credit facilities are maintained primarily to provide backup liquidity for the Company s commercial paper and maturing medium-term

 notes. The Company is liable only for its own borrowings under these credit facilities. There were no borrowings under these credit facilities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 The Company issues commercial paper and medium-term notes to fund its financing and leasing operations. The total principal amounts of commercial paper and medium-term notes outstanding for the Company as of September 30, 2024 were 2,935.0 and 7,150.0, respectively. 
 The Company believes its current investment grade credit ratings of A+/A1, committed bank facilities, collections on existing loans and leases and its ability to borrow from PACCAR, if necessary, will continue to provide it with sufficient resources and access to capital markets at competitive interest rates to maintain its liquidity and financial stability. In the event of a decrease in the Company s credit ratings or a disruption in the financial markets, the Company may not be able to refinance its maturing debt in the financial markets. In such circumstances, the Company would be exposed to liquidity risk to the degree that the timing of debt maturities differs from the timing of receivable collections from customers. The Company believes its various sources of liquidity, including committed bank facilities, would continue to provide it with sufficient funding resources to service its maturing debt obligations. 
 Other information on liquidity, sources of capital, and contractual cash commitments as presented in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 (the 2023 Annual Report continues to be relevant.
