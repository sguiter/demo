 million and reported net cash used in operations of million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The Company expects operating losses to continue in the foreseeable future because of additional costs and expenses related to research and development activities, plans to expand its product portfolio, and increase its market share. The Company s ability to attain profitable operations is dependent upon achieving a level of revenues adequate to support its cost structure. Based on current operating levels, the Company will need to raise additional funds in the next 12 months by selling additional equity or incurring debt. To date, the Company has funded its operations primarily through sales of its securities in public and private markets, proceeds from the exercise of warrants to purchase common stock and the sale of convertible notes. Additionally, future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including the rate of revenue growth, the selling price of the Company s products, the expansion of sales and marketing activities, the timing and extent of spending on research and development efforts and the continuing market acceptance of the Company s products. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern for the twelve months from the date of this Report. Management of the Company intends to raise additional funds through the issuance of equity securities or debt. There can be no assurance that, in the event the Company requires additional financing, such financing will be available at terms acceptable to the Company, if at all. Failure to generate sufficient cash flows from operations, raise additional capital and reduce discretionary spending could have a material adverse effect on the Company s ability to achieve its intended business objectives. As a result, the substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern has not been alleviated. The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.

The Company s effective tax rate was for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. The Company s effective tax rate was for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The difference between the effective tax rate and the federal statutory tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 2023 primarily relates to the valuation allowance on the Company s deferred tax assets. For interim periods, the Company estimates its annual effective income tax rate and applies the estimated rate to the year-to-date income or loss before income taxes. The Company also computes the tax provision or benefit related to items reported separately and recognizes the items net of their related tax effect in the interim periods in which they occur. The Company also recognizes the effect of changes in enacted tax laws or rates in the interim periods in which the changes occur. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company retains a full valuation allowance on its deferred tax assets. The realization of the Company s deferred tax assets depends primarily on its ability to generate taxable income in future periods. The amount of deferred tax assets considered realizable in future periods may change as management continues to reassess the underlying factors it uses in estimating future taxable income. The provision for income taxes for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was calculated on a jurisdiction basis.

 Item 4. Controls and Procedures. Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that material information required to be disclosed in our periodic reports filed under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC rules and forms and to ensure that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on the foregoing evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer (Principal Executive Officer) and Chief Financial Officer (Principal Financial Officer), does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within our Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include, but are not limited to, the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the control. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Changes in Internal Controls There were no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the three months ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.
