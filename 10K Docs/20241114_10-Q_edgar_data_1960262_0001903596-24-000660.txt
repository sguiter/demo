The Company has cash
on hand of at
September 30, 2024. The Company does not expect to generate sufficient revenues and positive cash flows from operations to meet its current
obligations. However, the Company may seek to raise debt or equity-based capital at favorable terms, though such terms are not certain. 

These factors create
substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern within the twelve-month period subsequent to the date
that these financial statements are issued. 

The consolidated
financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.
Accordingly, the financial statements have been prepared on a basis that assumes the Company will continue as a going concern and which
contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities and commitments in the ordinary course of business. 

Management s
strategic plans include the following: 

Execute
 business operations more fully during the year ended December 31, 2024, 

Seek
 out strategic acquisitions of health care technology; and 

Explore
 prospective partnership opportunities 

The determination
of fair value and the assessment of a measurement s placement within the hierarchy requires judgment. Level 3 valuations often
involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity. Level 3 valuations may require the use of various cost, market, or income valuation
methodologies applied to unobservable management estimates and assumptions. Management s assumptions could vary depending on the
asset or liability valued and the valuation method used. Such assumptions could include estimates of prices, earnings, costs, actions
of market participants, market factors, or the weighting of various valuation methods. The Company may also engage external advisors
to assist us in determining fair value, as appropriate. 

Although the Company
believes that the recorded fair value of our financial instruments is appropriate, these fair values may not be indicative of net realizable
value or reflective of future fair values. 

The Company s
financial instruments are carried at historical cost. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, the carrying amounts
of these instruments approximated their fair values because of the short-term nature of these instruments. 

ASC 825-10 Financial
Instruments allows entities to voluntarily choose to measure certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value fair
value option ). The fair value option may be elected on an instrument-by-instrument basis and is irrevocable unless a new election
date occurs. If the fair value option is elected for an instrument, unrealized gains and losses for that instrument should be reported
in earnings at each subsequent reporting date. The Company did not elect to apply the fair value option to any outstanding financial
instruments.

Preferred Stock 

In May 2022 and December
2022, the Company s Articles of Incorporation, as amended, authorized the issuance of shares of preferred stock
which may be amended from time to time in one or more series. The Board of Directors is authorized to determine, prior to issuing any
such series of preferred stock and without any vote or action by the shareholders, the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions
of the shares of such series, including dividend rights, voting rights, terms of redemption, the provisions of any purchase, retirement
or sinking fund to be provided for the shares of any series, conversion and exchange rights, the preferences upon any distribution of
the assets of the Company, including in the event of voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company,
and the preferences and relative rights among each series of preferred stock. 

The Board of Directors
has made the following designations of its preferred stock.

provision.

the Company, along with approval from its convertible preferred stockholders agreed to remove provisions related to mandatory redemption

Current
Financial Condition Summary 

We
had a net loss of 2,861,013 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Additionally, we had net cash used in operating activities
of 523,983 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. At September 30, 2024, we had a working capital deficit of 2,329,074,
an accumulated deficit of 7,103,495 and a stockholders deficit of 2,329,074, which could have a material impact on our ability
to obtain needed capital. 

20 

Results
of Operations 

Nine
months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 . For the nine months ended September 30,
2024 and 2023, we had revenue from services of 13,254 and 0, respectively. We expect that revenues from sales of our planned products
will begin during the first quarter of 2025, assuming we are able to obtain needed funding of approximately 1,500,000, of which there
is no assurance. 

Operating
Expenses . Total operating expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, were 1,245,751 and 1,274,036 respectively.
The decrease in operating expenses during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was primarily due to a significant decrease in our
activities relating to research and development, as well as the reduction in payments of monthly fees to our key consultants and fees
for professional services, including accounting and legal. 

General
and Administrative Expenses . The increase of 113,832 in general and administrative expenses for the nine months ended September
30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, was primarily due to the decrease in our payments of monthly fees
to our key consultants and fees for professional services, including accounting and legal. 

Research
and Development . The 286,591 and 428,708 in research and development expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024
and 2023, respectively, were incurred due to our determining to make expenditures in the development of our planned products, including
the payment of product study-relate expenses. While we expect to continue to incur research and development expenses, we are unable to
predict the level of such expenditures, due to the uncertainty of the level of funding that will be available to us. 

Other
Income/Expense . Total other expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, were 1,628,516 and 732,706, respectively.
The increase in total other expense during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was primarily due to an increase in inducement expense
associated with our extending notes payable that had reached maturity, an issuance of warrants as a financing expense and an increase
in interest expense. The increases were offset by a decrease in amortization of debt discount. 

Amortization
of Debt Discount . During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we incurred 15,000 in amortization of debt discount for OID
and guaranteed interest on a convertible note payable. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we incurred amortization of debt
discount expense of 434,514. We are unable to predict with any certainty our amortization of debt discount expense for all of 2024. 

Interest
Expense . Interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was higher than for the nine months ended September 30,
2023, 38,612 versus 9,175. We anticipate that our interest expense for all of 2024 will be higher but are unable to make any prediction
in this regard. 

Net
Loss . We incurred a net loss of 2,861,013 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to a net loss of 2,006,742
for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in net loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the
nine months ended September 30, 2023, was primarily due to an increase interest expense, stock-based inducement and financing expenses
of 1,613,516, by a decrease of 28,285 in operating expenses, a decrease of 419,514 in amortization of debt discount and an increase
in interest expense of 29,437. Should we be able to obtain needed capital, as we continue to expand our business activities, we expect
that our operating expenses for all of 2024 will be in excess of those incurred during the year ended December 31, 2023. However, we
are unable to predict our actual operating expenses for all of 2024, due to the uncertainty surrounding our ability to obtain capital. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

September
30, 2024 . At September30, 2024, the Company had 43,352 in cash and a working capital deficit of 2,329,074 compared to 108,335
in cash and a working capital deficit of 1,461,565 at December 31, 2023. The Company has sufficient working capital to fund current
operating expenses at least through the third quarter of 2024. To the extent the Company requires additional funds beyond such time,
we will need to obtain additional debt or equity-based capital from third parties to implement our full business plans. There is no assurance
that we will be successful in obtaining such additional capital. 

Cash
Flows 

Net
Cash Used in Operating Activities . Net cash used in operating activities was 523,983 during the nine months ended September
30, 2024, compared to 320,700 used during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

21 

Net
Cash Used in Investing Activities . Net cash used in investing activities was -0- during the nine months ended September 30,
2024, compared to -0- during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

Net
Cash Provided by Financing Activities . Net cash provided by financing activities was 459,000 of net cash during the nine months
ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 70,000 provided during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. All of the cash provided by
financing activities was proceeds from convertible promissory notes issued and an advance. 

Notes
Payable and Convertible Promissory Notes 

In February, 2024, the Company
entered into a securities purchase agreement (the SPA ), pursuant to which the Company agreed to issue to the Investor a
Promissory Note (the Note ), dated February 12, 2024, in the principal amount of 50,000. The Note was funded by the Investor
on February 15, 2024, with the Company receiving funding of 40,000, net of OID of 15,000, including guaranteed interest of 10 per calendar
year, or 5,000. The Note matures on May 12, 2024. In July, 2024 the Company extended the maturity on the note to October 1, 2024. In
consideration thereof, the noteholder received a warrant to purchase 2 shares of the Company s common stock for each 1 of indebtedness
they held, at an exercise price of 0.30 per share and an expiration date of July 16, 2026. The shares underlying each warrant are to
be included in the Company s next-filed registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Form S-1. Only upon
an event of default that shall not have been cured, the Note is convertible into shares of the Company s common stock at any time
at a conversion price equal to the lowest traded price of the Common Stock during the thirty (30) business days prior to the relevant
notice of conversion; provided, however, that the Investor may not convert the Note to the extent that such conversion would result in
the investor s beneficial ownership of the Company s common stock being in excess of 9.99 of the Company s then-issued
and outstanding common stock. 

Between March 2024 and August, 2024, the Company entered
into securities purchase agreements (the SPAs with 13 individuals, pursuant to which the Company agreed to issue to the
Investors Promissory Notes (the Notes ), in the aggregate principal amount of 484,000 with an interest rate of 8 per annum.
The Notes mature twelve (12) months from the dates of issue. The principal amounts of the notes together with any accrued interest are
convertible into common shares at any time prior or at maturity at a price of 0.10 per common share. The Notes, together with any accrued
interest, shall automatically convert into common shares at a price of 0.10 per share upon the successful uplisting of the Company s
common stock onto the NASDAQ, CBOE or NYSE American stock exchanges.

Going
Concern 

The
unaudited consolidated financial statements included herein have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization
of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. As reflected in the financial statements, we had a working
capital deficit of 2,329,074 at September 30, 2024, and had a net loss of 2,861,013 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, which
raises substantial doubt as to the Company s ability to continue as a going concern for a period of one year from the issuance
of the financial statements. 

Off
Balance Sheet Arrangements 

At
September 30, 2024, we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements that we believe have or are reasonably likely to have a current
or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenue or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital
expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors. 

Critical
Accounting Policies 

Our
accounting policies are more fully described in our unaudited financial statements. The preparation of financial statements in conformity
with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Although these estimates are based on our best knowledge of
current and anticipated events, actual results could differ from the estimates. 

We
have identified the following accounting policies as those that require significant judgments, assumptions and estimates and that have
a significant impact on our financial condition and results of operations. These policies are considered critical because they may result
in fluctuations in our reported results from period to period, due to the significant judgments, estimates and assumptions about complex
and inherently uncertain matters and because the use of different judgments, assumptions or estimates could have a material impact on
our financial condition or results of operations. We evaluate our critical accounting estimates and judgments required by our policies
on an ongoing basis and update them as appropriate based on changing conditions. 

Intangible asset.
 Intangible assets with an indefinite life, consist of store operating rights, are not amortized and are tested for impairment annually
or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that they might be impaired. 

Intangible assets
with finite lives, consist of customer lists, are initially recorded at cost and amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated
economic useful lives of the respective assets. 

Fair
Value of Financial Instruments . The Company accounts for financial instruments under Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements. ASC 820 provides a framework for measuring fair value and requires disclosures regarding fair value
measurements. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly
transaction between market participants at the measurement date, based on the Company s principal or, in absence of a principal,
most advantageous market for the specific asset or liability. 

The
Company uses a three-tier fair value hierarchy to classify and disclose all assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring
basis, as well as assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis, in periods subsequent to their initial measurement.
The hierarchy requires the Company to use observable inputs when available, and to minimize the use of unobservable inputs, when determining
fair value. 

The
three tiers are defined as follows: 

Level 1 Observable inputs
 that reflect quoted market prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets; 

Level 2 Observable inputs other than quoted
 prices in active markets that are observable either directly or indirectly in the marketplace for identical or similar assets and
 liabilities; and 

Level 3 Unobservable inputs that are supported
 by little or no market data, which require the Company to develop its own assumptions. 

The
determination of fair value and the assessment of a measurement s placement within the hierarchy requires judgment. Level 3 valuations
often involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity. Level 3 valuations may require the use of various cost, market, or income valuation
methodologies applied to unobservable management estimates and assumptions. Management s assumptions could vary depending on the
asset or liability valued and the valuation method used. Such assumptions could include estimates of prices, earnings, costs, actions
of market participants, market factors, or the weighting of various valuation methods. The Company may also engage external advisors
to assist us in determining fair value, as appropriate. 

24 

Derivative
Liabilities . The Company analyzes all financial instruments with features of both liabilities and equity under FASB ASC Topic No.
480, ASC 480 ), Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity and FASB ASC Topic No. 815, ASC
815 Derivatives and Hedging . Derivative liabilities are adjusted to reflect fair value at each reporting
period, with any increase or decrease in the fair value recorded in the results of operations (other income/expense) as change in fair
value of derivative liabilities. The Company uses a binomial pricing model to determine fair value of these instruments. 

Debt
Discount . For certain notes issued, the Company may provide the debt holder with an original issue discount and other direct financing
expenses. The original issue discount and financing expenses are recorded as a debt discount, reducing the face amount of the note, and
is amortized to interest expense over the life of the debt, in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. 

Research
and Development . The Company accounts for research and development costs in accordance with ASC subtopic 730-10, Research and Development ASC 730-10 ). 

Under
ASC 730-10, all research and development costs must be charged to expense as incurred. Accordingly, internal research and development
costs are expensed as incurred. Third-party research and development costs are expensed when the contracted work has been performed or
as milestone results have been achieved as defined under the applicable agreement. Company-sponsored research and development costs related
to both present and future products are expensed in the period incurred. 

Stock-based
Compensation . The Company accounts for our stock-based compensation under ASC 718 Compensation Stock Compensation 
using the fair value-based method. Under this method, compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award
and is recognized over the service period, which is usually the vesting period. This guidance establishes standards for the accounting
for transactions in which an entity exchanges it equity instruments for goods or services. It also addresses transactions in which an
entity incurs liabilities in exchange for goods or services that are based on the fair value of the entity s equity instruments
or that may be settled by the issuance of those equity instruments. 

The
Company uses the fair value method for equity instruments granted to non-employees and use the Black-Scholes model for measuring the
fair value of options. 

The
fair value of stock-based compensation is determined as of the date of the grant or the date at which the performance of the services
is completed (measurement date) and is recognized over the vesting periods. 

When
determining fair value, the Company considers the following assumptions in the Black-Scholes model: 

Exercise price, 

Expected dividends, 

Expected volatility, 

Risk-free interest rate;
 and 

Expected life of option. 

Item 3. Quantitative
and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 

We
are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information required
under this item. 

Item 4. Controls
and Procedures 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures . Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate disclosure controls
and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in its reports filed pursuant to
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including
our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow for timely and reliable financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 

As
of the quarter ended September 30, 2024, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer completed an assessment of the
effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e), to determine the existence of any
material weaknesses or significant deficiencies under the Exchange Act. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies,
in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company s
annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. A significant deficiency is a deficiency,
or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting that is less severe than a material weakness, yet important
enough to merit attention by those responsible for oversight of the Company's financial reporting. 

25 

Based
on that evaluation, we concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures over financial reporting were not effective as of September
30, 2024. 

Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting . There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during
the quarter ended September 30, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control
over financial reporting.
