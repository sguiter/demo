Share Repurchase Program On September 22, 2021, we announced that our board of directors approved a new share repurchase program (the 2021 Repurchase Program) under which we are authorized to repurchase up to billion of outstanding shares. Concurrently, the board terminated the remaining repurchase authorization under the share repurchase program approved by the board in February 2019 (the 2019 Repurchase Program). We repurchased common shares for approximately million (including transaction fees) under the 2021 Repurchase Program during third quarter 2024 and common shares for approximately million (including transaction fees) under the 2021 Share Repurchase Program during year-to-date 2024. During third quarter 2023, we repurchased common shares for approximately million (including transaction fees) and common shares for approximately million (including transaction fees) during year-to-date 2023 under the 2021 Repurchase Program. As of September 30, 2024, we had remaining authorization of million for future share repurchases. All common stock repurchases under the 2021 Repurchase Program were made in open-market transactions. We record share repurchases upon trade date as opposed to the settlement date when cash is disbursed. We record a liability for repurchases that have not yet been settled as of period end. There were unsettled shares (less than million) as of September 30, 2024 and unsettled shares (approximately million) as of December 31, 2023 .

For the periods presented, service cost is included in Costs of sales, Selling expenses, and General and administrative expenses with the remaining components included in Non-operating pension and other post-employment benefit costs in the Consolidated Statement of Operations . Fair Value of Pension Plan Assets and Obligations In our year-end reporting process, we estimate the fair value of pension plan assets based upon the information available at that time. For certain assets, primarily private equity funds, the information available consists of net asset values as of an interim date, cash flows between the interim date and the end of the year and market events. We evaluate the year-end estimated fair value of pension plan assets in the second quarter of each year to incorporate final net asset values reflected in financial statements received after we have filed our Annual Report on Form 10-K. adjustments to the fair value of assets or projected benefit obligations were necessary during second quarter 2024 .

Variable rate 

Total debt 

To estimate the fair value of fixed rate long-term debt, we used the market approach, which is based on quoted market prices we received for the same types and issues of our debt. We believe that our variable-rate long-term debt and line of credit instruments have net carrying values that approximate their fair value with only insignificant differences. The inputs to the valuations of our long-term debt are based on market data obtained from independent sources or information derived principally from observable market data. The difference between the fair value and the carrying value represents the theoretical net premium or discount we would pay or receive to retire all debt at the measurement date. Fair Value of Other Financial Instruments We believe that our other financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, receivables and payables, have net carrying values that approximate their fair values with only insignificant differences. This is primarily due to the short-term nature of these instruments and the allowance for doubtful accounts.

 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 In reviewing our results of operations, it is important to understand these terms: 
 Sales realizations for Timberlands and Wood Products refer to net selling prices. This includes selling price plus freight, minus normal sales deductions. Real Estate transactions are presented at the contract sales price before commissions and closing costs, net of any credits. 

Net contribution (charge) to earnings does not include interest expense or income taxes. 

ECONOMIC AND MARKET CONDITIONS AFFECTING OUR OPERATIONS 
 Our market conditions and the strength of the broader U.S. economy are, and will continue to be, influenced by the trajectory of activity in the U.S. housing and repair and remodel segments, inflation trends and interest rates. The demand for sawlogs within our Timberlands segment is directly affected by domestic production of wood-based building products. The strength of the U.S. housing market, particularly new residential construction, strongly affects demand in our Wood Products segment, as does repair and remodeling activity. Seasonal weather patterns impact the level of construction activity in the U.S., which in turn affects demand for our logs and wood products. Our Timberlands segment, specifically the Western region, is also affected by export demand and trade policy. Japanese housing starts are a key driver of export log demand in Japan. The demand for pulpwood from our Timberlands segment is directly affected by the production of pulp, paper and oriented strand board (OSB), as well as the demand for biofuels, such as wood-burning pellets made from pulpwood. Our Timberlands segment is also influenced by the availability of harvestable timber. In general, Western log markets are highly tensioned by available supply, while Southern log markets have more available supply. However, additional mill capacity being added in the U.S. South has led to tightening of markets in certain geographies. Our Real Estate, Energy and Natural Resources segment is affected by a variety of factors, including the general state of the economy, local real estate market conditions, the level of construction activity in the U.S. and evolution of emerging renewable energy and carbon-related markets. 
 Over the past year, home sales and building activity moderated in part due to continued elevated mortgage interest rates, reduced affordability and general macroeconomic conditions. Specifically, multi-family construction has been hampered by a large supply of recently completed projects as well as higher interest rates and other factors constraining the underwriting of proposed projects. In contrast, new single-family home construction has remained resilient, as existing homeowners continued to be constrained by the lock-in effect of lower mortgage rates. On a seasonally adjusted annual basis, as reported by the U.S. Census Bureau, housing starts for third quarter 2024 averaged 1.3 million units, a 1.1 percent decrease from second quarter 2024. Single-family starts averaged 1.0 million units in third quarter 2024, a 4.1 percent decrease from second quarter 2024. Multi-family starts averaged 363 thousand units in third quarter 2024, which was a 7.9 percent increase from second quarter 2024. Single-family construction is the primary driver for our business as compared to multi-family due to the amount of wood products used. Sales of newly built, single-family homes averaged a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 724 thousand units for third quarter 2024, an increase of 4.5 percent from second quarter 2024, supported by builder mortgage rate buydowns and other incentives. Over the medium to long-term, we expect a favorable U.S. housing construction market supported by strong demographics in the key home buying age cohorts, a decade of under building and historically low housing inventory. 
 Repair and remodeling expenditures increased by 1.8 percent from second quarter 2024 to third quarter 2024 according to the Census Bureau Advance Retail Spending report. While there continues to be steady demand due to growing home equity and the lock-in effect of having lower mortgage rates compared to current rates, many homeowners have become more cautious in discretionary spending on large projects. Additionally, some repair and remodeling activity was accelerated during the pandemic which has had some impact on the level of spending. This softness has been reflected in both the do-it-yourself (DIY) and professionally built segments. Over the longer term, we expect this sector to resume pre-pandemic growth trends with healthy household balance sheets, elevated home equity and an aging U.S. housing stock, with a median age of 42 years. 
 In U.S. wood product markets, demand for lumber and OSB was influenced by continued cautious buyer sentiment at the outset of third quarter 2024. As the quarter progressed, demand was mixed as continued strength in single-family housing starts was offset by weaker multi-family construction and restrained repair and remodel activity. The Random Lengths Framing Lumber Composite price averaged 383/MBF and the OSB Composite averaged 346/MSF in third quarter 2024. Over the course of the third quarter, composite prices for lumber increased from 366/MBF to 396/MBF and composite prices for OSB decreased from 352/MSF to 344/MSF. Increased curtailments, in addition to an increase in duties on Canadian lumber imports, contributed to the moderate recovery in lumber prices. In light of these conditions, we reduced our operating rates in third quarter 2024, resulting in a 10.1 percent decrease in lumber production from second quarter 2024 to third quarter 2024, which includes the previously announced indefinite curtailment of our lumber mill in New Bern, North Carolina. We expect to return to more normalized operating rates in fourth quarter 2024. 
 In Western log markets, Douglas fir sawlog prices decreased 3.7 percent in third quarter 2024 compared with second quarter 2024, as reported by Fastmarkets RISI Log Lines based on Weyerhaeuser s sales mix. Overall, domestic log demand and prices faced downward pressure through the quarter, as mills continued to adjust to a soft lumber market and worked through elevated log inventories. In the South, delivered sawlog prices increased 1.0 percent in third quarter 2024 compared to second quarter 2024 and declined 0.4 percent from third quarter 2023, as reported by TimberMart-South. While there continued to be demand for logs across the region, sawlog markets were generally soft given ample supply and in response to mills carrying elevated log inventories and adjusting operations in a soft lumber market. Mill adjustments during the quarter included a series of curtailments and permanent closures. 
 Currency exchange rates, available supply from other countries and trade policy affect our export businesses. During third quarter 2024, end use demand in export markets moderated. In Japan, total housing starts decreased 4.0 percent year to date through August compared to the same period in 2023, while the key Post and Beam segment saw a 5.0 percent decrease. Lumber imports to Japan from Europe increased, which placed some pressure on log sales. China s weaker end-use demand for logs and lumber led to a decrease in pricing for logs from the West. 
 15 

Interest rates affect our business primarily through their impact on mortgage rates and housing affordability, their general impact on the economy and their influence on our capital management activities. Actions by the U.S. Federal Reserve, the overall condition of the economy and fluctuations in financial markets are all factors that influence long-term interest rates. 30-year mortgage rates, which are correlated with long-term interest rates, decreased from 6.9 percent in second quarter 2024 to 6.1 percent in third quarter 2024, according to economic data from Freddie Mac. Many builders have been able to offset higher mortgage rates through discounts, mortgage rate buydowns and modifying product offerings such as home sizes and finishes. Higher rates have also locked-in many existing homeowners from selling, reducing inventories of existing homes for sale which has led to increased demand for available new homes. 
 Increased inflation affects the cost of our operations across each of our business segments, including costs for raw materials, transportation, energy and labor. The Consumer Price Index increased at an annual rate of 2.4 percent as of September 2024 compared to 3.0 percent in June 2024. This rate is markedly down from its peak of over 9.0 percent in June 2022. While we can offset some of the impacts of inflation through our sales activities, operational excellence initiatives and procurement practices, not all costs associated with inflation can be fully mitigated or passed on to the consumer. 
 The condition of the labor market affects all of our businesses as it relates to our ability to attract and retain employees and contractors. The unemployment rate remained flat at 4.1 percent from second quarter 2024 to third quarter 2024. 
 Governments and businesses across the globe are taking action on climate change and are making significant commitments toward decarbonizing operations and reducing greenhouse gas emissions to net zero. Achieving these commitments will require governments and companies to take major steps to modify operations, invest in low-carbon activities and purchase credits to reduce environmental impacts. We believe we are uniquely positioned to help entities achieve these commitments through natural climate solutions, including forest carbon sequestration, carbon capture and storage and renewable energy activities.

The volume of real estate sales is a function of many factors, including the general state of the economy, demand in local real estate markets, the ability of buyers to obtain financing, the number of competing properties listed for sale, the seasonal nature of sales, the plans of adjacent landowners, our expectation of future price appreciation, the timing of harvesting activities and the availability of government and not-for-profit funding. In any period, the average price per acre will vary based on the location and physical characteristics of parcels sold.

 Costs of sales decreased 148 million 4 percent primarily due to decreased sales volumes across most product lines. 
 
 Operating income and Net contribution to earnings 
 
 Operating income and net contribution to earnings decreased 239 million 41 percent primarily due to the change in the components of gross margin, as discussed above, as well as a 10 million noncash impairment charge related to the indefinite curtailment of our New Bern lumber mill recorded in third quarter 2024, partially offset by a 25 million product remediation recovery recorded in second quarter 2024 (refer to Note: 13: Other Operating Costs, Net ).

Comparing Third Quarter 2024 with Third Quarter 2023 
 
 Net charge to earnings increased 7 million 15 percent primarily due to a 10 million decrease in interest income and other, attributable to a decrease in our cash and short-term investment accounts, and a 4 million increase in liability classified share-based compensation. These changes were partially offset by a 9 million decrease in elimination of intersegment profit in inventory and LIFO. 
 
 Comparing Year-to-Date 2024 with Year-to-Date 2023 
 
 Net charge to earnings increased 59 million 48 percent primarily due to a 15 million increase in unallocated corporate function and variable compensation expense and a 12 million decrease in interest income and other, primarily attributable to a decrease in our cash and short-term investment accounts. 
 INTEREST EXPENSE 
 
 Our interest expense, net of capitalized interest, was: 
 69 million for third quarter 2024 and 203 million year-to-date 2024; 

72 million for third quarter 2023 and 208 million year-to-date 2023. 

Interest expense decreased by 3 million compared to third quarter 2023 and decreased by 5 million compared to year-to-date 2023 primarily due to a series of debt issuances and retirements during 2023 that decreased our average outstanding debt. 
 
 Refer to Note 8: Long-Term Debt and Line of Credit for further information. 
 INCOME TAXES 
 
 Our provision for income taxes was: 
 a 15 million benefit for third quarter 2024 and a 38 million expense year-to-date 2024; 

a 54 million expense for third quarter 2023 and a 101 million expense year-to-date 2023. 

Our provision for income taxes is primarily driven by earnings generated by our TRSs. Income tax expense decreased by 63 million compared to year-to-date 2023 primarily due to a decrease in our TRS earnings in 2024, as well as a decrease in our estimated annual effective tax rate. 
 
 Refer to Note 14: Income Taxes for further information. 
 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 
 We are committed to maintaining an appropriate capital structure that provides financial flexibility and enables us to protect the interests of our shareholders and meet our obligations to our lenders, while also maintaining access to all major financial markets. As of September 30, 2024, we had 877 million in cash and cash equivalents and 1.5 billion of availability on our line of credit, which expires in March 2028. We believe we have sufficient liquidity to meet our cash requirements for the foreseeable future. 
 23 

CASH FROM OPERATIONS 
 
 Consolidated net cash from operations was: 
 790 million for year-to-date 2024 and 

1,145 million for year-to-date 2023. 

Net cash from operations decreased 355 million primarily due to decreased cash flows from our business operations, as well as an 11 million increase in cash paid for income taxes. 
 CASH FROM INVESTING ACTIVITIES 
 
 Consolidated net cash from investing activities was: 
 (381) million for year-to-date 2024 and 

(982) million for year-to-date 2023. 

Net cash from investing activities increased 601 million primarily due to a 664 million decrease in cash paid for short-term investments, partially offset by a 65 million increase in cash paid for acquisitions of timberlands.

 CASH FROM FINANCING ACTIVITIES 
 
 Consolidated net cash from financing activities was: 
 (674) million for year-to-date 2024 and 

(571) million for year-to-date 2023. 

Net cash from financing activities decreased 103 million primarily due to a 743 million decrease in net proceeds from issuance of long-term debt, partially offset by a 537 million decrease in cash used for payments of dividends, as well as a 118 million decrease in cash used for payments of long-term debt. 
 
 Line of Credit 
 
 We had no outstanding borrowings on our 1.5 billion five-year senior unsecured revolving credit facility as of September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023. This credit facility expires in March 2028. 
 
 Refer to Note 8: Long-Term Debt and Line of Credit for further information. 
 
 Long-Term Debt 
 
 We have 210 million of long-term debt, with a weighted average interest rate of 8.314 percent, scheduled to mature during first quarter 2025. 
 
 In July 2023, we repaid 118 million of our 7.125 percent notes at maturity. 
 
 In May 2023, we completed an offering of debt securities by issuing 750 million of 4.750 percent notes due in May 2026. The net proceeds after deducting the discount, underwriting fees and issuance costs were 743 million. 
 
 Refer to Note 8: Long-Term Debt and Line of Credit for further information. 
 
 Debt Covenants 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, Weyerhaeuser Company was in compliance with its debt covenants. There have been no significant changes to the debt covenants presented in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K for our long-term debt instruments, and we expect to remain in compliance with our debt covenants for the foreseeable future. 
 
 24 

Dividend Payments 
 
 We paid cash dividends on common shares of: 
 539 million for year-to-date 2024 and 

1,076 million for year-to-date 2023. 

The decrease in dividends paid is primarily due to a supplemental dividend of 0.14 per share based on 2023 financial results for a total of 102 million paid in first quarter 2024 in comparison to a supplemental dividend of 0.90 per share based on 2022 financial results for a total of 660 million paid in first quarter 2023. 
 
 Under our cash return framework, we plan to supplement our base dividend with an additional return of variable cash, as appropriate, in the form of a supplemental cash dividend and/or share repurchase to achieve a targeted total return to shareholders of 75 to 80 percent of annual Adjusted Funds Available for Distribution (Adjusted FAD). For further information on Adjusted FAD see Performance and Liquidity Measures . 
 
 Share Repurchases 
 
 We repurchased 820,706 common shares for approximately 26 million (including transaction fees) during third quarter 2024 and 3,962,220 common shares for approximately 125 million (including transaction fees) during year-to-date 2024 under the 2021 Repurchase Program. During third quarter 2023, we repurchased 757,510 common shares for approximately 25 million (including transaction fees) and 3,562,944 common shares for approximately 110 million (including transaction fees) during year-to-date 2023 under the 2021 Repurchase Program. There were 11,564 unsettled shares (less than 1 million) as of September 30, 2024 and 13,866 unsettled shares (approximately 1 million) as of December 31, 2023. Refer to Note 4: Net Earnings Per Share and Share Repurchases for further information. 
 PERFORMANCE AND LIQUIDITY MEASURES 
 
 Adjusted EBITDA by Segment 
 
 We use Adjusted EBITDA as a key performance measure to evaluate the performance of the consolidated company and our business segments. This measure should not be considered in isolation from, and is not intended to represent an alternative to, our results reported in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP). However, we believe Adjusted EBITDA provides meaningful supplemental information for investors about our operating performance, better facilitates period to period comparisons and is widely used by analysts, lenders, rating agencies and other interested parties. Our definition of Adjusted EBITDA may be different from similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Adjusted EBITDA, as we define it, is operating income adjusted for depreciation, depletion, amortization, basis of real estate sold and special items.

Adjusted FAD 
 We use Adjusted Funds Available for Distribution (Adjusted FAD) to evaluate the company s liquidity and measure cash generated during the period (net of capital expenditures and significant non-recurring items) that is available for dividends, repurchases of common shares, debt reduction, acquisitions and other discretionary and nondiscretionary capital allocation activities. Adjusted FAD should not be considered in isolation from, and is not intended to represent an alternative to, our results reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP. However, we believe the measure provides meaningful supplemental information for our investors about our liquidity. Adjusted FAD, as we define it, is net cash from operations adjusted for capital expenditures and significant non-recurring items. Our definition of Adjusted FAD may be different from similarly titled measures reported by other companies, including those in our industry. We reconcile Adjusted FAD to net cash from operations, as that is the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure.

 Item 3. QUANTIT ATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 
 LONG-TERM DEBT OBLIGATIONS 
 
 The following summary of our long-term debt obligations includes: 
 scheduled principal repayments for the next five years and after; 

weighted average interest rates for debt maturing in each of the next five years and after and 

estimated fair values of outstanding obligations. 

We estimate the fair value of long-term debt based on quoted market prices we receive for the same types and issues of our debt or on the discounted value of the future cash flows using market yields for the same type and comparable issues of debt. Changes in market rates of interest affect the fair value of our fixed-rate debt.

Item 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 
 EVALUATION OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Disclosure controls are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Act is accumulated and communicated to the issuer s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. The company s principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that the company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024, based on an evaluation of the company s disclosure controls and procedures as of that date. 
 
 CHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROLS 
 During third quarter 2024, we completed the implementation of a new enterprise resource planning (ERP) system, which we expect to improve the efficiency of certain financial and transactional processes. As a result of the ERP system implementation, certain internal controls over financial reporting have been modified or implemented to address the new control environment and processes associated with the new ERP system. There were no other changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the company s internal control over financial reporting. 
 
 PART II OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 Item 1. LEGAL PRO CEEDINGS 
 Refer to Note 10: Legal Proceedings, Commitments and Contingencies . SEC regulations require us to disclose certain information about proceedings arising under federal, state or local environmental provisions if we reasonably believe that such proceedings may result in monetary sanctions above a stated threshold. In accordance with these regulations, the company uses a threshold of 1 million for purposes of determining whether disclosure of any such proceedings is required pursuant to this item.
