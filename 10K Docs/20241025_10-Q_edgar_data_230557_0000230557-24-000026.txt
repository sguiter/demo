 During Nine Months 2024 and Nine Months 2023, we had no write-offs or recoveries of our AFS fixed income securities. 
 
 For information on our methodology and significant inputs used to measure expected credit losses, our accounting policy for recognizing write-offs of uncollectible amounts, and our treatment of accrued interest, refer to Note 2. "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" in Item 8. "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data." of our 2023 Annual Report. Accrued interest on AFS securities was million as of September 30, 2024, and million as of December 31, 2023.

 We currently do not intend to sell any of the securities summarized in the tables above, nor do we believe we will be required to sell any of them. Considering these factors and our review of these securities under our credit loss policy as described in Note 2. "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" in Item 8. "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data." of our 2023 Annual Report, we have concluded that no additional allowance for credit loss is required on these balances beyond the allowance for credit loss recorded as of September 30, 2024. This conclusion reflects our current judgment about the financial position and future prospects of the entities that issued the investment security and underlying collateral.

 million increase in "Federal and state pools" as of September 30, 2024, compared to December 31, 2023, was primarily due to reserves recorded in Third Quarter 2024 from our participation in the NFIP Write Your Own Program, driven by Hurricane Helene flood losses, which impacted the Southeastern states of our footprint. These losses are ceded to the NFIP. In addition, the million increase in "Total rated reinsurers" as of September 30, 2024, compared to December 31, 2023, was primarily related to an increase in incurred but not reported recoverable balances related to unfavorable prior year casualty reserve development recorded in Nine Months 2024.

 The increase in direct and ceded loss and loss expense incurred in Third Quarter 2024 and Nine Months 2024 compared to the same prior-year periods included a million increase of NFIP reserves recorded in Third Quarter 2024 for flood losses as a result of Hurricane Helene, which are ceded to the NFIP. In addition, the increase in direct loss and loss expense incurred in Nine Months 2024 compared to Nine Months 2023 was further impacted by unfavorable prior year casualty reserve development of million in Nine Months 2024, compared to million of favorable development in Nine Months 2023.

 The increase in the net reserve for loss and loss expense at September 30, 2024 compared to December 31, 2023, primarily reflected (i) net unfavorable prior year reserve development, (ii) higher catastrophe losses in Nine Months 2024, (iii) exposure increases due to premium growth, and (iv) elevated loss cost trends for the current accident year. 
 
 Prior year reserve development in Nine Months 2024 was unfavorable by million, consisting of million of unfavorable casualty reserve development, partially offset by million of favorable property reserve development. The unfavorable casualty reserve development was driven by our Standard Commercial Lines segment, which included (i) million in our general liability line of business, primarily driven by increased severities in accident years 2020 through 2023, and (ii) million in our commercial automobile line of business, partially offset by favorable development of (iii) million in our workers compensation line of business and (iv) million in our bonds line of business. 
 
 Additionally, in our Standard Personal Lines segment, we had unfavorable casualty reserve development of million in our personal automobile line of business, offset by favorable development of million in our homeowners line of business. 
 
 Prior year reserve development in Nine Months 2023 was favorable by million, consisting of million of favorable casualty reserve development, partially offset by million of unfavorable property reserve development. The favorable casualty reserve development included million in our workers compensation line of business and million in our Excess and Surplus ("E S") casualty lines of business, partially offset by million of unfavorable casualty reserve development in our personal automobile line of business and million in our commercial automobile line of business. 

NOTE 9. 
 reportable segments as follows: 
 
 Our Standard Commercial Lines, Standard Personal Lines, and E S Lines are evaluated on (i) before and after-tax underwriting results (net premiums earned, incurred loss and loss expense, policyholder dividends, policy acquisition costs, and other underwriting expenses), (ii) their return on equity ("ROE") contribution, and (iii) their combined ratios. 
 
 Our Investments segment is primarily evaluated on after-tax net investment income and its ROE contribution. After-tax net realized and unrealized gains and losses are also included in our Investments segment results. 
 
 In computing each segment's results, we do not make adjustments for interest expense or corporate expenses. No segment has a separate investment portfolio or allocated assets.

Forward-Looking Statements 
 The terms "Company," "we," "us," and "our" refer to Selective Insurance Group, Inc. (the "Parent") and its subsidiaries, except as expressly indicated or the context otherwise requires. Certain statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including information incorporated by reference, are forward-looking statements defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 ("PSLRA"). The PSLRA provides a forward-looking statement safe harbor under the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These statements discuss our intentions, beliefs, projections, estimations, or forecasts of future events and financial performance. They involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and other factors that may cause our or our industry's actual results, activity levels, or performance to materially differ from those in or implied by the forward-looking statements.

Introduction 
 We classify our business into four reportable segments: 
 
 Standard Commercial Lines; 
 Standard Personal Lines; 
 Excess and Surplus Lines ("E S Lines"); and 
 Investments.

Table of Contents 

 For more details about these segments, refer to Note 9. "Segment Information" in Item 1. "Financial Statements." of this Form 10-Q and Note 12. "Segment Information" in Item 8. "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data." of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 ("2023 Annual Report"). 
 
 We write our Standard Commercial and Standard Personal Lines products and services through nine insurance subsidiaries, some of which participate in the federal government's National Flood Insurance Program's ("NFIP") Write Your Own Program. We write our E S products through another subsidiary, Mesa Underwriters Specialty Insurance Company, a nationally-authorized non-admitted platform for customers who generally cannot obtain coverage in the standard marketplace. Collectively, we refer to our ten insurance subsidiaries as the "Insurance Subsidiaries." 
 
 The following is Management s Discussion and Analysis ("MD A") of our financial condition and consolidated results of operations, including an evaluation of the amounts and certainty of cash flows from operations and outside sources, trends, and uncertainties that may have a material impact in future periods. Investors should read the MD A in conjunction with Item 1. "Financial Statements." of this Form 10-Q and the consolidated financial statements in our 2023 Annual Report filed with the United States ("U.S.") Securities and Exchange Commission. 
 
 In the MD A, we will discuss and analyze the following: 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates; 
 Financial Highlights of Results for the third quarters ended September 30, 2024 ("Third Quarter 2024") and September 30, 2023 ("Third Quarter 2023"); and the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 ("Nine Months 2024") and September 30, 2023 ("Nine Months 2023"); 
 Results of Operations and Related Information by Segment; 
 Federal Income Taxes; 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources; and 
 Ratings. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 Our unaudited interim consolidated financial statements include amounts for which we have made informed estimates and judgments for transactions not yet completed. Such estimates and judgments affect the reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements. As outlined in our 2023 Annual Report, those estimates and judgments most critical to the preparation of the consolidated financial statements involved the following: (i) reserve for loss and loss expense; (ii) investment valuation and the allowance for credit losses on available-for-sale ("AFS") fixed income securities; and (iii) reinsurance. These estimates and judgments require our use of assumptions about highly uncertain matters that make them subject to change as facts and circumstances develop. If we applied different estimates and judgments, the financial statements might have reported materially different amounts. For additional information regarding our critical accounting policies and estimates, refer to pages 39 through 47 of our 2023 Annual Report.

 2 Non-GAAP operating income (loss), non-GAAP operating income (loss) per diluted common share, and non-GAAP operating ROE are comparable to net income (loss) available to common stockholders, net income (loss) available to common stockholders per diluted common share, and ROE, respectively, but exclude after-tax net realized and unrealized gains and losses on investments included in net income (loss). Adjusted book value per common share is comparable to book value per common share, but excludes total after-tax unrealized gains and losses on investments included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). These non-GAAP measures are important financial measures used by us, analysts, and investors because the timing of realized and unrealized investment gains and losses on securities in any given period is largely discretionary. In addition, net realized and unrealized investment gains and losses on investments could distort the analysis of trends.

 Our non-GAAP operating ROE in Third Quarter 2024 slightly exceeded our 12 target, while our Nine Months 2024 non-GAAP operating ROE was below our 12 target. The decrease in our non-GAAP operating ROE in Third Quarter 2024 and Nine Months 2024 compared to the same prior-year periods was driven by reduced after-tax underwriting income. We recorded after-tax underwriting income of 4.1 million in Third Quarter 2024 compared to 25.0 million in Third Quarter 2023, resulting in a reduction to ROE of 3.5 points. In Nine Months 2024, we recorded an after-tax underwriting loss of 118.0 million, compared to after-tax underwriting income of 54.7 million in Nine Months 2023, resulting in a reduction to ROE of 8.6 points. 
 
 The after-tax underwriting income decrease in Third Quarter 2024 compared to Third Quarter 2023 was primarily driven by elevated net catastrophe losses in Third Quarter 2024, partially offset by lower non-catastrophe property loss and loss expenses in Third Quarter 2024. We were impacted by 19 Property Claim Services ("PCS") named events in Third Quarter 2024. Hurricane Helene, which is estimated at 85.0 million of net catastrophe losses, accounted for the majority of the losses in Third Quarter 2024. 
 
 The after-tax underwriting income decrease in Nine Months 2024 compared to Nine Months 2023 was primarily attributable to unfavorable prior year casualty reserve development in Nine Months 2024. We recorded 211.0 million of unfavorable prior year casualty reserve development in Nine Months 2024 compared to 16.5 million of favorable prior year casualty reserve development in Nine Months 2023. There was no net prior year casualty reserve development in Third Quarter 2024 and Third Quarter 2023. Development in Nine Months 2024 primarily impacted the general liability line of business in our Standard Commercial Lines segment. We believe that current market conditions and environmental factors, most notably social inflation, are impacting us and the industry more than historically. As a commercial lines-focused underwriter with a higher mix of casualty business, we recognize this social inflationary environment has increased loss severities. In response to these external trends and the data we observed in our in-depth quarterly reserve review process during Nine Months 2024, we

 recorded unfavorable prior year casualty reserve development in our general liability line of business, primarily related to accident years 2020 through 2023. 
 
 For additional qualitative discussion on prior year casualty reserve development, refer to the insurance segment sections below. 

Outlook 
 Although our Nine Months 2024 financial results were below our target, our capital position and the quality of our underwriting portfolio remain strong. Given the consistency in our underwriting appetite and risk profile over time, we have focused our corrective actions primarily on achieving higher price levels to reflect elevated and uncertain loss trends. Our prudent underwriting, pricing discipline, strong relationships with our distribution partners, and sophisticated analytical tools have enabled us to effectively balance our pricing and retention objectives over the long term. 
 
 We will continue to balance growth and profitability, with a goal to consistently achieve a 95 combined ratio across our three insurance segments by: 
 
 Standard Commercial Lines 
 Achieving overall Standard Commercial Lines renewal pure price increases that reflect forward loss trend expectations. Our overall Standard Commercial Lines renewal pure price increase was 9.1 in Third Quarter 2024, up from 7.9 last quarter. Excluding workers compensation, our Standard Commercial Lines renewal pure price increase was 10.2 in Third Quarter 2024, up from 9.2 last quarter. In addition, our general liability renewal pure price increase was 10.2 in Third Quarter 2024, up from 7.6 last quarter. We expect that our general liability pricing will remain strong through the end of the year; 
 Continuing to expand our Standard Commercial Lines market share by (i) increasing our share towards our 12 target of our agents' premiums, (ii) strategically appointing new agents, and (iii) maximizing new business growth in the small business market through the use of our enhanced small business platform; and 
 Expanding our geographic footprint. In April 2024, we entered West Virginia and Maine, and in October 2024, we entered Washington, Nevada, and Oregon, now covering 35 states and the District of Columbia. Kansas, Montana, and Wyoming are the next three states we expect to enter over the next two years. Over time, we plan to expand our Standard Commercial Lines footprint to be near national. 
 
 Standard Personal Lines 
 Taking actions to improve the profitability of our Standard Personal Lines segment by: 
 Prioritizing additional rate filings state-by-state and further refining our pricing factors. These filed rate increases began to take effect early in 2023 and increased in number and magnitude throughout 2023 and 2024, and we expect them to continue into 2025. Our Standard Personal Lines renewal pure price increase was 22.8 in Third Quarter 2024 and 18.5 in Nine Months 2024, up from 17.7 in six-months ended 2024; 
 Seeking to improve our homeowners line of business profitability through the introduction of new policy terms and conditions, including (i) coverage for older roofs based on depreciation schedules rather than replacement cost and (ii) implementing mandatory wind/hail deductibles in states exposed to severe convective storms, where law permits; and 
 Continuing the migration of our Standard Personal Lines products and services towards customers in the mass affluent market, where we believe our strong coverage and servicing capabilities can be more competitive, while also limiting the migration in states where, due to regulatory constraints, we cannot charge risk-adequate premiums. 
 
 E S Lines 
 Achieving E S Lines renewal pure price increases that reflect forward loss trend expectations. Our E S Lines renewal pure price increase was 8.0 in Third Quarter 2024, up from 6.4 last quarter; and 
 Continuing to invest in product expansion, risk evaluation, and operational efficiency for small and middle market E S lines accounts.

Table of Contents 

 For 2024, we increased our expected GAAP combined ratio to 102.5 . The change reflects elevated catastrophe losses in Third Quarter 2024, partially offset by better-than-expected non-catastrophe property loss and loss expenses. Full-year expectations are as follows: 
 
 A GAAP combined ratio of 102.5 , up 1 point from our prior guidance of 101.5 . Our combined ratio estimate includes net catastrophe losses of 7.5 points, up from prior guidance of 5.5 points. Although too early to provide a specific estimate, we expect losses from Hurricane Milton, which made landfall on October 9, 2024, to be immaterial. Our combined ratio estimate assumes no additional prior year casualty reserve development; 
 After-tax net investment income of 360 million, including 32 million from alternative investments; 
 An overall effective tax rate of approximately 21.0 , which assumes an effective tax rate of 20.5 for net investment income and 21 for all other items; and 
 Weighted average shares on a fully diluted basis of 61.5 million, which assumes no share repurchases we may make under our authorization.

 The NPW growth of 9 in Third Quarter 2024 and 13 in Nine Months 2024 compared to the same prior-year periods reflected (i) overall renewal pure price increases, and (ii) higher direct new business, as shown in the following table:

 Our NPW growth in Third Quarter 2024 and Nine Months 2024 also benefited from stable retention in our Standard Commercial Lines and E S Lines and exposure growth on renewal policies. 
 
 The increase in NPE in Third Quarter 2024 and Nine Months 2024 compared to the same prior-year periods resulted from the same impacts to NPW described above.

 We had higher net catastrophe losses in Third Quarter 2024 and Nine Months 2024 compared to the same prior-year periods, primarily attributable to Hurricane Helene, which resulted in estimated net catastrophe losses of 85.0 million, or 7.6 points, in Third Quarter 2024, and 2.6 points in Nine Months 2024. Hurricane Helene primarily affected states in our Southeastern footprint. Nine Months 2024 was further impacted by 65 other PCS-named events, mainly wind and thunderstorm events with higher severity, compared to the 60 PCS-named events in Nine Months 2023.

 There was no net prior year casualty reserve development in Third Quarter 2024 and Third Quarter 2023. The unfavorable prior year casualty reserve development in Nine Months 2024 of (i) 216.0 million in our general liability line of business was driven by severities in accident years 2020 through 2023 that continued to show higher than expected emergence and (ii) 20.0 million in our commercial automobile line of business was driven by increased severities in accident year 2023. The unfavorable development in these lines of business in Nine Months 2024 was partially offset by favorable workers compensation development of 20.0 million and favorable bonds development of 5.0 million. 
 
 In addition, the loss and loss expense ratio was adversely impacted by an increase in current year casualty loss costs of 0.7 points in Third Quarter 2024 and 1.0 point in Nine Months 2024 compared to the same prior-year periods, primarily due to increased loss trend expectations and higher prior-year severity assumptions related to the impacts of social inflation on our general liability line of business.

 Underwriting Expenses 
 The underwriting expense ratio decreased 0.3 points in Third Quarter 2024 and 1.0 points in Nine Months 2024 compared to the same prior-year periods, primarily due to a decrease in expected profit-based employee compensation and the growth in premium outpacing the growth in underwriting expenses.

 Net catastrophe losses increased in Third Quarter 2024 and Nine Months 2024 compared to the same prior-year periods, primarily attributable to Hurricane Helene, which mainly affected Georgia and the Carolinas and resulted in estimated net catastrophe losses of 61.5 million, or 7.0 points in Third Quarter 2024 and 2.4 points in Nine Months 2024. Nine Months 2024 was further impacted by 54 other PCS-named events, mainly wind and thunderstorm events with higher severity, compared to the 51 PCS-named events in Nine Months 2023, coupled with increased severity of the events. 
 
 There was no net prior year casualty reserve development in Third Quarter 2024, compared to 3.0 million, or 0.4 points, of favorable development in Third Quarter 2023. Prior year casualty reserve development was unfavorable by 211.0 million, or 8.2 points, in Nine Months 2024 compared to 20.5 million, or 0.9 points, of favorable development in Nine Months 2023. 
 
 Despite increasing our expected loss trend in recent years, loss severities continued to show higher-than-expected emergence in Nine Months 2024 in the general liability line of business. In response to these unfavorable trends, we recorded unfavorable prior year casualty reserve development in our general liability line of business of 216.0 million in Nine Months 2024, primarily driven by increased severities in accident years 2020 through 2023. In addition, we recorded 20.0 million of unfavorable prior year casualty reserve development in our commercial automobile line of business in Nine Months 2024, primarily driven by increased severities in accident year 2023. The unfavorable development in Nine Months 2024 was partially offset by (i) 20.0 million of favorable workers compensation development, primarily due to lower loss severities in accident years 2021 and prior, and (ii) 5.0 million of favorable bonds development. 
 
 In addition, the loss and loss expense ratio was adversely impacted by an increase in current year casualty loss costs of 2.2 points in Third Quarter 2024 and 2.1 points in Nine Months 2024 compared to the same prior-year periods, primarily due to increased loss trend expectations and higher prior-year severity assumptions attributable to impacts from social inflation in the general liability line of business. 
 
 Refer to the line of business sections below for a qualitative discussion on the significant drivers of unfavorable prior year casualty reserve development and current year loss costs. 
 
 The underwriting expense ratio decreased 0.3 points in Third Quarter 2024 and 0.9 points in Nine Months 2024 compared to the same prior-year periods, primarily due to a decrease in expected profit-based employee compensation and the growth in premium outpacing growth in underwriting expenses.

 The general liability line of business has experienced a long-term historical trend of meaningful severity increases that have been partially offset by claim frequency decreases. Prior-year severities have developed adversely, previously impacting the pre-pandemic period, but in 2024 they have extended into the more recent accident years. We attribute the increased severities to elevated social inflation, which we view as an industry dynamic characterized by higher claimant propensity for attorney representation and litigation, longer settlement times, and higher settlement values. Certain jurisdictions with expanded liability theories and higher damage awards pose increased challenges. We are closely monitoring these jurisdictions and the broader trends across our business. 
 
 The unfavorable prior year casualty reserve development in Nine Months 2024 was primarily due to the impact of social inflation, which resulted in higher severity assumptions embedded in our initial loss ratio estimates for recent years. Although we planned for higher expected loss trends, claim emergence in Nine Months 2024 exceeded our expectations. In response to these unfavorable trends, we recorded unfavorable prior year development of 216.0 million in Nine Months 2024, primarily in accident years 2020 through 2023. There was no prior year casualty reserve development in Third Quarter 2024 and Third Quarter 2023. 
 
 Additionally, the combined ratio was adversely impacted by an increase in current year casualty loss costs of 8.7 points in Third Quarter 2024 and 8.9 points in Nine Months 2024 compared to the same prior-year periods, primarily driven by our increased loss trend expectations and higher prior-year severity assumptions for increases in the impact of social inflation. 
 
 We believe that social inflation and elevated loss trends are an industry dynamic, which we expect to lead to a more favorable rate environment in the near term. Given the consistency in our underwriting appetite and risk profile over time, we have focused our actions primarily on prudent underwriting and achieving additional rate. Our renewal pure price increase in this line of business accelerated to 10.2 in Third Quarter 2024, up from 7.6 last quarter, and 6.5 for the first quarter of 2024.

 In addition, the combined ratio was reduced by the following: 
 Despite increasing current year casualty loss costs by 5.0 million in Third Quarter 2024 and Nine Months 2024, current year casualty loss costs decreased 1.7 points in Third Quarter 2024 and 1.4 points in Nine Months 2024 compared to the same prior-year periods, primarily driven by the earned impact of higher renewal pure price increases in both periods as highlighted above; and 
 Decreases in the underwriting expense ratio of 0.8 points in Third Quarter 2024 and 0.7 points in Nine Months 2024 compared to the same prior-year periods, as discussed in the "Standard Commercial Lines Segment" section above. 
 
 Offsetting the favorable combined ratio drivers mentioned above, was unfavorable prior year casualty reserve development in Third Quarter 2024 and Nine Months 2024, primarily due to increased severities in accident year 2023. The unfavorable prior year casualty reserve development in Third Quarter 2023 and Nine Months 2023 was primarily due to increased loss expenses in accident years 2022 and prior.

 We are taking aggressive actions to improve the profitability of this business by continuing to prioritize additional rate filings state-by-state to mitigate inflationary impacts, and further refining our pricing factors. These filed rate increases began to take effect early in 2023 and increased in number and magnitude throughout 2023 and 2024, and we expect them to continue into 2025. We achieved a renewal pure price increase of 22.8 in Third Quarter 2024 and 18.5 in Nine Months 2024, a direct outcome of these actions. In addition, we are seeking to further improve profitability within our homeowners line of business by introducing new policy terms and conditions, including (i) coverage for older roofs based on a schedule of factors rather than replacement cost, and (ii) implementing mandatory wind/hail deductibles in states exposed to severe convective storms, where law permits. 
 
 The change in NPE in Third Quarter 2024 and Nine Months 2024 compared to the same prior-year periods resulted from the same impacts to NPW described above.

 In Nine Months 2024, we experienced (i) favorable prior year casualty reserve development on our homeowners line of business of 5.0 million, primarily due to lower loss severities in accident years 2021 and prior, offset by (ii) 5.0 million of unfavorable prior year casualty reserve development on our personal automobile line of business, primarily driven by increased loss severities in accident years 2021 through 2023. The unfavorable prior year casualty reserve development in Third Quarter 2023 and Nine Months 2023 was primarily due to increased loss severities in accident year 2022 on our personal automobile line of business. 
 
 The loss and loss expense ratio was also impacted by a 6.5-point decrease in current year casualty loss costs in Third Quarter 2024 and a 1.7-point decrease in Nine Months 2024 compared to the same prior year periods, primarily due to (i) significant rate increases and (ii) an increase in flood claims handling fees related to Hurricane Helene from our participation in the NFIP.

Table of Contents 

The underwriting expense ratio increased 0.5 points in Third Quarter 2024 compared to Third Quarter 2023, primarily due to a 1.7-point increase in the ratio related to a reduction in the commission benefit from our participation in the NFIP. Partially offsetting this increase was a decrease in expected profit-based employee compensation and the impact of premium growth on the underwriting expense ratio. The underwriting expense ratio decreased 1.5 points in Nine Months 2024 compared Nine Months 2023, primarily due to a decrease in expected profit-based employee compensation and growth in premium outpacing growth in underwriting expenses.

 Net catastrophe losses in Third Quarter 2024 and Nine Months 2024 included 3.4 million, or 2.6 points in Third Quarter 2024 and 0.9 points in Nine Months 2024, of estimated net losses from Hurricane Helene, which primarily affected Georgia in our Southeastern state footprint. 
 
 In addition, we experienced higher non-catastrophe property loss and loss expenses in Third Quarter 2024 and Nine Months 2024 compared to the same prior-year periods, primarily due to the impact of large fire losses, reflecting the continued period to period variability normally associated with our E S property line of business. 
 
 There was no prior year casualty reserve development in Third Quarter 2024 and Nine Months 2024. The Nine Months 2023 development was primarily due to lower severities in accident years 2021 and prior. 
 
 The loss and loss expense ratio was favorably impacted by current year casualty loss cost decreases of 3.6 points in Third Quarter 2024 and 3.0 points in Nine Months 2024 compared to the same prior-year periods, primarily due to the mix of business between our property and casualty lines of business. Our E S property line of business has a lower loss ratio compared to our E S casualty line of business and represented a more significant portion of this segment in Third Quarter 2024 and Nine Months 2024 compared to the same prior-year periods. 
 
 The decrease in the underwriting expense ratio of 1.3 points in Third Quarter 2024 and 1.4 points in Nine Months 2024, compared to the same prior-year periods, was primarily due to premium growth outpacing underwriting expense growth in both periods. 

Reinsurance 
 We successfully completed negotiations of our July 1, 2024 excess of loss treaties, which cover our Standard Commercial Lines, Standard Personal Lines, and E S Lines. 
 
 We renewed the Casualty Excess of Loss Treaty ("Casualty Treaty") with substantially the same structure as the expiring treaty with a co-participation of 17.5 on the first 3 million in excess of 2 million layer, but with the benefit of additional reinstatements on several of the layers. The treaty year 2024 deposit premium increased, reflecting (i) higher projected subject earned premium due to growth in our book of business, including pure renewal rate increases; and (ii) higher anticipated losses in the excess layers, partially offset by (iii) the introduction of the first layer co-participation. 
 
 We renewed the Property Excess of Loss Treaty ("Property Treaty") with substantially the same structure as the expiring treaty and an additional reinstatement on the second layer of the program. The treaty year deposit premium increased, reflecting higher projected subject earned premium due to growth in our book of business.

 - 100 of 40 million in excess of 50 million layer with 80 million net annual terrorism aggregate limit. 

Investments 
 
 Our investment portfolio's objectives are to maximize after-tax net investment income and generate long-term book value per share growth by maximizing the portfolio's overall total return by investing our insurance operations premiums and the amounts our capital management strategies generate, including debt and equity security issuances. We balance those objectives against prevailing market conditions, capital preservation considerations, and our enterprise risk-taking appetite. We maintain (i) a well-diversified portfolio across issuers, sectors, and asset classes, and (ii) a high credit quality fixed income securities portfolio with a duration and maturity profile at an acceptable risk level that provides ample liquidity. 
 
 The effective duration of our fixed income and short-term investments was 3.9 years as of September 30, 2024. We monitor and manage the effective duration to maximize yield while managing interest rate risk at an acceptable level. We buy and sell investments with the intent of maximizing investment returns in the current market environment, while balancing capital preservation. 
 
 Our fixed income and short-term investments represented 92 of our invested assets and had a weighted average credit rating of "AA-" as of both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Investment grade holdings represented 97 of the total fixed income and short-term investments portfolio as of September 30, 2024, and 96 as of December 31, 2023. 
 
 For further details on the composition, credit quality, and various risks to which our portfolio is subject, see Item 7A. "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk." of our 2023 Annual Report.

 After-tax net investment income earned increased 16 in Third Quarter 2024 and 15 in Nine Months 2024 compared to the same prior-year periods, primarily driven by higher interest rates, active portfolio management, and operating cash flow deployment. 

Realized and Unrealized Gains and Losses 
 When evaluating securities for sale, our general philosophy is to reduce our exposure to securities and sectors based on economic evaluations of whether (i) the fundamentals for that security or sector have deteriorated or (ii) the timing is appropriate to trade opportunistically for other securities with better economic-return characteristics.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Capital resources and liquidity reflect our ability to generate cash flows from business operations, borrow funds at competitive rates, and raise new capital to meet our operating and growth needs. 
 
 Liquidity 
 We manage liquidity by generating sufficient cash flows to meet our business operations' short-term and long-term cash requirements. As discussed further below, we adjust our liquidity requirements based on economic conditions, market conditions, and future cash flow commitments. 
 
 Sources of Liquidity 
 The Parent's sources of cash historically have consisted of dividends from the Insurance Subsidiaries, the Parent's investment portfolio, borrowings under third-party lines of credit, intercompany revolving demand loan agreements with certain Insurance Subsidiaries, and the issuance of equity (common or preferred) and debt securities. We continue to monitor these sources, considering our short-term and long-term liquidity and capital preservation strategies. 
 
 The Parent's cash and components of its investment portfolio were as follows: 
 
 in thousands) September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Fixed income securities 
 283,437 421,089 Equity securities 
 55,795 50,920 Short-term investments

 18,260 18,134 Cash 
 98 180 Total investments and cash 
 433,876 507,994 
 
 Short-term investments have historically been maintained in "AAA" rated money market funds and fixed income securities are comprised of high-quality, liquid government and corporate securities. 
 
 The amount and composition of the Parent's investment portfolio may change over time based on various factors, including the amount and availability of dividends from our Insurance Subsidiaries, investment income, expenses, other Parent cash needs, such as dividends payable to stockholders, asset allocation investment decisions, inorganic growth opportunities, debt retirement, and share repurchases. Our target is for the Parent to maintain liquid investments of at least twice its expected annual net cash outflow needs. 
 
 Insurance Subsidiary Dividends 
 The Insurance Subsidiaries generate liquidity through insurance float, created by collecting premiums and earning investment income before paying claims. The period of float can extend over many years. Our investment portfolio consists of securities with maturity dates that continually provide a source of cash flow for claims payments in the ordinary course of business. To protect our Insurance Subsidiaries' capital, we purchase reinsurance coverage for significantly large claims or catastrophes that may occur. 
 
 The Insurance Subsidiaries paid 44 million in total dividends to the Parent in Nine Months 2024. As of December 31, 2023, 
 41 

Table of Contents 

 our allowable ordinary maximum dividend is 316 million for 2024. All Insurance Subsidiary dividends to the Parent are (i) subject to the approval and/or review of its domiciliary state insurance regulator and (ii) generally payable only from earned statutory surplus reported in its annual statements as of the preceding December 31. Although domiciliary state insurance regulators have historically approved dividends, there is no assurance they will approve future Insurance Subsidiary dividends. 
 
 New Jersey corporate law also limits the maximum amount of dividends the Parent can pay our stockholders if either (i) the Parent would be unable to pay its debts as they become due in the usual course of business or (ii) the Parent s total assets would be less than its total liabilities. The Parent s ability to pay dividends to stockholders is also impacted by (i) covenants in its credit agreement that obligate it, among other things, to maintain a minimum consolidated net worth and a maximum ratio of consolidated debt to total capitalization and (ii) the terms of our preferred stock that prohibit dividends from being declared or paid on our common stock if dividends are not declared and paid, or made payable, on all outstanding preferred stock for the latest completed dividend period. 
 
 For additional information regarding dividend restrictions and financial covenants, where applicable, see Note 11. "Indebtedness," Note 17. "Equity," and Note 22. "Statutory Financial Information, Capital Requirements, and Restrictions on Dividends and Transfers of Funds" in Item 8. "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data." of our 2023 Annual Report. 
 
 Line of Credit 
 On November 7, 2022, the Parent entered into a Credit Agreement with the lenders named therein (the "Lenders") and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as Administrative Agent ("Line of Credit"). Under the Line of Credit, the Lenders have agreed to provide the Parent with a 50 million revolving credit facility that can be increased to 125 million with the Lenders' consent. No borrowings were made under the Line of Credit in Nine Months 2024. The Line of Credit will mature on November 7, 2025, and has a variable interest rate based on the Parent s debt ratings. We expect to continue to maintain a credit facility for liquidity purposes. For additional information regarding the Line of Credit and corresponding representations, warranties, and covenants, refer to Note 11. "Indebtedness" in Item 8. "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data." of our 2023 Annual Report. We met all covenants under our Line of Credit as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 Four Insurance Subsidiaries are members of Federal Home Loan Bank ("FHLB") branches, as shown in the following table. Membership requires the ownership of branch stock and includes the right to access liquidity. All Federal Home Loan Bank of Indianapolis ("FHLBI") and Federal Home Loan Bank of New York ("FHLBNY") borrowings are required to be secured by investments pledged as collateral. For additional information regarding collateral outstanding, refer to Note 4. "Investments" in Item 1. "Financial Statements." of this Form 10-Q. 
 
 Branch Insurance Subsidiary Member FHLBI Selective Insurance Company of South Carolina 1 
 Selective Insurance Company of the Southeast 1 
 FHLBNY Selective Insurance Company of America 
 Selective Insurance Company of New York ("SICNY") 
 
 1 These subsidiaries are jointly referred to as the "Indiana Subsidiaries" because they are domiciled in Indiana. 
 
 The Line of Credit permits aggregate borrowings from the FHLBI and the FHLBNY up to 10 of the respective member company s admitted assets for the previous year. SICNY is domiciled in New York, which limits its FHLBNY borrowings to the lesser of 5 of admitted assets for the most recently completed fiscal quarter or 10 of the previous year-end's admitted assets. As of September 30, 2024, we had remaining capacity of 530.9 million for FHLB borrowings, with a 21.4 million additional stock purchase requirement to allow the member companies to borrow their remaining capacity amounts. 
 
 Short-term Borrowings 
 We made no short-term borrowings from FHLB branches during Nine Months 2024. 
 
 Intercompany Loan Agreements 
 The Parent has lending agreements with the Indiana Subsidiaries, approved by the Indiana Department of Insurance, that provide the Parent with additional intercompany liquidity. Like the Line of Credit, these lending agreements limit the Parent s borrowings from the Indiana Subsidiaries to 10 of the admitted assets of the respective Indiana Subsidiary. The outstanding balance on these intercompany loans was 35.0 million as of September 30, 2024, and 67.0 million as of December 31, 2023. The remaining capacity under these intercompany loan agreements was 146.5 million as of September 30, 2024, and 114.5 million as of December 31, 2023. Additionally, we have other insurance regulator-approved intercompany agreements that facilitate liquidity management between the Parent and the Insurance Subsidiaries to enhance flexibility.

 Capital Market Activities 
 The Parent had no private or public stock issuances during Nine Months 2024. During Nine Months 2024, we repurchased 103,000 shares of our common stock under our existing share repurchase program for 8.7 million, an 84.34 average price per share, excluding commissions paid. We had 75.5 million of remaining capacity under our share repurchase program as of September 30, 2024. For additional information on the share repurchase program, refer to Note 17. "Equity" in Item 8. "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data." of our 2023 Annual Report. 
 
 Uses of Liquidity 
 The Parent uses the liquidity generated from the sources discussed above to pay dividends to our stockholders, among other things. Dividends on shares of the Parent's common and preferred stock are declared and paid at the discretion of the Board based on our operating results, financial condition, capital requirements, contractual restrictions, and other relevant factors. Our Board declared: 
 
 A 9 increase in the quarterly cash dividend on common stock, to 0.38 per common share, that is payable December 2, 2024, to holders of record on November 15, 2024; and 
 A quarterly cash dividend of 287.50 per share on our 4.60 Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series B (equivalent to 0.28750 per depositary share) payable on December 16, 2024, to holders of record as of December 2, 2024. 
 
 Our ability to meet our interest and principal repayment obligations on our debt and our ability to continue to pay dividends to our stockholders is dependent on (i) liquidity at the Parent, (ii) the ability of the Insurance Subsidiaries to pay dividends, if necessary, and/or (iii) the availability of other sources of liquidity to the Parent. Our next borrowing principal repayment is 60 million to FHLBI due on December 16, 2026. 
 
 Restrictions on the ability of the Insurance Subsidiaries to declare and pay dividends without alternative liquidity options could materially affect our ability to service debt and pay dividends on common and preferred stock. 
 
 Capital Resources 
 Capital resources ensure we can pay policyholder claims, furnish the financial strength to support the business of underwriting insurance risks, and facilitate continued business growth. At September 30, 2024, we had GAAP stockholders' equity of 3.2 billion and statutory surplus of 2.8 billion. With total debt of 508.2 million at September 30, 2024, our debt-to-capital ratio was 13.8 . For additional information on our statutory surplus, see Note 22. "Statutory Financial Information, Capital Requirements, and Restrictions on Dividends and Transfers of Funds" in Item 8. "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data." of our 2023 Annual Report. 
 
 The following table summarizes certain contractual obligations we had at September 30, 2024, that may require us to invest additional amounts into our investment portfolio, which we would fund primarily with operating cash flows. 
 
 in millions) Amount of Obligation Alternative and other investments 329.6 Non-publicly traded collateralized loan obligations in our fixed income securities portfolio 96.9 Non-publicly traded common stock within our equity portfolio 24.5 CMLs 2.5 Privately-placed corporate securities 45.9 Total 499.4 
 
 There is no certainty (i) these additional investments will be required or (ii) about the timing of funding. We expect to have the capacity to fund these commitments through our normal operating and investing activities as they come due. 
 
 Our current and long-term material cash requirements associated with (i) loss and loss expense reserves, (ii) contractual obligations under operating and financing leases for office space and equipment, and (iii) notes payable, funded primarily with operating cash flows, have not materially changed since December 31, 2023. The Insurance Subsidiaries' net loss and loss expense reserves duration was 3.1 years at December 31, 2023. 
 
 Our other cash requirements include, without limitation, dividends to stockholders, capital expenditures, and other operating expenses, including commissions to our distribution partners, labor costs, premium taxes, general and administrative expenses, and income taxes. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, we had no (i) material guarantees on behalf of others and trading activities involving non-exchange traded contracts accounted for at fair value, (ii) material transactions with related parties other than 
 43 

Table of Contents 

 those disclosed in Note 18. "Related Party Transactions" in Item 8. "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data." of our 2023 Annual Report, and (iii) material relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as structured finance or special purpose entities, established to facilitate off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. Consequently, we are not exposed to any material financing, liquidity, market, or credit risk related to off-balance sheet arrangements. 
 
 We continually monitor our cash requirements and the capital resources we maintain at the holding company and Insurance Subsidiary levels. As part of our long-term capital strategy, we strive to maintain capital metrics that support our targeted financial strength relative to the macroeconomic environment. Based on our analysis and market conditions, we may take a variety of actions, including, without limitation, contributing capital to the Insurance Subsidiaries, issuing additional debt and/or equity securities, repurchasing existing debt, repurchasing shares of the Parent s common stock, and adjusting common stockholders dividends. 
 
 Our capital management strategy is intended to protect the interests of the policyholders of the Insurance Subsidiaries and our stockholders and enhance our financial strength and underwriting capacity. We have a solid capital base and high-quality underwriting portfolio, positioning us well to take advantage of potential market opportunities. 
 
 Book value per common share increased 7 to 48.82 as of September 30, 2024, from 45.42 as of December 31, 2023, driven by a 2.61 decrease in net unrealized losses on our fixed income securities portfolio and 1.71 in net income (loss) available to common stockholders per diluted common share, partially offset by 1.05 in dividends to our common stockholders. The decrease in net unrealized losses on our fixed income securities was primarily driven by a decline in benchmark U.S. Treasury rates. Our adjusted book value per share, which is book value per share excluding total after-tax unrealized gains or losses on investments included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), increased to 50.80 as of September 30, 2024, from 50.03 as of December 31, 2023. 
 
 Cash Flows 
 Net cash provided by operating activities increased to 767.7 million in Nine Months 2024, compared to 522.3 million in Nine Months 2023, primarily driven by higher levels of cash received for premiums. For more information on our underwriting results, refer to "Insurance Operations" above in this MD A. 
 
 Net cash used in investing activities increased to 687.3 million in Nine Months 2024, compared to 470.0 million in Nine Months 2023, as a result of investing more cash from operating activities. Operating cash flows were 22 of NPW in Nine Months 2024 compared to 17 of NPW in Nine Months 2023. 
 
 Net cash used in financing activities increased to 81.0 million in Nine Months 2024, compared to 64.1 million in Nine Months 2023, primarily due to greater activity in our share repurchase program in Nine Months 2024.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. 
 
 There have been no material changes in the information about market risk set forth in our 2023 Annual Report. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. 
 
 Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act")), as of the end of the period covered by this report. In performing this evaluation, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control Integrated Framework ("COSO Framework") in 2013. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of such period are (i) effective in recording, processing, summarizing, and reporting information on a timely basis that we are required to disclose in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act, and (ii) effective in ensuring that information that we are required to disclose in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is appropriately accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions about required disclosure. No changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) occurred during Third Quarter 2024 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS. 
 
 Incidental to our insurance operations, we are routinely engaged in legal proceedings with inherently unpredictable outcomes that could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations or cash flows in particular quarterly or annual periods. For additional information regarding our legal risks, refer to Note 14. "Litigation" in Item 1. "Financial Statements." of this Form 10-Q and Item 1A. "Risk Factors." below in Part II. "Other Information." As of September 30, 2024, we have no material pending legal proceedings that could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. 

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS. 
 
 Certain risk factors can significantly impact our business, liquidity, capital resources, results of operations, financial condition, and debt ratings. These risk factors might affect, alter, or change our actions in executing our long-term capital strategy. Examples include, without limitation, contributing capital to any or all of the Insurance Subsidiaries, issuing additional debt and/or equity securities, repurchasing our existing debt and/or equity securities, or increasing or decreasing common stockholders' dividends. We operate in a continually changing business environment, and new risk factors that we cannot predict or assess may emerge at any time. Consequently, we can neither predict such new risk factors nor assess the potential future impact on our business. There have been no material changes from the risk factors disclosed in Item 1A. "Risk Factors." in our 2023 Annual Report.
