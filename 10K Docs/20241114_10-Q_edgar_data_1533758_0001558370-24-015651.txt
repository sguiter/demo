 ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S NARRATIVE ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS You should read the following management s narrative analysis of results of operations together with the condensed consolidated financial statements and notes to our financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. This management s narrative analysis is intended to help provide an understanding of our financial condition, changes in financial condition and results of our operations and contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. The forward-looking statements are not historical facts, but rather are based on current expectations, estimates, assumptions and projections about our industry, business and future financial results. Our actual results could differ materially from the results contemplated by these forward-looking statements due to a number of factors, including those discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10 K for the year ended December 31, 2023 under the caption Item 1A. Risk Factors. Furthermore, such forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10 Q, and we expressly disclaim any obligation to update any forward-looking statements. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Overview On December 31, 2023, EchoStar completed the acquisition of DISH Network pursuant to the Amended and Restated Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of October 2, 2023 (the Amended Merger Agreement ), by and among EchoStar, EAV Corp., a Nevada corporation and its wholly owned subsidiary Merger Sub ), and DISH Network, pursuant to which EchoStar acquired DISH Network by means of the merger of Merger Sub with and into DISH Network (the Merger ), with DISH Network surviving the Merger as EchoStar s wholly owned subsidiary. For further information, refer to the Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto included in our Annual Report on Form 10 K for the year ended December 31, 2023. With the Merger complete, EchoStar is currently focused on the process of integrating EchoStar s and DISH Network s business in a manner that facilitates synergies, cost savings and growth opportunities, and achieves other anticipated benefits (the Integration ). We currently operate in two operating segments: our Hughes segment and our ESS segment. These segments are consistent with the way we make decisions regarding the allocation of resources, as well as how operating results are reviewed by our chief operating decision maker. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the ESS operating segment did not meet the quantitative thresholds as prescribed under ASC 280, Segment Reporting , for separate reportable segments, and is not expected to meet the quantitative thresholds or be of continuing significance in the future. As such, the ESS operating segment is no longer considered a reportable segment and we included the ESS operating segment results in Corporate and Other for all periods as presented in Note 11. Segment Reporting . Our operations also include various corporate functions (primarily Executive, Treasury, Strategic Development, Human Resources, Information Technology, Finance, Accounting, Real Estate and Legal) and other activities, such as costs incurred in certain satellite development programs and other business development activities, and gains or losses from certain of our investments, that have not been assigned to our business segments. These activities, costs and income, as well as eliminations of intersegment transactions, are accounted for in Corporate and Other in our segment reporting. Our industry continues to evolve with the increasing worldwide demand for broadband internet access for information, entertainment and commerce. In addition to fiber and wireless systems, technologies such as geostationary high throughput satellites, low-earth orbit LEO networks, medium-earth orbit MEO systems and multi-transport networks using combinations of technologies are expected to continue to play significant roles in enabling global connectivity, networks and services. We expect demand for broadband internet access, connectivity, networking and related value-added services will continue to grow across all major end-user sectors consumer, businesses, enterprises and government. We intend to use our expertise, technologies,

 capital, investments, global presence, relationships and other capabilities to continue to provide broadband internet systems, equipment, networks and managed services for information, the internet-of-things, entertainment, education, remote-connectivity and commerce across industries and communities globally for consumer and enterprise customers. We are closely tracking the developments in next-generation satellite businesses, and we are seeking to utilize our services, technologies, licenses and expertise to find new commercial opportunities for our business. All amounts presented in this Management s Narrative Analysis are expressed in thousands of U.S. dollars, unless otherwise noted. Hughes Segment Our Hughes segment is an industry leader in both networking technologies and services, innovating to deliver the global solutions that power a connected future for people, enterprises and things everywhere. We provide broadband services to consumer customers, which include home and small to medium-sized businesses, and satellite, multi-transport technologies and managed network services to enterprise customers, telecommunications providers, aeronautical service providers, and government entities, including civilian and defense. We also design, provide and install gateway and terminal equipment to customers for other satellite systems. In addition, we design, develop, construct and provide telecommunication networks comprising satellite ground segment systems and terminals to mobile system operators and other enterprise customers. We also offer a robust suite of integrated, multi-transport solutions to enable airline and airline service providers to deliver reliable in-flight network connectivity serving both commercial and business aviation. Our Hughes segment continues to focus its efforts on optimizing financial returns on our satellite portfolio. Our consumer revenue growth depends on our success in adding new and retaining existing subscribers, as well as increasing our Average Revenue Per User/subscriber ARPU ). Service and acquisition costs related to ongoing support for our direct and indirect customers and partners are typically impacted most significantly by our growth. The growth of our enterprise and consumer businesses relies heavily on global economic conditions and the competitive landscape for pricing relative to competitors and alternative technologies. Prior to the launch of EchoStar XXIV, we were nearing or had reached capacity in most areas of the U.S., which constrained growth within our consumer subscriber base. Growth within our Latin America consumer subscriber base in certain areas had also become capacity constrained. These constraints have been addressed by the EchoStar XXIV satellite. The EchoStar XXIV satellite began service in December 2023, bringing additional broadband capacity across North and South America and is expected to be an integral part of our satellite service business. The satellite brings further consumer broadband capacity across North and South America and generate additional sales in other markets, including in-flight Wi-Fi, enterprise networking and cellular back haul for mobile network operators across the two continents. We currently lease the capacity of EchoStar XXIV from an affiliate of ours, EchoStar XXIV L.L.C., effective December 2023. As of September 30, 2024, our Hughes segment had 1.521 billion of contracted revenue backlog, a decrease of 0.4 billion or 22.8 as compared to December 31, 2023. The decrease resulted from the evaluation of the credit worthiness of the portfolio and modifying certain long term agreements. We define contracted revenue backlog as our expected future revenue under enterprise customer contracts that are non-cancelable, including lease revenue.

 Satellite Anomalies and Impairments Our satellites may experience anomalies from time to time, some of which may have a significant adverse effect on their remaining useful lives, the commercial operation of the satellites, or our operating results or financial position. Other than the anomalies related to the Al Yah 3 satellite, we are not aware of any other anomalies with respect to our owned or leased satellites as of September 30, 2024. There can be no assurance, however, that undetected existing or future anomalies will not have a significant adverse effect on our operations or revenue in the future. In addition, there can be no assurance that we can recover critical transmission capacity in the event one or more of our satellites were to fail. Other Developments Operational Liquidity We primarily rely on our existing cash and marketable investment securities balances, as well as cash flow generated through our operations, to fund our business operations. Consumer revenue in our Hughes segment depends on our success in adding new and retaining existing subscribers and driving higher ARPU. Revenue in our enterprise and equipment businesses relies heavily on global economic conditions and the competitive landscape for pricing relative to competitors and alternative technologies. There can be no assurance that we will have positive cash flows from operations. If we experience negative cash flows, our existing cash and marketable investment securities balances may be further reduced. We currently anticipate that our existing cash and marketable investment securities are sufficient to fund the currently anticipated operations of our business through the next twelve months. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we liquidated our marketable investment securities portfolio to make cash distributions to our parent. Future Liquidity We have made cash distributions to partially finance the consolidated operations and debt service payment obligations of our parent company, EchoStar, and its subsidiaries. On February 15, 2024, the Company s Board of Directors declared and approved payment of a cash dividend on the Company s outstanding stock to our shareholder and parent, EchoStar, in the amount of 529 million. On March 12, 2024, the Company s Board of Directors declared and approved payment of a cash dividend on the Company s outstanding common stock to EchoStar in the amount of 500 million. Payment of both dividends was made in the first quarter of 2024. While we currently do not intend to declare additional dividends on our common stock, we may elect to do so from time to time. Payment of any future dividends will depend upon our earnings, capital requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors the Board of Directors considers appropriate. We currently intend to retain our earnings, if any, to support operations, future growth and expansion. Our ability to declare dividends is affected by the covenants in our indentures. We may make additional funds available to EchoStar in the form of prepayments for services rendered or loans to finance, in whole or in part, EchoStar s future operations and debt service obligations. Any such distributions or advances, as well as other factors including, among others, debt maturities, continuing investment in our business, financing acquisitions and other strategic transactions, will reduce the amount of our cash flows available to fund working capital requirements, capital expenditures, acquisitions, investments, debt obligations and other general corporate requirements, and may require us to refinance our existing debt agreements or raise additional capital in the future, which may not be available on favorable terms, or at all.

 The following discussion relates to our results of operations for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023: Broadband Subscribers . We lost approximately 43,000 net broadband subscribers for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the loss of approximately 59,000 net broadband subscribers during the same period in 2023. The decrease in net broadband subscriber losses was primarily due to the new EchoStar XXIV satellite service launch and increased subscriber demand for our new satellite service plans. Churn of legacy subscribers has started to improve as prior churn and migrations have resulted in increased capacity availability and service satisfaction. In addition, net broadband subscriber additions for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were negatively impacted by the ACP program funding concluding on June 1, 2024. We continue to operate in a highly competitive environment, with continued pressure from satellite-based competitors and other technologies. Service revenue . Service revenue totaled 296 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 62 million, or 17.2 , as compared to the same period 2023. The decrease was primarily attributable to lower sales of broadband services to our North American and international consumer customers and our North American enterprise customers. In addition, the three months ended September 30, 2023 was positively impacted by revenue from Hughes Systique which was deconsolidated from our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements as of December 31, 2023. Equipment and other revenue. Equipment and other revenue totaled 86 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 33 million, or 61.0 , as compared to the same period in 2023. The change was primarily attributable to an increase in hardware sales to our North American and international enterprise customers. Cost of services . Cost of services totaled 172 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 40 million, or 30.4 , as compared to the same period in 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in transponder lease costs from the EchoStar XXIV operating lease, partially offset by lower costs of broadband services to our North American and international consumer customers and our North American enterprise customers. Our Cost of services represented 58.1 and 36.9 of Service revenue during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 respectively. This increase primarily resulted from an increase in transponder lease costs from the EchoStar XXIV operating lease, and a change in service mix to lower margin services. Cost of sales - equipment and other. Cost of sales - equipment and other totaled 74 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 31 million, or 72.2 , as compared to the same period in 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to the corresponding increase in equipment revenue. Selling, general and administrative expenses . Selling, general and administrative expenses totaled 98 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 6 million, or 5.6 , as compared to the same period in 2023. The change was primarily attributable to a decrease in costs to support the Company and lower marketing expenditures, partially offset by an increase in bad debt expense. Interest income, net. Interest income, net totaled 2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 20 million, or 89.8 as compared to the same period in 2023. This decrease primarily resulted from lower average cash and marketable investment securities balances during the three months ended September 30, 2024. Income tax benefit (provision), net . Our income tax benefit (provision), net was 16 million benefit for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 11 million provision for the three months ended September 30, 2023. This change was primarily related to a decrease in Income (loss) before income taxes and changes in our effective tax rate. Our effective tax rate during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was impacted by federal and foreign valuation allowances related to investments and foreign losses.

 Net income (loss) attributable to HSSC. The changes in Net income (loss) attributable to HSSC during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 were primarily a result of the factors described in connection with operating revenues and operating expenses. EBITDA. EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure and is described under Explanation of Key Metrics and Other Items section. The following table reconciles EBITDA to Net income (loss), the most directly comparable GAAP measure in our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements: 

For the three months ended September 30, Variance 2024 2023 Amount Net income (loss) (60,260) 22,316 (82,576) Interest income, net (2,322) (22,807) 20,485 89.8 Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized 24,695 22,037 2,658 12.1 Income tax provision (benefit), net (15,822) 10,546 (26,368) Depreciation and amortization 90,719 96,630 (5,911) (6.1) Net loss (income) attributable to non-controlling interests 2,003 2,712 (709) (26.1) EBITDA 39,013 131,434 (92,421) (70.3)

Service revenue decreased primarily due to lower sales of broadband services to our North American and international consumer customers, and to our North American enterprise customers. Equipment and other revenue increased primarily due to higher sales to our North American and international enterprise customers. The three months ended September 30, 2023 was positively impacted by revenue from Hughes Systique which was deconsolidated from our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements as of December 31, 2023. Capital expenditures were 44 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 7 million, or 13.2 as compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to decreases in expenditures related to the construction of our satellite-related ground infrastructure for the EchoStar XXIV satellite. The changes in EBITDA during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023, were primarily a result of the factors described in connection with operating revenues and operating expenses.

 The following discussion relates to our results of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023: Broadband Subscribers . We lost approximately 92,000 net broadband subscribers for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the loss of approximately 165,000 net broadband subscribers during the same period in 2023. The decrease in net broadband subscriber losses was primarily due to the new EchoStar XXIV satellite service launch and increased subscriber demand for our new satellite service plans. Churn of legacy subscribers has started to improve as prior churn and migrations have resulted in increased capacity availability and service satisfaction. In addition, net broadband subscriber additions for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were negatively impacted by the ACP program funding concluding on June 1, 2024. We continue to operate in a highly competitive environment, with continued pressure from satellite-based competitors and other technologies. Service revenue . Service revenue totaled 919 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 183 million, or 16.6 , as compared to the same period in 2023. The decrease was primarily attributable to lower sales of broadband services to our North American and international consumer customers and North American enterprise customers. In addition, the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was positively impacted by revenue from Hughes Systique which was deconsolidated from our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements as of December 31, 2023. Equipment and other revenue. Equipment and other revenue totaled 233 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 35 million, or 17.9 , as compared to the same period in 2023. The change was primarily attributable to an increase in hardware sales to our North American and international enterprise customers, partially offset by a decrease in hardware sales to our mobile satellite system customers. Cost of services . Cost of services totaled 514 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 118 million, or 29.7 , as compared to the same period in 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in transponder lease costs from the EchoStar XXIV operating lease, partially offset by lower costs of broadband services to our North American and international consumer customers and our North American enterprise customers. Our Cost of services represented 56.0 and 36.0 of Service revenue during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. This increase primarily resulted from an increase in transponder lease costs from the EchoStar XXIV operating lease, and a change in service mix to lower margin services.
