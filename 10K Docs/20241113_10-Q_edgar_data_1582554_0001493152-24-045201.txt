 Notes
to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements 

 (Dollars in thousands, except per share data) 

. The Company s net loss was for the nine months ended September 30,
2024. 

The
Company has been engaged in developing its lipid nanocrystal LNC platform delivery technology and a pipeline of associated
product candidates, including MAT2203, since 2011. To date, the Company has not obtained regulatory approval for any of its product candidates
nor generated any revenue from product sales, and the Company expects to incur significant expenses to complete development of its product
candidates. The Company may never be able to obtain regulatory approval for the marketing of any of its product candidates in any indication
in the United States or internationally and there can be no assurance that the Company will generate revenues or ever achieve profitability. 

If
the Company obtains U.S. Food and Drug Administration FDA approval for one or more of its product candidates, the Company
expects that its expenses will continue to increase once the Company reaches commercial launch. The Company also expects that its research
and development expenses will continue to increase as it moves forward with additional clinical studies for its current product candidates
and development of additional product candidates. As a result, the Company expects to continue to incur substantial losses for the foreseeable
future, and that these losses will be increasing. 

As
of September 30, 2024, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of , marketable debt securities of and restricted cash of
 . The Company does not believe the cash, cash equivalents and marketable debt securities on hand are sufficient to fund planned operations
beyond the next twelve months from the filing date of these financial statements. As a result, substantial doubt exists about the Company s
ability to continue as a going concern. 

The
ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon control over its operating expenses, anticipated proceeds from
future sales of common stock through its At-The-Market Sales Agreement ATM with BTIG, LLC. and securing additional financing.
While the Company believes in the viability of this strategy and believes the actions presently being taken by the Company provide the
opportunity for it to continue as a going concern, there can be no assurance the Company will be successful in its implementation. In
particular, utilization of the ATM may not be viable due to market conditions and new financing may not be available on acceptable terms,
or at all. These consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability and classification of
asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going
concern. 

The
Company s significant accounting policies are described in Note 3 within the Company s Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 

The
Company s management has considered all recent accounting pronouncements issued and believes that these recent pronouncements will
not have a material effect on the Company s financial statements. 

of its issued and outstanding common stock (the Reverse Stock
Split ). The Company s common stock began trading on a split adjusted basis on September 3, 2024. No fractional shares were
issued as a result of the Reverse Stock Split as fractional shares of Common Stock were rounded up to the nearest whole share. Unless
otherwise noted in these condensed consolidated financial statements, all shares of common stock, warrants convertible into shares of
common stock, stock options, per share information, and related parameters specified in this quarterly report have been retroactively
adjusted to reflect the Reverse Stock Split for all periods presented. Refer to Note 10 Stockholders Equity for
additional information related to the Reverse Stock Split.

assets and liabilities from operating and finance leases are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of
remaining lease payments over the lease term using the Company s incremental borrowing rates or implicit rates, when readily determinable.
Short-term leases, which have an initial term of months or less, are not recorded on the balance sheet. The Company s operating
leases do not provide implicit rates, therefore the Company utilized a discount rate based on its incremental borrowing rate to record
the lease obligations. The Company s finance leases provide readily determinable implicit rates.

Basic
and diluted net loss per common share 

Net
loss per share information is determined using the two-class method, which includes the weighted-average number of shares of common stock
outstanding during the period and other securities. 

Under
the two-class method, basic net loss per share attributable to common stockholders is computed by dividing the net income attributable
to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted net loss per share
attributable to common stockholders is computed using the more dilutive of (1) the two-class method or (2) the if-converted method. 

During
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, diluted loss per common share is the same as basic loss per common share
because, as the Company incurred a net loss during each period presented, the potentially dilutive securities from the assumed exercise
of all outstanding stock options and warrants, would have an anti-dilutive effect. The following outstanding shares of potentially dilutive
securities were excluded from the computation of diluted net loss per share because including them would have been anti-dilutive as of
September 30, 2024 and 2023:

Overview 

We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company. In October 2024, we
announced that negotiations under a previously disclosed non-binding term sheet regarding global rights to our MAT2203 (oral amphotericin
B) product candidate have been terminated following notification from the prospective partner. As a result, we implemented an 80 workforce
reduction and ceased all product development activities to conserve cash. We may retain an advisor to assist us with a potential transaction
involving MAT2203, and will evaluate other alternatives including but not limited to winddown and dissolution of the company. Prior to
ceasing product development activities, we were focused on delivering groundbreaking therapies using our lipid nanocrystal (LNC) platform
delivery technology (LNC Platform) and sought to develop an internal pipeline of products utilizing the LNC Platform to successfully encapsulate
small molecules and small oligonucleotides and facilitate targeted and extrahepatic delivery to desired cell tissues without toxicity. 

Key
elements of our strategy included: 

Advancing
 MAT2203 into the ORALTO trial for the treatment of invasive aspergillosis in patients with limited treatment options by securing
 a development and/or commercial partner. This initial indication is designed to be a gateway indication to establish the pharmacodynamic
 bridge necessary to expand the use of MAT2203 into other indications to treat deadly invasive fungal infections (e.g., mucormycosis,
 candidiasis and the endemic mycoses) through limited additional clinical work under a 505(b)(2) pathway, thereby making MAT2203 a
 pipeline in a product. 

Expanding
 the utilization of our LNC Platform with other small molecules and small oligonucleotides into inflammation and oncology in order
 to develop an internal pipeline of differentiated drug candidates. Oral, extrahepatic and non-toxic intracellular delivery of these
 molecules would represent a significant advancement. 

17 

Building
 an external pipeline of collaborations focused on our LNC Platform with leading pharmaceutical companies to provide delivery solutions
 for their complex small molecules and small oligonucleotides, including ASOs and siRNAs. 

For
the nine month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, our net loss was 15,818 and 17,628, respectively. We have incurred losses
for each period from our inception and expect to incur additional losses for the foreseeable future. We do not believe the cash, cash
equivalents and marketable debt securities on hand are sufficient to fund planned operations beyond the next twelve months from the filing
date of these financial statements. We seek to fund our operations through public or private equity offerings, debt financing, government
or other third-party funding, collaborations and licensing arrangements. These financing alternatives may not be available to us on acceptable
terms, or at all. As a result, substantial doubt exists about our ability to continue as a going concern. 

Financial
Operations Overview 

Revenue 

During
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we did not generate any revenue. During the three and nine months ended September
30, 2023, we generated 0 and 1,096, respectively, in contract research revenue resulting from the research collaborations with BioNTech
SE and Genentech Inc. Our ability to generate product revenue, which we do not expect to occur for many years, if ever, will depend heavily
on the successful development and eventual commercialization of our early-stage product candidates. 

Research
and Development Expenses 

Research
and development expenses consist of costs incurred for the development of product candidate MAT2203 and advancement of our LNC platform
delivery technology, which include: 

the
 cost of conducting pre-clinical work; 

the
 cost of acquiring, developing and manufacturing pre-clinical and human clinical trial materials; 

costs
 for consultants and contractors associated with Chemistry and Manufacturing Controls (CMC), pre-clinical and clinical activities
 and regulatory operations; 

expenses
 incurred under agreements with contract research organizations, or CROs, including the National Institutes of Health (NIH), that
 conduct our pre-clinical or clinical trials; and 

employee-related
 expenses, including salaries and stock-based compensation expense for those employees involved in the research and development process. 

The
table below summarizes our direct research and development expenses for our product candidates and development platform for the three
and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Our direct research and development expenses consist principally of external costs,
such as fees paid to contractors, consultants, analytical laboratories and CROs and/or the NIH, in connection with our development work.
We typically use our employee and infrastructure resources for manufacturing clinical trial materials, conducting product analysis, study
protocol development and overseeing outside vendors. Included in Internal staffing, overhead and other below is the cost
of laboratory space, supplies, research and development (R D) employee costs (including stock-based compensation), travel and medical
education.

Research
and development activities are central to our business model. We expect our research and development expenses to increase over time because
product candidates in later stages of clinical development generally have higher development costs than those in earlier stages of clinical
development, primarily due to the increased size and duration of later-stage human trials. However, we anticipate that our research and
development expenses during 2024 will be lower compared with expenses incurred during 2023 until such time as we are able to secure additional
funding to support initiation of our ORALTO trial for MAT2203 and advancement of our LNC platform delivery technology. 

General
and Administrative Expenses 

General
and administrative expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 2,142 and 7,067, respectively, and the three
and nine months ended September 30, 2023 were 2,839 and 8,151, respectively. General and administrative expenses consist principally
of salaries and related costs for personnel in executive and finance functions. Other general and administrative expenses include facility
costs, insurance, investor relations expenses, professional fees for legal, patent review, consulting and accounting/audit services.
We anticipate that our general and administrative expenses during 2024 will decrease slightly compared to expenses incurred during 2023. 

Other
Income, net 

Other
income, net is largely comprised of interest income/(expense) and dividends. 

Reverse
Stock Split 

On
August 30, 2024, we effected a 1-for-50 reverse stock split of our issued and outstanding common stock (the Reverse Stock Split ).
As a result of the Reverse Stock Split, each of our stockholders received one share of our common stock for every 50 shares such stockholder
held immediately prior to the effective time of the Reverse Stock Split. Unless otherwise noted, all shares of common stock, common stock
per share data and shares of common stock underlying stock-based awards and warrants convertible into shares of common stock included
in these condensed consolidated financial statements, including the exercise or conversion price of such equity instruments, as applicable,
have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the Reverse Stock Split for all periods presented. 

Application
of Critical Accounting Policies and Accounting Estimates 

A
critical accounting policy is one that is both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operation and requires
management s most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect
of matters that are inherently uncertain. 

For
a description of our significant accounting policies, refer to Note 3 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
in our 2023 Form 10-K. Of these policies, the following are considered critical to an understanding of our Unaudited Condensed Consolidated
Financial Statements as they require the application of the most difficult, subjective and complex judgments: (i) Research and development
costs, and (ii) Goodwill and other intangible assets.

Current
Operating Trends 

In October 2024, we announced implementation of an 80 workforce reduction
(the October RIF and ceased all product development activities to conserve cash. We may retain an advisor to assist us
with a potential transaction involving MAT2203, and will evaluate other alternatives including but not limited to winddown and dissolution
of the company. While this evaluation is ongoing, we expect our R D expenses will be limited to costs associated with supporting the
Company s MAT2203 Compassionate/Expanded Use Access Program and other costs necessary to maintain compliance with certain regulatory
requirements. 

Prior to the October RIF, our R D efforts had been focused on advancing
our lead LNC product candidate, MAT2203, through clinical development toward an initial indication for the treatment of CM and expanding
application of our LNC Platform through both internal efforts and collaborations with third parties. Our R D expenses consisted of
manufacturing work and the cost of active pharmaceutical ingredients and excipients used in such work, fees paid to consultants for work
related to clinical trial design and regulatory activities, fees paid to providers for conducting various clinical studies as well as
for the analysis of the results of such studies, and for other medical research addressing the potential efficacy and safety of our drugs.
We believe that significant investment in product development is a competitive necessity.

Revenues.
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we did not generate any revenue. 

Research
and Development expenses. Research and Development (R D) expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023
was 2,239 and 3,295, respectively. The decrease in R D expense was primarily attributable to lower headcount related expenses,
and lower manufacturing and clinical trial expenses. 

General
and Administrative expenses. General and Administrative (G A) expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023
was 2,142 and 2,839, respectively. The decrease in G A expense was primarily attributable to lower consulting fees and lower headcount
related expenses.

Research
and Development expenses. R D expense for the nine month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 9,057 and 10,824,
respectively. The decrease in R D expense was primarily attributable to lower stock based compensation expense, a decrease in other
payroll related costs due to decreased headcount and the decrease in manufacturing and clinical trial expenses. 

General
and Administrative expenses. G A for the nine month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 7,067 and 8,151, respectively.
The decrease in G A expense was primarily attributable to lower stock based compensation expense, consulting fees and decreased insurance
premiums. 

Liquidity
and capital resources 

Sources
of Liquidity 

We
have funded our operations since inception primarily through private placements and public offerings of our equity securities. As of
September 30, 2024, we have raised a total of 166,907 in gross proceeds and 153,445, net, from sales of our equity securities. 

As
of September 30, 2024, we had unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and marketable debt securities totaling 10,795. 

2024
Registered Direct Offering 

On
April 5, 2024, the Company closed a registered direct offering of 666,667 shares of its common stock and warrants to purchase up to an
aggregate of 666,667 additional shares of common stock, at a combined purchase price of 15.00 per share and accompanying warrant. The
Company generated gross proceeds of approximately 10,000 and net proceeds of approximately 9,190, after deducting underwriting discounts
and commissions and other offering expenses. 

Cash
Flows

Operating
Activities 

Net
cash used in operating activities was 12,375 and 10,699 for the nine month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
Net losses of 15,818 and 17,628 for the nine month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, were partially offset by
working capital adjustments due to the timing of receipts and payments in the ordinary course of business and adjustments for non-cash
stock based compensation expense. 

Investing
Activities 

Net
cash provided by investing activities was 8,708 and 10,282 for the nine month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
The decrease of cash used in investing activities was primarily due to a 8,437 purchase of marketable securities offset by a 6,645
increase in maturities of marketable debt securities and a 218 decrease in the purchases of leasehold improvements and equipment. 

Financing
Activities 

Net
cash provided by/(used in) financing activities was 9,175 and 6) for the nine month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
The increase in cash provided by financing activities is primarily due to the net proceeds received from the sale of our common stock
in the registered direct offering, 9,125, and the net proceeds received from the sale of our common stock under the ATM with BTIG, LLC,
 54. 

Funding
Requirements and Other Liquidity Matters 

We expect to continue to incur administrative expenses and operating losses
as we seek a potential transaction involving MAT2203, and continue to evaluate other alternatives including but not limited to winddown
and dissolution of the company. We anticipate that our expenses will increase substantially if we secure additional funding allowing us
to resume product development activities and: 

conduct
 further preclinical and clinical studies of MAT2203, our lead product candidate; 

seek
 to discover and develop additional product candidates; 

seek
 regulatory approvals for any product candidates that successfully complete clinical trials; 

require
 the manufacture of larger quantities of product candidates for clinical development and potentially commercialization; 

maintain,
 expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio; 

hire
 additional clinical, quality control and scientific personnel; and 

add
 operational, financial and management information systems and personnel, including personnel to support our product development and
 planned future commercialization efforts and personnel and infrastructure necessary to help us comply with our obligations as a public
 company. 

We
do not expect that our existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable debt securities will be sufficient to fund our operating expenses
and capital expenditure requirements beyond the next twelve months from the filing date of these financial statements. As a result, substantial
doubt exists about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. 

Until
such time, if ever, that we can generate product revenues sufficient to achieve profitability, we would expect to finance our cash
needs through a combination of private and public equity offerings, debt financings, government or other third-party funding,
collaborations, and licensing arrangements. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of common stock,
convertible securities or other equity securities, the ownership interest of our stockholders may be materially diluted, and the
terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect your rights of our common stockholders.
Debt financing and preferred equity financing, if available, would result in increased fixed payment obligations and may involve
agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt,
making capital expenditures, or declaring dividends, that could adversely impact our ability to conduct our business. Securing
additional financing could require a substantial amount of time and attention from our management and may divert a disproportionate
amount of their attention away from day-to-day activities, which may adversely affect our management s ability to oversee the
development of our product candidates. 

22 

If
we raise additional funds through collaborations, strategic alliances or marketing, distribution, or licensing arrangements with third
parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs or product candidates
or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings
when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development or future commercialization efforts or grant
rights to develop and market product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves. 

Our
financial condition and results of operations may also be impacted by other factors we may not be able to control, such as global supply
chain disruptions, global trade disputes and/or political instability. Increases in interest rates, especially if coupled with reduced
government spending and volatility in financial markets, may have the effect of further increasing economic uncertainty and heightening
these risks. Additionally, rising inflation rates may affect us by increasing operating expenses, such as employee-related costs and
clinical trial expenses, negatively impacting our results of operations. 

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements 

We
did not have during the periods presented, and we do not currently have, any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined under SEC rules,
such as relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, which are often referred to as structured finance or special
purpose entities, established for the purpose of facilitating financing transactions that are not required to be reflected on our balance
sheets.

Disclosure
Controls and Procedures: 

As
of September 30, 2024, under the supervision and with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer
we have evaluated, the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e)
and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ). Based on that evaluation, our principal
executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable
assurance level as of September 30, 2024. 

Our
disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in the reports
that we filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within time periods specified by the
SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure
that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management,
including principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Except
as set forth below, there were no material changes from the risk factors set forth under Part I, Item 1A., Risk Factors 
in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. You should carefully consider the risk factors contained
in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 in addition to the other information set forth in this
report which could materially affect our business, financial condition or future results. The risks and uncertainties described in this
report and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, as well as other reports and statements that we file
with the SEC, are not the only risks and uncertainties facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that
we currently deem to be immaterial may also have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 

O ur
business to date has been significantly dependent on the success of MAT2203, and we have decided to discontinue further development of
MAT2203 and devote significant time and resources to identifying and evaluating strategic alternatives, which may not be successful. 

To
date, we have invested significant efforts and financial resources in the research and development of MAT2203, which was our lead product
candidate in clinical trials. In October 2024, we announced that negotiations under a previously disclosed non-binding term sheet regarding
global rights to MAT2203 have been terminated following notification from the prospective partner. As a result, we implemented an 80 
workforce reduction effective as of October 31, 2024 and ceased all product development activities to conserve cash. We may retain an
advisor to assist us with a potential transaction involving MAT2203, and will evaluate other alternatives including but not limited to
winddown and dissolution of the company. There can be no assurance that efforts to identify and evaluate a potential buyer or partner
for MAT2203 will result in any definitive offer to consummate a strategic transaction, or if made what the terms thereof will be or that
any transaction will be approved or consummated. If any definitive offer to consummate a sale is received, there can be no assurance
that a definitive agreement will be executed or that, if a definitive agreement is executed, the transaction will be consummated. In
addition, there can be no assurance that any transaction, involving our company and/or assets, that is consummated would enhance shareholder
value. There also can be no assurance that we will conduct further drug research or development activities in the future. 

Any
such strategic transaction may require us to incur non-recurring or other charges, may increase our near-and long-term expenditures and
may pose significant integration challenges or disrupt our management or business, which could 

If
we do not successfully consummate a transaction involving MAT2203, our board of directors may decide to pursue a winddown or dissolution
of our company. In such an event, the amount of cash available for distribution to our stockholders will depend heavily on the timing
of such dissolution as well as the amount of cash that will need to be reserved for commitments and contingent liabilities. 

There
can be no assurance that a transaction involving MAT2203 will be consummated, and previous efforts to do so have not been successful.
If no transaction is completed, our board of directors may decide to pursue a winddown or dissolution. In such an event, the amount of
cash available for distribution to our stockholders will depend heavily on the timing of such a decision and, ultimately, such liquidation,
since the amount of cash available for distribution continues to decrease as we fund our limited operations while we evaluate our options.
In addition, if our board of directors were to approve and recommend, and our stockholders were to approve, a winddown or dissolution
of our company, we would be required under Delaware corporate law to pay our outstanding obligations, as well as to make reasonable provision
for contingent and unknown obligations, prior to making any distributions in liquidation to our stockholders. Our commitments and contingent
liabilities may include (i) obligations under our employment and related agreements with certain employees that provide for severance
and other payments following a termination of employment occurring for various reasons, including a change in control of our company 
(ii) potential litigation against us, and other various claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business and
(iii) non-cancelable facility lease obligations. As a result of this requirement, a portion of our assets may need to be reserved pending
the resolution of such obligations. In addition, we may be subject to litigation or other claims related to a winddown or dissolution
of our company. If a winddown or dissolution were pursued, our board of directors, in consultation with its advisors, would need to evaluate
these matters and make a determination about a reasonable amount to reserve. Accordingly, holders of our common stock could lose all
or a significant portion of their investment in the event of a winddown or dissolution of our company
