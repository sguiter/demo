 Total 
 
 (1) The fair values of our deferred compensation plan investments are based on the closing market prices of the elected investments and are included in other noncurrent assets in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
 (2) The fair values of our interest rate swaps are based upon Level 2 inputs, which include valuation models. The key inputs for the valuation models are quoted market prices, interest rates, forward yield curves and credit risk adjustments that are necessary to reflect the probability of default by the counterparty or us. For disclosures about the fair value measurements of our derivative instruments, see Note 7. 
 (3) The fair values of our investments are valued using a readily determinable net asset value per share based on the fair value of the underlying securities. There are no significant redemption restrictions associated with these investments. 
 
 (1) As of September 25, 2024, impaired assets were written down to their fair value. To determine fair value, we used the income approach, which assumes that the future cash flows reflect current market expectations. These fair value measurements require significant judgment using Level 3 inputs, such as discounted cash flows from operations, which are not observable from the market, directly or indirectly. There is uncertainty in the projected future cash flows used in the Company's impairment analysis, which requires the use of estimates and assumptions. If actual performance does not achieve the projections, or if the assumptions used change in the future, the Company may be required to recognize impairment charges in future periods. 
 
 Assets that are measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis include property, operating lease right-of-use assets, finance lease right-of-use assets, goodwill and intangible assets. During the quarter and year-to-date period ended September 25, 2024, we recognized impairment charges of million and million, respectively, related to certain of these assets. See Note 4 and Note 9.

 The credit facility is available for working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes. The credit facility is guaranteed by the Company and its material subsidiaries and is secured by assets of the Company and its subsidiaries, including the stock of its subsidiaries (other than its insurance captive subsidiary). It includes negative covenants that are usual for facilities and transactions of this type. The credit facility also includes certain financial covenants with respect to a maximum consolidated leverage ratio and a minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio. We were in compliance with all financial covenants as of September 25, 2024.

 operating segments, Denny s and Keke s. In addition, we have identified Denny s as a reportable segment. The Denny s reportable segment includes the results of all company and franchised and licensed Denny s restaurants. Our Keke s operating segment, which includes the results of all company and franchised Keke's restaurants, is included in Other. 
 
 The primary sources of revenues for all operating segments are the sale of food and beverages at our company restaurants and the collection of royalties, advertising revenue, initial and other fees, including occupancy revenue, from restaurants operated by our franchisees. We do not rely on any major customer as a source of sales and the customers and assets of all operating segments are located predominantly in the United States. There are no material transactions between segments. 
 Management s measure of segment income is restaurant-level operating margin. The Company defines restaurant-level operating margin as operating income excluding the following four items: general and administrative expenses, depreciation and amortization, goodwill impairment charges and operating (gains), losses and other charges, net. The Company excludes general and administrative expenses, which include primarily non restaurant-level costs associated with the support of company and franchised restaurants and other activities at their corporate office. The Company excludes depreciation and amortization expense, substantially all of which is related to company restaurant-level assets, because such expenses represent historical sunk costs which do not reflect current cash outlays for the restaurants. The Company excludes operating (gains), losses and other charges, net, to provide a clearer perspective of its ongoing operating performance. Restaurant-level operating margin is used by our chief operating decision maker CODM to evaluate restaurant-level operating efficiency and performance.

Overview 
 
 We manage our business by brand and as a result have identified two operating segments, Denny s and Keke s. As of September 25, 2024, the Denny's brand consisted of 1,525 restaurants, 1,464 of which were franchised/licensed restaurants and 61 of which were company operated. At September 25, 2024, the Keke's brand consisted of 61 restaurants, 50 of which were franchised restaurants and 11 of which were company operated. 
 
 In addition, we have identified Denny s as a reportable segment. The Denny s reportable segment includes the results of all company and franchised and licensed Denny s restaurants. Total revenues at Keke s for the quarter and year-to-date period ended September 25, 2024 represented less than 10 of total consolidated revenues, therefore, the Keke s operating segment is included in Other for segment reporting purposes.

 Company Restaurant Operations 
 
 Company restaurant sales decreased 0.5 million, or 0.9 , for the quarter ended September 25, 2024 and 2.1 million, or 1.3 , year-to-date compared to the prior year periods, primarily resulting from decreases of four Denny's equivalent units for the current quarter and two Denny's equivalent units year-to-date compared to the prior year periods, and a decrease in Denny's same-store sales of 0.4 for the current quarter and 2.0 year-to-date compared to the prior year periods. The decreases in company restaurant sales were partially offset by three additional Keke's equivalent units for the current quarter and two additional Keke's equivalent units year-to-date compared to the prior year periods. 
 
 Total costs of company restaurant sales as a percentage of company restaurant sales were 88.8 for the quarter ended September 25, 2024 and 89.4 year-to-date compared to 86.3 and 86.0 for the prior year periods, respectively. 
 
 Product costs as a percentage of company restaurant sales were 25.8 for the quarter ended September 25, 2024 and 25.4 year-to-date compared to 25.6 and 25.9 for the prior year periods, respectively. The current quarter increase as a percentage of company restaurant sales was primarily due to higher commodity costs, partially offset by increased pricing. The year-to-date decrease was primarily due to increased pricing, partially offset by higher commodity costs. 
 
 Payroll and benefits as a percentage of company restaurant sales were 37.6 for the quarter ended September 25, 2024 and 38.1 year-to-date compared to 37.2 and 37.5 , respectively, for the prior year periods. The current quarter increase as a percentage of company restaurant sales was primarily due to a 0.3 percentage point increase in incentive compensation. The year-to-date increase as a percentage of company restaurant sales was primarily due to a 0.4 percentage point increase in workers' compensation costs, primarily resulting from negative claims development in the current year. 
 
 Occupancy costs as a percentage of company restaurant sales were 8.4 for the quarter ended September 25, 2024 and 8.6 year-to-date compared to 7.7 and 7.6 , respectively, for the prior year periods. The current quarter increase as a percentage of company restaurant sales was primarily due to a 0.4 percentage point increase in general liability insurance costs resulting from negative claims development in the current quarter and a 0.4 percentage point increase in rent and property taxes. The year-to-date increase as a percentage of company restaurant sales was primarily due to a 0.7 percentage point increase in general liability insurance costs resulting from negative claims development in the current year and a 0.3 percentage point increase in rent and property taxes. 

24 

Other operating expenses consist of the following amounts and percentages of company restaurant sales: Quarter Ended Three Quarters Ended September 25, 2024 September 27, 2023 September 25, 2024 September 27, 2023 (In thousands) Utilities 1,959 3.7 2,120 4.0 5,309 3.3 6,037 3.7 Repairs and maintenance 964 1.8 996 1.9 2,977 1.9 2,667 1.7 Marketing 1,859 3.5 1,393 2.6 5,339 3.3 4,207 2.6 Legal settlements 152 0.3 245 0.5 1,809 1.1 475 0.3 Pre-opening costs 209 0.4 105 0.2 766 0.5 130 0.1 Other direct costs 3,785 7.2 3,608 6.8 11,270 7.1 10,900 6.7 Other operating expenses 8,928 16.9 8,467 15.9 27,470 17.2 24,416 15.1 
 
 The current quarter increase in other operating expenses was primarily due to increased marketing. The year-to-date increase was primarily due to increased marketing and unfavorable developments in certain legal claims during the current year period, partially offset by lower utility costs. 
 
 Franchise Operations 
 
 Franchise and license revenue and costs of franchise and license revenue consisted of the following amounts and percentages of franchise and license revenue for the periods indicated: Quarter Ended Three Quarters Ended September 25, 2024 September 27, 2023 September 25, 2024 September 27, 2023 (In thousands) Royalties 29,101 49.3 29,703 48.7 88,421 49.6 90,106 48.2 Advertising revenue 20,172 34.2 19,297 31.6 59,098 33.2 58,818 31.4 Initial and other fees 1,639 2.8 3,388 5.6 5,903 3.3 10,994 5.9 Occupancy revenue 8,146 13.8 8,642 14.2 24,847 13.9 27,165 14.5 Franchise and license revenue

 28,999 49.1 29,810 48.8 89,801 50.4 92,657 49.5 
 
 Franchise and license revenue decreased 2.0 million, or 3.2 , for the quarter ended September 25, 2024 and 8.8 million, or 4.7 , year-to-date compared to the prior year periods. Royalties decreased 0.6 million, or 2.0 , and 1.7 million, or 1.9 , for the current quarter and year-to-date period, respectively, compared to the prior year periods. The decreases in royalties primarily resulted from a decrease of 53 Denny's franchise equivalent units for the current quarter and 40 franchise equivalent units year-to-date, compared to the prior year periods, and a decrease in Denny's domestic franchise same-store sales of 0.1 for the current quarter and 0.6 year-to-date as compared to the prior year periods. The decreases were partially offset by an increase in Keke's franchise equivalent units of two units and three units for the current quarter and year-to-date period, respectively. 
 
 Advertising revenue increased 0.9 million, or 4.5 , for the current quarter and 0.3 million, or 0.5 , year-to-date compared to the prior year periods. The increase in advertising revenue for the current quarter primarily resulted from a 1.0 million increase in local advertising co-op contributions, partially offset by the impact from a 0.1 decrease in Denny's domestic franchise same-store sales and a decrease of 53 Denny's franchise equivalent units. The increase in advertising revenue for the year-to-date period primarily resulted from a 0.7 million increase in local advertising co-op contributions, partially offset by the impact of a 0.6 decrease in Denny's domestic franchise same-store sales and a decrease of 40 Denny's franchise equivalent units compared to the prior year period. 

25 

Initial and other fees decreased 1.7 million, or 51.6 , for the quarter ended September 25, 2024 and 5.1 million, or 46.3 , year-to-date compared to the prior year periods. The decreases in initial and other fees primarily resulted from a 1.6 million and 4.0 million decrease in revenue from the sale of equipment to franchisees during the current quarter and year-to-date period, respectively, as a result of the completion of our kitchen modernization program in 2023. The revenue recorded related to the sale of equipment has an equal and offsetting expense recorded in other direct costs as described below. Occupancy revenue decreased 0.5 million, or 5.7 , for the current quarter and 2.3 million, or 8.5 , year-to-date compared to the prior year periods, primarily due to lease terminations. 
 
 Costs of franchise and license revenue decreased 0.8 million, or 2.7 , for the quarter ended September 25, 2024 and decreased 2.9 million, or 3.1 , year-to-date compared to the prior year periods. Advertising costs increased 0.9 million, or 4.5 , for the current quarter and increased 0.3 million, or 0.5 , year-to-date, which corresponds to the related advertising revenue increases for the current quarter and year-to-date noted above. Occupancy costs decreased 0.1 million, or 2.5 , for the current quarter and 1.4 million, or 8.1 , year-to-date compared to the prior year periods, primarily due to lease terminations, which corresponds to the related occupancy revenue decreases noted above. Other direct franchise costs decreased 1.6 million, or 30.3 , for the current quarter and 1.8 million, or 10.4 , year-to-date compared to the prior year periods. The decrease in other direct franchise costs for the current quarter was primarily due to a 1.7 million decrease in costs from the sale of equipment to franchisees as noted above. The year-to-date decrease in other direct franchise costs was primarily due to a 3.9 million decrease in costs from the sale of equipment to franchisees as noted above, partially offset by a 2.6 million distribution to franchisees related to a review of advertising costs. As a result of the changes in franchise and license revenue discussed above, costs of franchise and license revenue increased to 49.1 and 50.4 of franchise and license revenue for the quarter and year-to-date period ended September 25, 2024, respectively, from 48.8 and 49.5 for the prior year periods, respectively.

The increase for the year-to-date period was primarily due to losses related to dedesignated interest rate swap valuation adjustments in the prior year period. 
 
 During the quarter ended March 29, 2023, we terminated a portion of our hedging relationship entered into in 2018 2018 Swaps ), reducing the previous maximum notional amount of 425 million on August 31, 2033 to 335 million. In addition, during the quarter ended March 29, 2023, we designated the remaining 2018 Swaps as cash flow hedges of our exposure to variability in future cash flows attributable to variable rate interest payments due on forecasted notional amounts. As a result, subsequent to the designation of the 2018 Swaps, gains and losses related to these cash flow hedges have been and will be recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss, net. 
 
 Provision for income taxes was 1.5 million for the quarter ended September 25, 2024 and 4.2 million year-to-date compared to 1.7 million and 5.3 million, respectively, for the prior year periods. The effective tax rate was 18.5 for the current quarter and 22.2 year-to-date, compared to 17.6 and 23.7 for the prior year periods, respectively. We expect the 2024 fiscal year effective tax rate to be between 22 and 26 . The annual effective tax rate cannot be determined until the end of the fiscal year; therefore, the actual rate could differ from our current estimates. 
 
 Net income was 6.5 million for the quarter ended September 25, 2024 and 14.8 million year-to-date compared to 7.9 million and 17.0 million, respectively, for the prior year periods.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 Our primary sources of liquidity and capital resources are cash generated from operations and borrowings under our credit facility (as described below). Principal uses of cash are operating expenses, capital expenditures, and the repurchase of shares of our common stock. 
 
 The following table presents a summary of our sources and uses of cash and cash equivalents for the periods indicated: 
 
 Three Quarters Ended September 25, 2024 September 27, 2023 (In thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities 20,947 50,768 Net cash used in investing activities (17,616) (3,024) Net cash used in financing activities (6,758) (50,245) Decrease in cash and cash equivalents (3,427) (2,501) 
 
 Net cash flows provided by operating activities were 20.9 million for the year-to-date period ended September 25, 2024 compared to 50.8 million for the year-to-date period ended September 27, 2023. The decrease in net cash flows provided by operating activities was primarily due to decreases in operating income, accounts payable, other accrued liabilities, and inventory usage and receivable collections due to the completion of our kitchen modernization program in 2023. We believe that our estimated cash flows from operations, combined with our capacity for additional borrowings under our credit facility and cash on hand, will enable us to meet our anticipated cash requirements and fund capital expenditures over the next 12 months. 
 
 Net cash flows used in investing activities were 17.6 million for the year-to-date period ended September 25, 2024. These cash flows included capital expenditures of 17.7 million and investment purchases of 1.5 million, partially offset by net proceeds from asset sales of 1.4 million. Net cash flows used in investing activities were 3.0 million for the year-to-date period ended September 27, 2023. These cash flows included capital expenditures of 5.5 million, investment purchases of 1.3 million, and a real estate acquisition of 1.2 million, partially offset by net proceeds from the sale of three parcels of real estate for 3.1 million and net investment proceeds of 1.9 million. 
 
 Our principal capital requirements have been largely associated with the following: 
 Three Quarters Ended September 25, 2024 September 27, 2023 (In thousands) Facilities 5,543 3,199 New construction 7,807 730 Remodeling 1,891 404 Information technology 1,376 732 Other 1,093 434 Capital expenditures 17,710 5,499 
 
 Net cash flows used in financing activities were 6.8 million for the year-to-date period ended September 25, 2024, including cash payments for stock repurchases of 11.3 million and payments of tax withholding on share-based compensation of 1.9 million, partially offset by net long-term debt borrowings of 4.4 million and net bank overdrafts of 1.9 million. Net cash flows used in financing activities were 50.2 million for the year-to-date period ended September 27, 2023, which included cash payments for stock repurchases of 35.4 million, payments of tax withholding on share-based compensation of 3.0 million and net long-term debt payments of 14.8 million, partially offset by net bank overdrafts of 2.9 million. 
 
 29 

Our working capital deficit was 53.8 million at September 25, 2024 compared to 59.3 million at December 27, 2023, primarily due to a decrease in accounts payable and other accrued liabilities, partially offset by a decrease in current assets during the year-to-date period ended September 25, 2024. We are able to operate with a substantial working capital deficit because (1) restaurant operations and most food service operations are conducted primarily on a cash (and cash equivalent) basis with a low level of accounts receivable, (2) rapid turnover allows for a limited investment in inventories, and (3) accounts payable for food, beverages and supplies usually becomes due after the receipt of cash from the related sales. 
 
 Credit Facility 
 
 The Company and certain of its subsidiaries have a credit facility consisting of a five-year 400 million senior secured revolver (with a 25 million letter of credit sublimit). The credit facility includes an accordion feature that would allow us to increase the size of the facility to 450 million. Borrowings bear a tiered interest rate, which is based on the Company's consolidated leverage ratio. The maturity date for the credit facility is August 26, 2026. 
 
 The credit facility is available for working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes. The credit facility is guaranteed by the Company and its material subsidiaries and is secured by assets of the Company and its subsidiaries, including the stock of its subsidiaries (other than its insurance captive subsidiary). It includes negative covenants that are usual for facilities and transactions of this type. The credit facility also includes certain financial covenants with respect to a maximum consolidated leverage ratio and a minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio. We were in compliance with all financial covenants as of September 25, 2024. 
 
 As of September 25, 2024, we had outstanding revolver loans of 261.0 million and outstanding letters of credit under the credit facility of 16.1 million. These balances resulted in unused commitments of 122.9 million as of September 25, 2024 under the credit facility. 
 
 As of September 25, 2024, borrowings under the credit facility bore interest at a rate of Adjusted Daily Simple SOFR plus 2.25 . Letters of credit under the credit facility bore interest at a rate of 2.38 . The commitment fee, paid on the unused portion of the credit facility, was set to 0.35 . 
 
 Prior to considering the impact of our interest rate swaps, described below, the weighted-average interest rate on outstanding revolver loans was 7.68 and 7.41 as of September 25, 2024 and December 27, 2023, respectively. Taking into consideration our interest rate swaps that are designated as cash flow hedges, the weighted-average interest rate of outstanding revolver loans was 5.14 and 5.04 as of September 25, 2024 and December 27, 2023, respectively. 
 
 Technology Transformation Initiatives 
 
 The Company has committed to investing approximately 4 million toward a new cloud-based restaurant technology platform in domestic franchise restaurants, which will lay the foundation for future technology initiatives to further enhance the guest experience. The rollout is in progress and is expected to continue into 2025 and 2026. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 
 For information regarding our Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates, see the "Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates" section in Part II, Item 7, "Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 27, 2023. 

Implementation of New Accounting Standards 
 
 Information regarding the implementation of new accounting standards is incorporated by reference from Note 2 to our unaudited consolidated financial statements set forth in Part I, Item 1 of this report. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 
 We have exposure to interest rate risk related to certain instruments entered into for other than trading purposes. Specifically, as of September 25, 2024, borrowings under our credit facility bore interest at variable rates based on Adjusted Daily Simple SOFR plus 2.25 per annum. 
 
 30 

We have receive-variable, pay-fixed interest rate swaps to hedge the forecasted cash flows of our floating rate debt. A summary of our interest rate swaps as of September 25, 2024 is as follows: 
 
 Trade Date Effective Date Maturity Date Notional Amount Fair Value Fixed Rate (In thousands) Swaps designated as cash flow hedges March 20, 2015 March 29, 2018 March 31, 2025 120,000 1,159 2.34 October 1, 2015 March 29, 2018 March 31, 2026 50,000 811 2.37 February 15, 2018 March 31, 2020 December 31, 2033 60,000 (1) 3,942 3.09 Total 230,000 5,912 
 
 (1) The notional amounts of the swaps entered into on February 15, 2018 increase periodically until they reach the maximum notional amount of 335 million on August 31, 2033. 
 
 As of September 25, 2024, our swaps effectively increased our ratio of fixed rate debt from 4 of total debt to 89 of total debt. Based on the levels of borrowings under the credit facility at September 25, 2024, if interest rates changed by 100 basis points, our annual cash flow and income before taxes would change by 0.2 million. This computation is determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on the credit facility at September 25, 2024, taking into consideration the interest rate swaps that will be in effect during the next 12 months. However, the nature and amount of our borrowings may vary as a result of future business requirements, market conditions and other factors. 
 
 Depending on market considerations, fluctuations in the fair values of our interest rate swaps could be significant. With the exception of these changes in the fair value of our interest rate swaps and in the levels of borrowings under our credit facility, there have been no material changes in our quantitative and qualitative market risks since the prior reporting period. For additional information related to our interest rate swaps, including changes in the fair value, refer to Note 6, Note 7 and Note 13 to our unaudited consolidated financial statements in Part I, Item 1 of this report. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 
 As required by Rule 13a-15(b) under the Exchange Act, our management conducted an evaluation (under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer, Kelli F. Valade, and our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Robert P. Verostek) as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act. Based on that evaluation, Ms. Valade and Mr. Verostek each concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act (i) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and forms and (ii) is accumulated and communicated to our management, including Ms. Valade and Mr. Verostek, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by Rule 13a-15(d) of the Exchange Act that occurred during our fiscal quarter ended September 25, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
