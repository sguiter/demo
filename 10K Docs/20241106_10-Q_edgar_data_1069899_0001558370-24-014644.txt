 restricted stock units RSUs to certain officers of the Company, pursuant to the Company s Incentive Plan and the RSU award agreements. Each RSU represents the right to receive a share of our common stock upon vesting. Certain RSUs are subject to time-based vesting and certain RSUs are subject to performance-based vesting. The time-based RSUs vest in five equal annual amounts on each anniversary of the February 2024 grant date. The performance-based RSUs vest on the fourth anniversary of the July 2023 grant date and on the fifth anniversary of the February 2024 grant date, subject to the continuation of employment on such dates, in increments of (but no less than (with linear interpolation between increments) based upon the arithmetic average of the Company s closing stock price per share for each trading day in the -calendar day period ending on the vesting date (the 90-Day Average ). None of the RSUs will vest if the 90-Day Average is below , and 100 of the RSUs will vest if the 90-Day Average is or above. In the event of a change in control of the Company, following which either (i) of the shares of stock cease to be traded on a nationally recognized stock exchange and the Company is no longer listed on any such exchange or (ii) a Qualifying Termination occurs within , all unvested RSUs will immediately vest in full. All RSUs were unvested as of September 30, 2024. We used a Monte Carlo simulation model to determine the grant date fair value of the performance-based RSUs. Assumptions used by the model were based on information as of the grant date and included a risk-free rate of return, expected volatility and an expected dividend yield. The risk-free rate of return is based on U.S. treasury yields for bonds with similar maturities. Expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of the Company s common stock. The expected dividend yield considers estimated annual dividends and the closing share price of the underlying common stock. The fair value of the time-based RSUs is equal to the closing market price of the underlying common stock on the grant date, less the present value of expected dividends over the vesting period. The weighted average grant date fair value of the RSUs granted in fiscal 2024 was per share. We recognize stock-based compensation expense for the RSUs on a straight-line basis over the vesting periods. Stock-based compensation expense related to the RSUs was and for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. At September 30, 2024, there was of unrecognized compensation expense related to the RSUs, which will be recognized over a weighted average period of years.

The deadline to appeal the district court s order expired on September 10, 2024; no appeals were filed and the full settlement amount was released from escrow for payment.

However, future events, such as new information, changes in existing Environmental Laws or their interpretation, and more vigorous enforcement policies of regulatory agencies, may give rise to additional expenditures or liabilities that could be material. For all purposes of the discussion under this caption and elsewhere in this report, it should be noted that we take and have taken the position that neither PAHC nor any of our subsidiaries are liable for environmental or other claims made against one or more of our other subsidiaries or for which any of such other subsidiaries may ultimately be responsible. Claims and Litigation PAHC and its subsidiaries are party to various claims and lawsuits arising out of the normal course of business including product liabilities, payment disputes and governmental regulation. Certain of these actions seek damages in various amounts. In many cases, such claims are covered by insurance. We believe that none of the claims or pending lawsuits, either individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, cash flows or liquidity.

This MD A should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Our future results could differ materially from our historical performance as a result of various factors such as those discussed in Risk Factors in Item 1A of our Annual Report and Forward-Looking Statements. Overview of our business Phibro Animal Health Corporation is a leading global diversified animal health and mineral nutrition company. We develop, manufacture and market a broad range of products for food and companion animals including poultry, swine, beef and dairy cattle, aquaculture, and dogs. Our products help prevent, control and treat diseases, and support nutrition to help improve animal health and well-being. In addition to animal health and mineral nutrition products, we manufacture and market specific ingredients for use in the personal care, industrial chemical and chemical catalyst industries. Acquisition In April 2024, the Company entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement (the Purchase Agreement with Zoetis Inc., a Delaware corporation Zoetis to acquire Zoetis s MFA portfolio, certain water-soluble products and related assets (the Acquisition ). On October 31, 2024, the Company completed the Acquisition at a purchase price of 350.0 million in cash, subject to certain adjustments set forth in the Purchase Agreement. The Acquisition was funded by term loan borrowings under the 2024 Credit Agreement. The product portfolio acquired, which generated approximately 400.0 million in revenue in 2023, is comprised of more than 37 product lines that are sold in approximately 80 countries. Also included in the Acquisition are six manufacturing sites, comprised of four in the U.S., one in Italy and one in China. 2024 Credit Agreement In July 2024, we entered into a Credit Agreement (the 2024 Credit Agreement with a group of lenders. Initial borrowings were used to refinance all our outstanding debt, to pay fees and expenses of the transaction, and for ongoing working capital requirements and general corporate purposes. Borrowings under the Delayed Draw Term A-1 and A-2 Loans were used to finance the purchase price of the Acquisition. See Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Debt 2024 Credit Agreement for additional information. Armed Conflicts Israel and Hamas On October 7, 2023, Hamas militants crossed into Israel from Gaza in a large-scale, surprise terrorist attack. Hamas terrorists invaded Israel, first firing rockets into the country and then carrying out attacks inflicting mass casualties with hundreds more taken hostage. In order to provide immediate assistance to the victims of the attacks and their families, we and our employees provided monetary donations that were distributed to charities that offered relief services, welfare, equipment, food and other necessities. Since the October 2023 attack, there have been continued and escalating hostilities along Israel s northern border with Lebanon (with the Hezbollah terror organization) and southern border (with the Houthi movement in Yemen). It is possible that hostilities with Hezbollah in Lebanon will escalate, and that other terrorist organizations, including Palestinian military organizations in the West Bank as well as other hostile countries, will join the hostilities. Such hostilities may escalate in the future into a greater regional conflict.

 We have three manufacturing sites in Israel. A manufacturing plant in Neot Hovav that produces active pharmaceutical ingredients for certain of our anticoccidial and antimicrobial products, a facility in Beit Shemesh that produces vaccines and a plant in Petah Tikvah that manufactures premix products and nutritional products. In addition, we have an office location near Tel Aviv in Airport City. As of September 30, 2024, we had approximately 500 employees located in Israel. While we initially had some disruption to our operations at the onset of the Israel-Hamas conflict, at the current time, we have confidence in our ability to meet our supply commitment to customers and maintain sufficient inventory to continue regional support. A significant escalation of the tensions in Israel occurred on April 13, 2024, when Iran launched more than 300 drones and missiles against Israel, but we had no material disruption to our business. Iran has threatened to continue to attack Israel. Iran is also believed to have a strong influence among extremist groups in the region, such as Hamas in Gaza, Hezbollah in Lebanon, the Houthi movement in Yemen and various rebel militia groups in Syria and Iraq. While the situation surrounding the ongoing conflict remains fluid, our operations in Israel have navigated numerous challenging situations over the years. The prolonged continuation or escalation of this conflict may trigger bans, economic and other sanctions, as well as broader military conflict, which could include neighboring nations and their respective allies. The potential impact of the current conflict, or escalation thereof, on our business is unclear but may include, without limitation, the possible disruption of our operations, particularly at our facilities in Israel, supply chain and logistics disruptions, personnel and raw material shortages, and other consequences, including as a result of the actions of, or disruption of the operations of, certain regulatory and governmental authorities and of certain of our suppliers, collaborative partners, licensees, manufacturing sites, distributors and customers. Our Israeli manufacturing facilities and local operations account for 25 of our consolidated assets as of September 30, 2024, and 20 of our consolidated net sales, for the three months ended September 30, 2024. Russia and Ukraine In response to the armed conflict between Russia and Ukraine that began in February 2022, we and our employees have provided support to Ukraine in the form of monetary donations, free products and humanitarian services. Our limited intent for the Russian market is to continue to provide medicines and vaccines, and related regulatory and technical support, to help existing customers combat disease challenges in the production of food animals on their farms. We have no production or direct distribution operations and no planned investments in Russia. Since the conflict began, the United States and other North Atlantic Treaty Organization NATO member states, as well as non-member states, announced targeted economic sanctions on Russia, including certain Russian citizens and enterprises. The continuation or escalation of the conflict may trigger additional economic and other sanctions, as well as broader military conflict. The potential impacts of any resulting bans, sanctions, boycotts or broader military conflicts on our business are uncertain. The potential impacts could include supply chain and logistics disruptions, macroeconomic impacts resulting from the exclusion of Russian financial institutions from the global banking system, volatility in foreign exchange rates and interest rates, inflationary pressures on raw materials and energy as well as heightened cybersecurity threats. Our sales to Russia and Ukraine for the 12 months ended September 30, 2024 represented approximately 1 of consolidated net sales. We cannot know if the conflict could escalate and result in broader economic and security concerns that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations. Industry growth We believe global population growth, the growth of the global middle class and the productivity improvements needed due to limitations of arable land and water supplies have supported and will continue to support growth of the animal health industry. Regulatory developments In April 2016, the Food and Drug Administration FDA began initial steps to withdraw approval of carbadox (the active ingredient in our Mecadox product) via a regulatory process known as a Notice of Opportunity for Hearing NOOH ), due to concerns that certain residues from the product may persist in animal tissues for longer than previously determined. In the years following, Phibro has continued an ongoing process of responding collaboratively and transparently to the FDA s Center for Veterinary Medicine CVM inquiries and has provided extensive and meticulous research and data that confirmed the safety of carbadox. In July 2020, the FDA announced it would not proceed to a hearing on the scientific concerns raised in the 2016 NOOH,

 consistent with the normal regulatory procedure, but instead announced that it was withdrawing the 2016 NOOH and issuing a proposed order to review the regulatory method for carbadox. Phibro reiterated the safety of carbadox and the appropriateness of the regulatory method and offered to work with the CVM to generate additional data to support the existing regulatory method or select a suitable alternative regulatory method. In March 2022, the FDA held a Part 15 virtual public hearing seeking data and information related to the safety of carbadox in which Phibro participated and again detailed the research and data that confirm the safety of carbadox. In November 2023, the FDA issued a final order to revoke the approved method for detecting carbadox residues. The FDA also provided notice in the Federal Register proposing to withdraw approval of all NADAs providing for use of carbadox in medicated swine feed and announcing an opportunity for Phibro to request a hearing on this proposal. This second action is based on CVM s determination that there is no approved regulatory method to detect carbadox residues in the edible tissues of the treated swine. Phibro is continuing to defend swine producers ability to use Mecadox. We have requested a full evidentiary hearing on the merits before an administrative law judge. In January 2024, Phibro filed a lawsuit in the D.C. Federal District Court asking the court to invalidate the order which revoked the regulatory method for carbadox. Should we be unable to successfully defend the safety of the product, the loss of carbadox sales will have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Sales of Mecadox (carbadox) for the twelve months ended September 30, 2024 were approximately 22 million. As of the date of the filing of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, Mecadox continues to be available for use by swine producers.

 Gross profit Gross profit of 83.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, increased 15.8 million, or 23 , as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. Gross margin increased 280 basis points to 32.1 of net sales for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 29.3 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The improvement in gross margin is primarily due to favorable product mix and lower input costs. Animal Health gross profit increased 13.7 million due to higher sales volume. Mineral Nutrition gross profit increased 0.9 million, driven by higher sales volume, partially offset by a decrease in average selling prices. Performance Products gross profit increased 1.1 million primarily as a result of higher demand. Selling, general and administrative expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses SG A of 65.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, decreased 2.7 million, or 4 , as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. SG A for the three months ended September 30, 2024 included 3.4 million for acquisition-related costs, 0.4 million of costs associated with Phibro Forward income growth initiatives, and 0.2 million of stock-based compensation expense. SG A for the three months ended September 30, 2023 included 10.4 million of pension settlement cost and 0.1 million of stock-based compensation expense. Excluding these items, SG A increased 3.9 million. Animal Health SG A increased 2.2 million, primarily as a result of an increase in employee-related costs, due in part to support new product launches and business activities related to the Acquisition, and partially offset by lower research and development expense. Mineral Nutrition and Performance Products SG A were comparable to the prior year. Corporate costs increased by 1.7 million due to an increase in employee-related costs. Interest expense, net Interest expense, net of 7.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, increased by 3.1 million, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily driven by costs associated with the refinancing of the Company s debt, higher average credit facility borrowings, and higher interest rates in the quarter ended September 30, 2024. Foreign currency losses, net Foreign currency losses, net for the three months ended September 30, 2024, were 0.4 million, as compared to 6.7 million of net losses for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Current period losses were driven by fluctuations in certain currencies related to the U.S. dollar. Provision (benefit) for income taxes The provision for income taxes was 2.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, on pre-tax income of 9.6 million, compared to a benefit for income taxes of 3.9 million on a pre-tax loss of 12.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The effective income tax rate was 27.5 and 33.1 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The effective income tax rate in the current year included (i) a 0.3 million expense from changes in uncertain tax positions related to prior years and (ii) certain charges, including acquisition transaction costs, foreign currency losses, and stock-based compensation, which had lower tax benefit rates. The benefit for income taxes during the three months ended September 30, 2023, included (i) a 1.2 million benefit related to the determination of whether a foreign tax is eligible for a U.S. foreign tax credit related to our fiscal year 2023, based on IRS guidance provided subsequent to our fiscal year-end, (ii) a 0.2 million expense from changes in uncertain tax positions related to prior years, and (iii) certain charges, including acquisition-related costs, foreign currency losses, and stock-based compensation, which had lower tax benefit rates. Excluding the items discussed above, the effective income tax rate was 22.8 and 27.6 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, with the improvement primarily driven by a favorable mix of international earnings.

 Operating activities Operating activities provided 12.6 million of net cash for the three months ended September 30, 2024. Cash provided by net income, adjusted for non-cash items, including depreciation and amortization, was 10.7 million. Cash provided in the ordinary course of business from changes in operating assets and liabilities and other items was 1.9 million. Cash provided by accounts receivable was 9.2 million as a result of quarterly variations in sales levels. Accrued expenses and other liabilities used cash of 3.5 million, primarily due to employee-related liabilities. Investing activities Investing activities used 2.9 million of net cash for the three months ended September 30, 2024. Capital expenditures totaled 9.6 million as we continue to invest in expanding production capacity and productivity improvements. Maturities of our short-term investments provided 6.0 million in cash. Financing activities Financing activities used 29.2 million of net cash for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and reflect the impact of the refinancing of our debt portfolio in July 2024. Net revolver borrowings on our credit facilities provided 3.0 million in cash. Proceeds of 300.0 million from the refinancing, as well as revolving credit facility borrowings were used to pay the remaining principal balances of the outstanding debt of 313.1 million. We paid 1.9 million in scheduled quarterly principal payments on long-term debt during the quarter ended September 30, 2024. We also paid 10.4 million in debt issuance costs related to the refinancing and 4.9 million in dividends to holders of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock. Liquidity and capital resources We believe our cash on hand, operating cash flows and financing arrangements, including the availability of borrowings under the 2024 Credit Facility, will be sufficient to support our ongoing cash needs. We have considered the current and potential future effects of the macroeconomic market conditions in the financial markets. At this time, we expect adequate liquidity for at least the next twelve months. We can provide no assurance that our liquidity and capital resources will be adequate for future funding requirements. We believe we will be able to comply with the terms of the covenants under the 2024 Credit Facilities based on our operating plan. In the event of adverse operating results and/or violation of covenants under the facilities, there can be no assurance we would be able to obtain waivers or amendments. Other risks to our meeting future funding requirements include global economic conditions and macroeconomic, business and financial disruptions that could arise, including ongoing conflicts between Israel and Hamas and neighboring factions and countries, and between Russia and Ukraine. There can be no assurance that a challenging economic environment or an economic downturn would not affect our liquidity or ability to obtain future financing or fund operations or investment opportunities. In addition, our debt covenants may restrict our ability to invest. Certain relevant measures of our liquidity and capital resources are as follows:

We calculate the ratio of current assets to current liabilities based on this definition. 

 31 

Table of Contents 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 179.0 million in outstanding borrowings under the 2024 Revolver and had outstanding letters of credit and other commitments of 2.3 million, leaving 128.7 million available for further borrowings and letters of credit, subject to restrictions in our 2024 Credit Facilities. We currently intend to pay quarterly dividends on our Class A common stock and Class B common stock, subject to approval from the Board of Directors. On November 5, 2024, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of 0.12 per share on Class A common stock and Class B common stock, payable on December 18, 2024. Our future ability to pay dividends will depend upon our results of operations, financial condition, capital requirements, our ability to obtain funds from our subsidiaries and other factors that our Board of Directors deems relevant. Additionally, the terms of our current and any future agreements governing our indebtedness could limit our ability to pay dividends or make other distributions. As of September 30, 2024, our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments included 87.4 million held by our international subsidiaries. There are no restrictions on cash distributions to PAHC from our international subsidiaries. Distributions may be subject to taxation by U.S. or non-U.S. taxing authorities. Contractual obligations As of September 30, 2024, there were no material changes in payments due under contractual obligations from those disclosed in the Annual Report. Off-balance sheet arrangements We do not currently use off-balance sheet arrangements for the purpose of credit enhancement, hedging transactions, investment or other financial purposes. In the ordinary course of business, we may indemnify our counterparties against certain liabilities that may arise. These indemnifications typically pertain to environmental matters. If the indemnified party were to make a successful claim pursuant to the terms of the indemnification, we would be required to reimburse the loss. These indemnifications generally are subject to certain restrictions and limitations. General description of non-GAAP financial measures Adjusted EBITDA Adjusted EBITDA is an alternative view of performance used by management as our primary operating measure, and we believe that investors understanding of our performance is enhanced by disclosing this performance measure. We report Adjusted EBITDA to reflect the results of our operations prior to considering certain income statement elements and to make financial and operating decisions. We calculate EBITDA as net income (loss) plus (i) interest expense, net, (ii) provision for income taxes or less benefit for income taxes, and (iii) depreciation and amortization. We calculate Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA plus (a) other expense or less other income, as separately reported on our consolidated statements of operations, including foreign currency (gains) losses, net and (b) certain items that we consider to be unusual, non-operational or non-recurring. The Adjusted EBITDA measure is not, and should not be viewed as, a substitute for GAAP reported net income (loss) and should not be viewed as a measure of liquidity. The Adjusted EBITDA measure is an important internal measurement for us. We measure our overall performance on this basis in conjunction with other performance metrics. The following are examples of how our Adjusted EBITDA measure is utilized: senior management receives a monthly analysis of our operating results that is prepared on an Adjusted EBITDA basis; our annual budgets are prepared on an Adjusted EBITDA basis; and other goal-setting and performance measurements are prepared on an Adjusted EBITDA basis.

Table of Contents 
 Despite the importance of this measure to management in goal setting and performance measurement, Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure that has no standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and, therefore, has limits in its usefulness to investors. Because of its non-standardized definition, Adjusted EBITDA, unlike GAAP net income (loss), may not be comparable to the calculation of similar measures of other companies. Adjusted EBITDA is presented to permit investors to more fully understand how management assesses performance. We also recognize that, as an internal measure of performance, the Adjusted EBITDA measure has limitations, and we do not restrict our performance management process solely to this metric. A limitation of the Adjusted EBITDA measure is that it provides a view of our operations without including all events during a period, such as the depreciation of property, plant and equipment or amortization of acquired intangibles, and does not provide a comparable view of our performance to other companies. Adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share Adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share represent alternative views of performance, and we believe investors understanding of our performance is enhanced by disclosing these performance measures. We report adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share to portray the results of our operations prior to considering certain income statement elements. We calculate adjusted net income as net income (loss) plus (i) acquisition-related intangible amortization and other acquisition-related items, (ii) certain items we consider to be unusual, non-operational or non-recurring, (iii) stock-based compensation, (iv) foreign currency (gains) losses, as separately reported on our consolidated statements of operations, and (v) the income tax effect of pre-tax income adjustments and certain income tax items. Adjusted diluted earnings per share is calculated using the adjusted net income divided by the diluted weighted average number of shares. The adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share measures are not, and should not be viewed as, a substitute for GAAP reported net income (loss). Adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share are non-GAAP financial measures that have no standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and, therefore, have limits in their usefulness to investors. Because of its non-standardized definition, adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share, unlike GAAP net income (loss), may not be comparable to the calculation of similar measures of other companies. Adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share are presented to permit investors to more fully understand how management assesses performance. Certain significant items Adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share are calculated prior to considering acquisition-related items and certain other items, as detailed in the table titled Items Excluded from Adjusted Net Income above. We evaluate such items on an individual basis. Such evaluation considers both the quantitative and the qualitative aspect of their unusual or non-operational or non-recurring nature. Unusual, in this context, may represent items that are not part of our ongoing business; items that, either as a result of their nature or size, we would not expect to occur as part of our normal business on a regular basis. We consider acquisition-related activities and business restructuring costs related to productivity and cost saving initiatives to be unusual items that we do not expect to occur as part of our normal business on a regular basis. We consider foreign currency gains and losses to be non-operational because they arise principally from intercompany transactions and are largely non-cash in nature.

 Critical Accounting Policies Our significant accounting policies, which include management s best estimates and judgments, are included in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended June 30, 2024 included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities Exchange Commission on August 28, 2024. There have been no significant changes in our critical accounting estimates since June 30, 2024. Forward-Looking Statements This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties. All statements other than statements of historical or current fact included in this report are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements discuss our current expectations and projections relating to our financial condition, results of operations, plans, objectives, future performance and business. You can identify forward-looking statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. These statements may include words such as aim, anticipate, believe, estimate, expect, forecast, outlook, potential, project, projection, plan, intend, seek, may, could, would, will, should, can, can have, likely, the negatives thereof and other words and terms of similar meaning in connection with any discussion of the timing or nature of future operating or financial performance or other events. For example, all statements we make relating to our estimated and projected earnings, revenues, costs, expenditures, cash flows, growth rates and financial results, our plans and objectives for future operations, growth or initiatives, strategies, or the expected outcome or impact of pending or threatened litigation are forward-looking statements. All forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those that we expected. Examples of such risks and uncertainties include: outbreaks of animal diseases could significantly reduce demand for our products or availability of raw materials; perceived adverse effects on human health linked to the consumption of food derived from animals that utilize our products could cause a decline in the sales of those products; restrictions on the use of antibacterials in food-producing animals may become more prevalent; the potential FDA withdrawal of approval of our Mecadox (carbadox) product; a material portion of our sales and gross profits are generated by antibacterials and other related products; competition in each of our markets from a number of large and small companies, some of which have greater financial, research and development R D ), production and other resources than we have; our business may be negatively affected by weather conditions and the availability of natural resources; the negative effects of a pandemic, epidemic, or outbreak of an infectious disease in humans, such as COVID-19, on our business, financial results, manufacturing facilities and supply chain, as well as our customers, protein processors and markets; climate change could have a material adverse impact on our operations and our customers businesses; actions of regulatory bodies, including obtaining approvals related to the testing, manufacturing and marketing of certain of our products; the continuing trend toward consolidation of certain customer groups as well as the emergence of large buying groups; our ability to control costs and expenses; any unforeseen material loss or casualty;

 the risk of work stoppages; and other factors as described in Risk Factors in Item 1A of our Annual Report. 
 While we believe that our assumptions are reasonable, we caution that it is very difficult to predict the impact of known factors, and it is impossible for us to anticipate all factors that could affect our actual results. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations, or cautionary statements, are disclosed under Risk Factors and Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. All forward-looking statements are expressly qualified in their entirety by these cautionary statements. You should evaluate all forward-looking statements made in this report in the context of these risks and uncertainties. We caution you that the important factors referenced above may not contain all of the factors that are important to you. In addition, we cannot assure you that we will realize the results or developments we expect or anticipate or, even if substantially realized, that they will result in the consequences we anticipate or affect us or our operations in the way we expect. The forward-looking statements included in this report are made only as of the date hereof. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as otherwise required by law. If we do update one or more forward-looking statements, no inference should be made that we will make additional updates with respect to those or other forward-looking statements. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk In the normal course of operations, we are exposed to market risks arising from adverse changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices. As a result, future earnings, cash flows and fair values of assets and liabilities are subject to uncertainty. We use, from time to time, foreign currency contracts and interest rate swaps as a means of hedging exposure to foreign currency risks and fluctuating interest rates, respectively. We do not utilize derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes. We do not hedge our exposure to market risks in a manner that eliminates the effects of changing market conditions on earnings, cash flows and fair values. We monitor the financial stability and credit standing of our major counterparties. For financial market risks related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates, reference is made to the Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Qualitative and Quantitative Disclosures about Market Risk section in the Annual Report and to the notes to the consolidated financial statements included therein. As of the date of this report, there were no material changes in the Company s financial market risks from the risks disclosed in the Annual Report. Item 4. Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures An evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended). Based upon that evaluation as of September 30, 2024, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer each concluded that, as of the end of such period, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There were no changes that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2024.
