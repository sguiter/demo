 On June 26, 2024, we effected a -for-1 stock split of our common stock and proportionately increased the number of authorized shares of common stock. All share and per share information, including share-based compensation, throughout this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q has been retroactively adjusted to reflect the stock split. The shares of common stock retain a par value of per share. Accordingly, an amount equal to the par value of the additional shares issued in the stock split was reclassified from capital in excess of par value to common stock. In the second quarter of 2024 we retired all treasury stock owned, which was recognized as a deduction from common stock for the shares' par value and the excess of cost over par as a deduction from retained earnings. All shares of common stock that we repurchase will be immediately retired and no longer held as treasury stock. 
 We have prepared the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles for interim financial statements and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission. In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments consisting of normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of our financial position and results of operations. Interim results of operations are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for the full year. The financial statements and related notes do not include all information and footnotes required by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles for annual reports. This quarterly report should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements, footnotes and management s discussion and analysis included in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

 . In addition, a portion of gift cards are not expected to be redeemed and will be recognized as breakage over time in proportion to gift card redemptions gift card breakage rate ). The gift card breakage rate is based on company and program specific information, including historical redemption patterns, and expected remittance to government agencies under unclaimed property laws, if applicable. We evaluate our gift card breakage rate estimate annually, or more frequently as circumstances warrant, and apply that rate to gift card redemptions. Gift card liability balances are typically highest at the end of each calendar year following increased gift card sales during the holiday season; accordingly, revenue recognized from gift card liability balances is highest in the first quarter of each calendar year. 

Chipotle Rewards 
 We have a loyalty program called Chipotle Rewards. Customers who enroll in the program generally earn points for every dollar spent. We may also periodically offer promotions, which typically provide the customer with the opportunity to earn bonus points or other rewards. Customers may redeem earned points for various rewards, which are primarily comprised of free food and beverage items. Earned rewards generally expire to after they are issued, and points generally expire if an account is inactive for a period of . 
 We defer revenue associated with the estimated selling price of points or rewards earned by customers as each point or reward is earned, net of points or rewards we do not expect to be redeemed. The estimated selling price of each point or reward earned is based on the estimated value of the product for which the reward is expected to be redeemed. Our estimate of points and rewards we expect to be redeemed is based on historical and other company specific data. The costs associated with rewards redeemed are primarily included in food, beverage, and packaging on our condensed consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income. We evaluate Chipotle Rewards point breakage annually, or more frequently as circumstances warrant. 
 We recognize revenue associated with Chipotle Rewards within food and beverage revenue on the condensed consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income when a customer redeems an earned reward. Deferred revenue associated with Chipotle Rewards is included in unearned revenue on our condensed consolidated balance sheets.

 Rabbi Trust 
 We have elected to fund certain deferred compensation plan obligations through a rabbi trust, the assets of which are designated as trading securities. The rabbi trust is subject to creditor claims in the event of insolvency, but the assets held in the rabbi trust are not available for general corporate purposes. Amounts in the rabbi trust are invested in mutual funds, consistent with the investment choices selected by participants in their Deferred Plan accounts, which are designated as trading securities, carried at fair value and are included in other assets on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. We record trading gains and losses, along with the offsetting amount related to the increase or decrease in deferred compensation to reflect our exposure to liabilities for payment under the deferred plan in general and administrative expenses on the condensed consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income. 
 Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis 
 Assets recognized or disclosed at fair value on the condensed consolidated financial statements on a nonrecurring basis include items such as leasehold improvements, property and equipment, certain long-term investments, operating lease assets, other assets, and goodwill. These assets are measured at fair value whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable or if there has been an observable price change of a non-marketable equity security. 
 During the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, nonrecurring fair value measurements resulting in asset impairments were not material.

We use words such as anticipate , believe , could , should , may , approximately , estimate , expect , intend , project , target , "goal" and similar terms and phrases, including references to assumptions, to identify forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements in this report are based on currently available operating, financial and competitive information available to us as of the date of this filing and we assume no obligation to update these forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in the statements, including but not limited to: increasing wage inflation, including as a result of state or local regulations mandating higher minimum wages, and the competitive labor market, which impacts our ability to attract and retain qualified employees and has resulted in occasional staffing shortages; the impact of any union organizing efforts and our responses to such efforts; increasing supply costs; risks of food safety incidents and food-borne illnesses; risks associated with our reliance on certain information technology systems and potential material failures, interruptions or outages; privacy and cyber security risks, including risk of breaches, unauthorized access, theft, modification, destruction or ransom of guest or employee personal or confidential information stored on our network or the network of third party providers; the impact of competition, including from sources outside the restaurant industry; the impact of federal, state or local government regulations relating to our employees, employment practices, restaurant design and construction, and the sale of food or alcoholic beverages; our ability to achieve our planned growth, such as the costs and availability of suitable new restaurant sites, construction materials and contractors; the expected costs and risks related to our international expansion, including through licensed restaurants in the Middle East; increases in ingredient and other operating costs due to inflation, global conflicts, severe weather and climate change, our Food with Integrity philosophy, tariffs or trade restrictions; intermittent supply shortages relating to our Food with Integrity philosophy, rapid expansion and supply chain disruptions; the uncertainty of our ability to achieve expected levels of comparable restaurant sales due to factors such as changes in guests' perceptions of our brand, including as a result of negative publicity or social media posts, decreased consumer spending (including as a result of higher inflation, mass layoffs, fear of possible recession and higher energy prices), or the inability to increase menu prices or realize the benefits of menu price increases; risks associated with our digital business, including risks arising from our reliance on third party delivery services and the IT infrastructure; litigation risks, including possible governmental actions and potential class action litigation related to food safety incidents, cybersecurity incidents, employment or privacy laws, advertising claims, contract disputes or other matters; and other risk factors described from time to time in our SEC reports, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, and in other reports filed with the SEC, all of which are available on the investor relations page of our website at ir.Chipotle.com.

We believe these metrics are useful to investors because management uses these metrics to assess the growth of our business and the effectiveness of our marketing and operational strategies: 
 Comparable restaurant sales 
 Food, beverage, and packaging as a percentage of total revenue 
 Labor as a percentage of total revenue 
 Occupancy as a percentage of total revenue 
 Other operating costs as a percentage of total revenue 
 New restaurant openings 
 
 Third Quarter 2024 Financial Highlights, year-over-year: 
 Total revenue increased 13.0 to 2.8 billion 
 Comparable restaurant sales increased 6.0 
 Diluted earnings per share was 0.28, a 21.7 increase from 0.23, which includes a 0.01 after-tax net benefit in stock-based compensation expense due to unvested equity awards forfeited by our former CEO and related retention equity awards granted to key executives, an unrealized gain on a long-term investment, and an impairment charge related to a software asset.

 Sales Trends . Comparable restaurant sales increased 6.0 for the three months ended September 30, 2024. The increase is attributable to higher transactions of 3.3 and a 2.7 increase in average check. Comparable restaurant sales represent the change in period-over-period total revenue for restaurants in operation for at least 13 full calendar months. Digital sales represented 34.0 of total food and beverage revenue. 
 Restaurant Development. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we opened 86 company-operated restaurants, which included 73 restaurants with a Chipotlane. We are on track to open approximately 285 to 315 new company-operated restaurants in 2024 and expect to open approximately 315 to 345 new company-operated restaurants in 2025, which assumes utility, construction, permit and inspection delays do not worsen. We expect that at least 80 of our new company-operated restaurants will include a Chipotlane. 
 Licensing. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we opened one licensed restaurant in Kuwait in partnership with international licensed retail operator Alshaya Group. 
 Cultivate Next Fund. Our Cultivate Next Fund is a venture formed to make early-stage investments into strategically aligned companies that further our mission to Cultivate a Better World. The Fund has a size of 100.0 million, which is financed almost entirely by Chipotle. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we made 28.0 million in investments through this Fund.

 Food, beverage and packaging costs increased 0.9 as a percentage of total revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was due to inflation across several ingredient costs, primarily avocados and dairy, higher usage of ingredients as we focused on ensuring consistent and generous portions, and a protein mix shift from the Smoked Brisket limited time offering. This increase was partially offset by a 1.2 benefit from menu price increases in the prior year.

 Impairment, closure costs, and asset disposals decreased in dollar terms for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to higher charges related to the replacement of certain leasehold improvements in the comparable period.

 Interest and other income, net increased in dollar terms for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 , primarily due to increased interest income on our investments in U.S. Treasury securities, money market funds and time deposits due to a higher average investment balance and higher interest rates.

 The effective income tax rate remained flat for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The nine months ended September 30, 2024, had a 0.6 decrease in tax benefits related to option exercises and equity vesting and a 0.3 decrease in return to provision benefit in 2023 versus 2024, partially offset by a 0.5 decrease in tax reserves and 0.4 reduction in nondeductible expenses. 
 
 Seasonality 
 Seasonal factors cause our profitability to fluctuate from quarter to quarter. Historically, our average daily restaurant sales and net income are lower in the first and fourth quarters due, in part, to the holiday season and because fewer people eat out during periods of inclement weather (the winter months) than during periods of mild or warm weather (the spring, summer and fall months). Other factors also have a seasonal effect on our results. For example, restaurants located near colleges and universities generally do more business during the academic year. Seasonal factors, however, might be moderated or outweighed by other factors that may influence our quarterly results, such as unexpected publicity impacting our business in a positive or negative way, worldwide health pandemics, impact of inflation on consumer spending, fluctuations in food or packaging costs, or the timing of menu price increases or promotional activities and other marketing initiatives. The number of trading days in a quarter can also affect our results, although, on an overall annual basis, changes in trading days do not have a significant impact. 
 Our quarterly results are also affected by other factors such as the amount and timing of non-cash stock-based compensation expense and related tax rate impacts, litigation, settlement costs and related legal expenses, impairment charges and non-operating costs, timing of marketing or promotional expenses, the number and timing of new restaurants opened in a quarter, and closure of restaurants. New restaurants typically have higher operating costs following opening because of the expenses associated with their opening and operating inefficiencies in the months immediately following opening. Accordingly, results for a particular quarter are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for any other quarter or for any year.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Cash and Investments 
 As of September 30, 2024 , we had a cash and marketable investments balance of 2.2 billion , non-marketable investments of 85.4 million and 28.0 million of restricted cash. After funding the current operations in our restaurants and support centers, the first planned use of our cash flow from operations is to provide capital for the continued investment in new restaurant construction. In addition to continuing to invest in our restaurant expansion, we expect to utilize cash flow from operations to: repurchase additional shares of our common stock subject to market conditions; invest in, maintain, and refurbish our existing restaurants; and for general corporate purposes. As of September 30, 2024 , 1,059.6 million remained available for repurchases of shares of our common stock. Under the remaining repurchase authorizations, shares may be purchased from time to time in open market transactions, subject to market conditions. 
 Borrowing Capacity 
 As of September 30, 2024 , we had 500.0 million of undrawn borrowing capacity under a line of credit facility. 
 Use of Cash 
 We believe that cash from operations, together with our cash and investment balances, will be sufficient to meet ongoing capital expenditures, working capital requirements and other cash needs for the foreseeable future. Assuming no significant declines in comparable restaurant sales, we expect we will generate positive cash flow for the foreseeable future. 
 We have not required significant working capital because customers generally pay using cash or credit and debit cards and because our operations do not require significant receivables, nor do they require significant inventories due, in part, to our use of various fresh ingredients. In addition, we generally have the right to pay for the purchase of food, beverages and supplies sometime after the receipt of those items, generally within ten days, thereby reducing the need for incremental working capital to support our growth. 
 
 Cash Flows 
 Cash provided by operating activities was 1.6 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 1.5 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to higher net earnings and, to a lesser extent, net cash changes in non-tax operating assets and liabilities. This increase was partially offset by timing of tax-related payments. 
 Cash used in investing activities was 701.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 794.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The change was primarily associated with a 124.4 million decrease in investment purchases net of investment maturities. This was partially offset by increased capital expenditures of 31.9 million primarily related to new restaurant development. 
 Cash used in financing activities was 735.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 505.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The change was primarily due to increased repurchases of common stock of 225.3 million. 
 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 Critical accounting estimates are those that we believe are both significant and that require us to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often because we need to estimate the effect of inherently uncertain matters. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experiences and various other factors that we believe to be appropriate under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates, and we might obtain different estimates if we used different assumptions or factors. We had no significant changes to our critical accounting estimates as described in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

 ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 Commodity Price Risks 
 We are exposed to commodity price risks. Many of the ingredients we use to prepare our food, as well as our packaging materials and utilities to run our restaurants, are ingredients or commodities that are affected by the price of other commodities, exchange rates, foreign demand, weather, seasonality, production, availability and other factors outside our control. We work closely with our suppliers and use a mix of forward pricing protocols under which we agree with our supplier on fixed prices for deliveries at some time in the future, fixed pricing protocols under which we agree on a fixed price with our supplier for the duration of that protocol, formula pricing protocols under which the prices we pay are based on a specified formula related to the prices of the goods, such as spot prices or based on changes in industry indices, and range forward protocols under which we agree on a price range for the duration of that protocol. Generally, our pricing protocols with suppliers can remain in effect for periods ranging from one to 24 months, depending on the outlook for prices of the particular ingredient. In some cases, we have minimum purchase obligations. We have tried to increase, where practical, the number of suppliers for our ingredients, which we believe can help mitigate pricing volatility, and we follow industry news, trade issues, exchange rates, foreign demand, weather, crises and other world events that may affect our ingredient prices. Increases in ingredient prices could adversely affect our results if we choose for competitive or other reasons not to increase menu prices at the same rate at which ingredient costs increase, or if menu price increases result in customer resistance. We also could experience shortages of key ingredients for many unforeseen reasons, such as crop damage due to inclement weather, if our suppliers need to close or restrict operations, or due to industry-wide shipping and freight delays. 
 Changing Interest Rates 
 We are exposed to interest rate risk through fluctuations of interest rates on our investments. As of September 30, 2024, we had 2.3 billion in cash and cash equivalents, current and long-term investments, and restricted cash, of which the substantial majority are interest bearing. Changes in interest rates affect the interest income we earn, and therefore impact our cash flows and results of operations. 
 Foreign Currency Exchange Risk 
 A portion of our operations consist of activities outside of the U.S. and we have currency risk on the transactions in other currencies and translation adjustments resulting from the conversion of our international financial results into the U.S. dollar. However, a substantial majority of our operations and investment activities are transacted in the U.S., and therefore our foreign currency risk is not material at this date. 
 
 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )) that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 As of September 30, 2024, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on the foregoing, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There were no changes during the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024 in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.
