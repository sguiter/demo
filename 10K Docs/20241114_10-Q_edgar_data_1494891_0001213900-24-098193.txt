INTRODUCTORY NOTE 

Forward-Looking Statements 

This report includes statements that are, or may
be deemed, forward-looking statements. In some cases, these statements can be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology
such as believes, estimates, anticipates, expects, plans, intends, 
 may, could, might, will, should, approximately, or
 potential, or negative or other variations of those terms or comparable terminology, although not all forward-looking statements
contain these words. 

Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties
because they relate to events, developments, and circumstances relating to Sensus Healthcare, Inc., our industry, and/or general economic
or other conditions that may or may not occur in the future or may occur on longer or shorter timelines or to a greater or lesser degree
than anticipated. In addition, even if future events, developments and circumstances are consistent with the forward-looking statements
contained in this report, they may not be predictive of results or developments in future periods. Although we believe that we have a
reasonable basis for each forward-looking statement contained in this report, forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future
performance, and our actual results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, and the development of the industry in which we
operate, may differ materially from the forward-looking statements contained in this report as a result of the following factors, among
others: the level and availability of government and/or third party payor reimbursement for clinical procedures using our products, and
the willingness of healthcare providers to purchase our products if the level of reimbursement declines; concentration of our customers
in the U.S. and China, including the concentration of sales to one particular customer in the U.S; the development by others of new products,
treatments, or technologies that render our technology partially or wholly obsolete; the regulatory requirements applicable to us and
our competitors; our ability to efficiently manage our manufacturing processes and costs; the risks arising from doing business in China
and other foreign countries; legislation, regulation, or other governmental action that affects our products, taxes, international trade
regulation, or other aspects of our business; the performance of the Company s information technology systems and its ability to
maintain data security; our ability to obtain and maintain the intellectual property needed to adequately protect our products, and our
ability to avoid infringing or otherwise violating the intellectual property rights of third parties; and other risks described from time
to time in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 

To date, the Russian invasion of Ukraine, conditions
in the Middle East, and other global geopolitical uncertainties have not had significant impacts on our business, but we continue to monitor
developments and will address them in future disclosures, if applicable. 

Any forward-looking statements that we make in
this report speak only as of the date of such statement, and we undertake no obligation to update such statements to reflect events or
circumstances after the date of this report, except as may be required by applicable law.

Three months ended September 30, 2024 compared
to the three months ended September 30, 2023 

Revenues. Revenues were 8.8
million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 3.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, an increase
of 4.9 million, or 125.6 . The increase was primarily driven by a higher number of units sold to a large customer in the three months
ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. 

Cost of sales. Cost of sales
was 3.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 1.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023,
an increase of 1.7 million, or 89.5 . The increase in cost of sales was primarily related to a higher number of units sold and was fairly
consistent as a percentage of revenue in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. 

17 

Gross profit. Gross profit was
 5.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, an
increase of 3.2 million, or 160.0 . Our overall gross profit percentage was 59.1 in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared
to 51.3 in the corresponding period in 2023. The increase in gross profit was primarily driven by a higher number of units sold in the
three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. 

Selling and marketing. Selling
and marketing expense was 1.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

and administrative expense was 1.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 1.5 million for the three months
ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 0.1 million, or 6.7 . The net increase in general and administrative expense was primarily due
to higher compensation and bad debt expense, which were offset by a reduction in bank fees. 

Research and development. Research
and development expense was 0.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 1.1 million for the three months ended
September 30, 2023, a decrease of 0.2 million, or 18.2 . T he decrease was primarily due to expenses
related to a project to develop a drug delivery system for aesthetic use, as most of the development expenses occurred in the 2023 period. 

Other income. Other income of 0.3 million
for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 relate primarily to interest income. 

Nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared

million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 11.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, an increase

Cost of sales. Cost of sales
was 11.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 5.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023,
an increase of 5.8 million, or 103.6 . The increase in cost of sales was primarily related to a higher number of units sold in the nine
months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

Gross profit. Gross profit was
 17.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 6.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, an increase
of 11.1 million, or 179.0 . Our overall gross profit percentage was 60.3 in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 52.5 
in the corresponding period in 2023. The increase in gross profit was primarily driven by a higher number of units sold in the nine months
ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

Selling and marketing. Selling
and marketing expense was 3.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 5.0 million for the nine months ended
September 30, 2023, a decrease of 1.4 million, or 28.0 . The decrease was primarily attributable to the decrease in marketing agency

ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 0.5 million, or 11.9 . The net increase in general and administrative expense was primarily

September 30, 2023, a decrease of 0.3 million, or 10.0 . T he decrease was primarily due

Other income. Other income of 0.7 and
0.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, relate primarily to interest income. 

Financial Condition 

The following discussion summarizes
significant changes in assets and liabilities. Please see the condensed consolidated balance sheets as of September 30, 2024 and December
31, 2023 contained in Part I, Item 1 of this filing. 

Assets 

Cash and cash equivalents at September
30, 2024 decreased 0.5 million from December 31, 2023. See Cash Flows for details on the change in cash and cash equivalents during
the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

Accounts receivable at September 30,
2024 increased 6.4 million from December 31, 2023, primarily due to the increase in sales and concentration of sales to the Company s
primary customer that is subject to extended payment terms. 

Inventories at September 30, 2024 increased
 0.1 million from December 31, 2023, as volume has been increased in anticipation of increasing future revenues. 

Liabilities 

There were no borrowings outstanding under our revolving line of credit
with Comerica Bank at September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

In general terms, liquidity is a measurement of
the Company s ability to meet its cash needs. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, funding was derived primarily from
cash generated by the sale of equipment to our customers in the ordinary course of business. The Company believes that proceeds from maturing
cash equivalents, as well as the Company s borrowing capacity under its existing line of credit and access to capital resources
are sufficient to meet operating capital and funding requirements for the next 12 months from the date of this quarterly report. Please
see Note 3, Debt, to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion regarding the Company s revolving credit facility with
Comerica Bank. The Company s liquidity position and capital requirements may be impacted by a number of factors, including the following: 

ability to generate and increase revenue; 

fluctuations in gross margins, operating expenses and net
results; and 

financial market instability or disruptions to the banking
system due to bank failures 

The Company s primary short-term capital
needs, which are subject to change, include expenditures related to: 

expansion of sales and marketing activities; and 

expansion of research and development activities. 

Sensus s management regularly
evaluates cash requirements for current operations, commitments, capital requirements and business development transactions, and may seek
to raise additional funds for these purposes in the future. However, there can be no assurance that it will be able to raise such funds
or the terms on which such funds may be raised, if at all.

Inflation 

During the first
three quarters of 2024, we continued to experience some increase in commodity and shipping prices and energy and labor costs which resulted
in inflationary pressures across various parts of our business and operations, including on our customers, partners, and suppliers. We
continue to monitor the impact of inflation and we are taking actions, such as ordering inventory in advance, to minimize its effects
on our product cost and sales.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 

The preparation of the condensed consolidated
financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed consolidated financial statements
and the reported amounts of revenue and expense during the reporting periods. Management has identified certain accounting policies as
critical to understanding the financial condition and results of operations. For a detailed discussion on the application of these and
other accounting policies, see the Note 1 , Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the consolidated financial
statements included in the 2023 Annual Report for further information. 

Item 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES
ABOUT MARKET RISK 

Not applicable. 

Item 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation of Disclosure Control and Procedures 

As of September 30, 2024, the end of the period
covered by this Form 10-Q, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness
of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934). Based
upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer each concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, the end of
the period covered by this Form 10-Q, we did not maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures, as described below. 

Information
technology general controls were not designed and operating effectively to ensure that access to applications and data were adequately
restricted to appropriate personnel, ensure segregation of duties, and appropriately monitor the activities of the individuals with access
to modify data. 

While the deficiencies described above did not
result in any material misstatements to the Company s condensed consolidated financial statements for the period ending September
30, 2024, they did represent a material weakness as of September 30, 2024, since there existed a reasonable possibility that a material
misstatement of the Company s annual or interim financial statements would not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. 

Management s Remediation Measures 

To address the material weakness described above,
the Company has implemented new and enhanced controls designed to: ensure that access to information technology applications and data
are adequately restricted to appropriate personnel, ensure segregation of duties, and appropriately monitor the activities of the individuals
with access to modify data. We believe the actions described above will be sufficient to remediate the identified material weakness and
strengthen our internal control over financial reporting. However, the new and enhanced controls have not operated for a sufficient amount
of time to conclude that the material weakness has been remediated. We will continue to monitor the effectiveness of these controls and
will make any further changes management determines to be appropriate. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial
Reporting 

Except for the remediation efforts described above,
there have been no significant changes in our internal control over financial reporting during our most recently completed fiscal quarter
that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Item 1. Legal Proceedings

legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business. The Company assesses, in conjunction with its legal counsel, the need to record

In addition to the other information
set forth in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, you should carefully consider the factors discussed in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors 
in our 2023 Annual Report, as updated in our subsequent quarterly reports. The risks described in our 2023 Annual Report and our subsequent
