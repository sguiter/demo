 EXPLANATORY NOTE This report combines the quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for the period ended September 30, 2024 of CubeSmart (the Parent Company or CubeSmart and CubeSmart, L.P. (the Operating Partnership ). The Parent Company is a Maryland real estate investment trust REIT that owns its assets and conducts its operations through the Operating Partnership, a Delaware limited partnership, and subsidiaries of the Operating Partnership. The Parent Company, the Operating Partnership and their consolidated subsidiaries are collectively referred to in this report as the Company . In addition, terms such as we , us or our used in this report may refer to the Company, the Parent Company or the Operating Partnership. The Parent Company is the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership and, as of September 30, 2024, owned a 99.5 interest in the Operating Partnership. The remaining 0.5 interest consists of common units of limited partnership interest issued by the Operating Partnership to third parties in exchange for contributions of properties to the Operating Partnership. As the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership, the Parent Company has full and complete authority over the Operating Partnership s day-to-day operations and management. Management operates the Parent Company and the Operating Partnership as one enterprise. The management teams of the Parent Company and the Operating Partnership are identical, and their constituents are officers of both the Parent Company and of the Operating Partnership. There are a few differences between the Parent Company and the Operating Partnership, which are reflected in the note disclosures in this report. The Company believes it is important to understand the differences between the Parent Company and the Operating Partnership in the context of how these entities operate as a consolidated enterprise. The Parent Company is a REIT, whose only material asset is its ownership of the partnership interests of the Operating Partnership. As a result, the Parent Company does not conduct business itself, other than acting as the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership, issuing public equity from time to time and guaranteeing the debt obligations of the Operating Partnership. The Operating Partnership holds substantially all of the assets of the Company and, directly or indirectly, holds the ownership interests in the Company s real estate ventures. The Operating Partnership conducts the operations of the Company s business and is structured as a partnership with no publicly traded equity. Except for net proceeds from equity issuances by the Parent Company, which are contributed to the Operating Partnership in exchange for partnership units, the Operating Partnership generates the capital required by the Company s business through the Operating Partnership s operations, by the Operating Partnership s direct or indirect incurrence of indebtedness or through the issuance of partnership units of the Operating Partnership or equity interests in subsidiaries of the Operating Partnership. The substantive difference between the Parent Company s and the Operating Partnership s filings is the fact that the Parent Company is a REIT with public equity, while the Operating Partnership is a partnership with no publicly traded equity. In the consolidated financial statements, this difference is primarily reflected in the equity (or capital for the Operating Partnership) section of the consolidated balance sheets and in the consolidated statements of equity (or capital). Apart from the different equity treatment, the unaudited consolidated financial statements of the Parent Company and the Operating Partnership are nearly identical. The Company believes that combining the quarterly reports on Form 10-Q of the Parent Company and the Operating Partnership into a single report will: facilitate a better understanding by the investors of the Parent Company and the Operating Partnership by enabling them to view the business as a whole in the same manner as management views and operates the business; remove duplicative disclosures and provide a more straightforward presentation in light of the fact that a substantial portion of the disclosure applies to both the Parent Company and the Operating Partnership; and create time and cost efficiencies through the preparation of one combined report instead of two separate reports.

Table of Contents 
 In order to highlight the differences between the Parent Company and the Operating Partnership, the separate sections in this report for the Parent Company and the Operating Partnership specifically refer to the Parent Company and the Operating Partnership. In the sections that combine disclosures of the Parent Company and the Operating Partnership, this report refers to such disclosures as those of the Company. Although the Operating Partnership is generally the entity that directly or indirectly enters into contracts and real estate ventures and holds assets and debt, reference to the Company is appropriate because the business is one enterprise and the Parent Company operates the business through the Operating Partnership. As general partner with control of the Operating Partnership, the Parent Company consolidates the Operating Partnership for financial reporting purposes, and the Parent Company does not have significant assets other than its investment in the Operating Partnership. Therefore, the assets and liabilities of the Parent Company and the Operating Partnership are the same on their respective consolidated financial statements. The separate discussions of the Parent Company and the Operating Partnership in this report should be read in conjunction with each other to understand the results of the Company s operations on a consolidated basis and how management operates the Company. This report also includes separate Item 4 - Controls and Procedures sections, signature pages and Exhibits 31 and 32 certifications for each of the Parent Company and the Operating Partnership, in order to establish that the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer of the Parent Company and the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer of the Operating Partnership have made the requisite certifications and that the Parent Company and the Operating Partnership are compliant with Rule 13a-15 or Rule 15d-15 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and 18 U.S.C. 1350.

NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS states throughout the United States, which are presented under reportable segment: the Company owns, operates, develops, manages and acquires self-storage properties. As of September 30, 2024, the Parent Company owned approximately of the partnership interests OP Units or common units of the Operating Partnership. The remaining OP Units, consisting exclusively of limited partner interests, are held by persons who contributed their interests in properties to the Operating Partnership in exchange for OP Units. Under the partnership agreement, these persons have the right to tender their OP Units for redemption to the Operating Partnership at any time following a specified restricted period for cash equal to the fair value of an equivalent number of common shares of the Parent Company. In lieu of delivering cash, however, the Parent Company, as the Operating Partnership s general partner, may, at its option, choose to acquire any OP Units so tendered by issuing common shares in exchange for the tendered OP Units. If the Parent Company so chooses, its common shares will be exchanged for OP Units on a -for-one basis. This -for-one exchange ratio is subject to adjustment to prevent dilution. With each such exchange or redemption, the Parent Company s percentage ownership in the Operating Partnership will increase. In addition, whenever the Parent Company issues common or other classes of its shares, it contributes the net proceeds it receives from the issuance to the Operating Partnership and the Operating Partnership issues to the Parent Company an equal number of OP Units or other partnership interests having preferences and rights that mirror the preferences and rights of the shares issued. This structure is commonly referred to as an umbrella partnership REIT or UPREIT. The Company typically experiences seasonal fluctuations in the occupancy levels of its stores, which are generally slightly higher during the summer months due to increased moving activity.

The Interest Rate Swaps qualified and were designated as cash flow hedges. Accordingly, the Interest Rate Swaps were recorded on the Company s consolidated balance sheets at fair value and the related gains or losses were deferred in shareholders equity as accumulated other comprehensive income or loss. These deferred gains and losses were amortized into interest expense during the period or periods in which the related interest payments affected earnings.

Litigation From time to time, the Company is involved in claims which arise in the ordinary course of business. In accordance with applicable accounting guidance, management establishes an accrued liability for claim expenses, insurance retention and litigation costs when those matters present loss contingencies that are both probable and reasonably estimable. In such cases, there may be exposure to loss in excess of those amounts accrued. The estimated loss, if any, is based upon currently available information and is subject to significant judgment, a variety of assumptions, and known and unknown uncertainties.

 ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this Report. Some of the statements we make in this section are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. For a discussion of forward-looking statements, see the section in this Report entitled Forward-Looking Statements. Certain risk factors may cause actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied by the following discussion. For a complete discussion of such risk factors, see the section entitled Risk Factors in the Parent Company s and Operating Partnership s combined Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 . Overview We are an integrated self-storage real estate company, and as such we have in-house capabilities in the operation, design, development, leasing, management and acquisition of self-storage properties. The Parent Company s operations are conducted solely through the Operating Partnership and its subsidiaries. The Parent Company has elected to be taxed as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we owned (or partially owned and consolidated) 615 self-storage properties containing an aggregate of approximately 44.4 million rentable square feet and 611 self-storage properties containing an aggregate of approximately 44.1 million rentable square feet, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, we owned stores in the District of Columbia and the following 24 states: Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Utah and Virginia. In addition, as of September 30, 2024, we managed 893 stores for third parties (including 77 stores containing an aggregate of approximately 5.6 million rentable square feet as part of six separate unconsolidated real estate ventures) bringing the total number of stores we owned and/or managed to 1,508. As of September 30, 2024, we managed stores for third parties in the District of Columbia and the following 40 states: Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Virginia, Washington and Wisconsin. We derive substantially all of our revenue from customers who lease space at our stores and fees earned from managing stores. Therefore, our operating results depend materially on our ability to retain our existing customers and lease our available self-storage cubes to new customers while maintaining and, where possible, increasing our pricing levels. In addition, our operating results depend on the ability of our customers to make required rental payments to us. Our approach to the management and operation of our stores combines centralized marketing, revenue management and other operational support with local operations teams that provide market-level oversight and management. We believe this approach allows us to respond quickly and effectively to changes in local market conditions and maximize revenues by managing rental rates and occupancy levels. We typically experience seasonal fluctuations in the occupancy levels of our stores, which are generally slightly higher during the summer months due to increased moving activity. Our results of operations may be sensitive to changes in overall economic conditions that impact consumer spending, including discretionary spending and moving trends, as well as to increased bad debts due to recessionary pressures. Adverse economic conditions affecting disposable consumer income, such as employment levels, business conditions, inflation, deflation, interest rates, tax rates, fuel and energy costs, and other matters could reduce consumer spending or cause consumers to shift their spending to other products and services. A general reduction in the level of discretionary spending or shifts in consumer discretionary spending could adversely affect our growth and profitability. We continue our focus on maximizing internal growth opportunities and selectively pursuing targeted acquisitions and developments of self-storage properties. We have one reportable segment: we own, operate, develop, manage and acquire self-storage properties.

 Our self-storage properties are located in major metropolitan and suburban areas and have numerous customers per store. No single customer represents a significant concentration of our revenues. Our stores in New York, Florida, California and Texas provided approximately 18 , 14 , 11 and 9 , respectively, of total revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Summary of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Set forth below is a summary of the accounting policies and estimates that management believes are critical to the preparation of the unaudited consolidated financial statements included in this Report. Certain of the accounting policies used in the preparation of these unaudited consolidated financial statements are particularly important for an understanding of the financial position and results of operations presented in this Report. For additional discussion of the Company s significant accounting policies, see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in the Parent Company s and Operating Partnership s combined Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 . These policies require the application of judgment and assumptions by management and, as a result, are subject to a degree of uncertainty. Due to this uncertainty, actual results could differ materially from estimates calculated and utilized by management. Basis of Presentation The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements include all of the accounts of the Company, and its majority-owned and/or controlled subsidiaries. The portion of these entities not owned by the Company is presented as noncontrolling interests as of and during the periods presented. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. When the Company obtains an economic interest in an entity, the Company evaluates the entity to determine if the entity is deemed a variable interest entity VIE ), and if the Company is deemed to be the primary beneficiary, in accordance with authoritative guidance issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB on the consolidation of VIEs. To the extent that the Company (i) has the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the economic performance of the VIE and (ii) has the obligation or rights to absorb the VIE s losses or receive its benefits, then the Company is considered the primary beneficiary. The Company may also consider additional factors included in the authoritative guidance, such as whether or not it is the partner in the VIE that is most closely associated with the VIE. When an entity is not deemed to be a VIE, the Company considers the provisions of additional FASB guidance to determine whether a general partner, or the general partners as a group, controls a limited partnership or similar entity when the limited partners have certain rights. The Company consolidates (i) entities that are VIEs and of which the Company is deemed to be the primary beneficiary and (ii) entities that are non-VIEs which the Company controls and in which the limited partners do not have substantive participating rights, or the ability to dissolve the entity or remove the Company without cause nor substantive participating rights. Self-Storage Properties The Company records self-storage properties at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation on the buildings, improvements, and equipment is recorded on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, which range from five to 39 years. Expenditures for significant renovations or improvements that extend the useful life of assets are capitalized. Repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred. When stores are acquired, the purchase price is allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on estimated relative fair values. Allocations to land, building and improvements and equipment are recorded based upon their respective relative fair values as estimated by management. If appropriate, the Company allocates a portion of the purchase price to an intangible asset attributed to the value of in-place leases. This intangible asset is generally amortized to expense over the expected remaining term of the respective leases. Substantially all of the storage leases in place at acquired stores are at market rates, as the majority of the leases are month-to-month contracts. Accordingly, to date, no portion of the purchase price has been allocated to above- or below-market lease intangibles associated with storage leases assumed at acquisition. Above- or below- market lease intangibles associated with assumed leases in which the Company serves as lessee are recorded as an adjustment to the right-of-use asset and reflect the difference between the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to each in-place lease and management s estimate of fair market lease rates. These amounts are amortized over the term of the lease. To date, no intangible asset has been

 recorded for the value of customer relationships, because the Company does not have any concentrations of significant customers and the average customer turnover is fairly frequent. Long-lived assets classified as held for use are reviewed for impairment when events and circumstances such as declines in occupancy and operating results indicate that there may be an impairment. The carrying value of these long-lived assets is compared to the undiscounted future net operating cash flows, plus a terminal value, attributable to the assets to determine if the store s basis is recoverable. If a store s basis is not considered recoverable, an impairment loss is recorded to the extent the net carrying value of the asset exceeds the fair value. The impairment loss recognized equals the excess of net carrying value over the related fair value of the asset. There were no impairment losses recognized in accordance with these procedures during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The Company considers long-lived assets to be held for sale upon satisfaction of the following criteria: (a) management commits to a plan to sell an asset (or group of assets), (b) the asset is available for immediate sale in its present condition subject only to terms that are usual and customary for sales of such assets, (c) an active program to locate a buyer and other actions required to complete the plan to sell the asset have been initiated, (d) the sale of the asset is probable and transfer of the asset is expected to be completed within one year, (e) the asset is being actively marketed for sale at a price that is reasonable in relation to its current fair value and (f) actions required to complete the plan indicate that it is unlikely that significant changes to the plan will be made or that the plan will be withdrawn. Typically these criteria are all met when the relevant asset is under contract, significant non-refundable deposits have been made by the potential buyer, the assets are immediately available for transfer and there are no contingencies related to the sale that may prevent the transaction from closing. However, each potential transaction is evaluated based on its separate facts and circumstances. Assets classified as held for sale are reported at the lesser of carrying value or fair value less estimated costs to sell and are not depreciated. There were no stores classified as held for sale as of September 30, 2024. Investments in Unconsolidated Real Estate Ventures The Company accounts for its investments in unconsolidated real estate ventures under the equity method of accounting when it is determined that the Company has the ability to exercise significant influence over the venture. Under the equity method, investments in unconsolidated real estate ventures are recorded initially at cost, as investments in real estate entities, and subsequently adjusted for equity in earnings (losses) and cash contributions, less cash distributions and impairments. On a periodic basis, management also assesses whether there are any indicators that the carrying value of the Company s investments in unconsolidated real estate entities may be other than temporarily impaired. An investment is impaired only if the fair value of the investment, as estimated by management, is less than the carrying value of the investment and the decline is other than temporary. To the extent impairment that is other than temporary has occurred, the loss shall be measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over the fair value of the investment, as estimated by management. Fair value is determined through various valuation techniques, including but not limited to, discounted cash flow models, quoted market values and third-party appraisals. There were no impairment losses related to the Company s investments in unconsolidated real estate ventures recognized during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 or 2023. Differences between the Company s net investment in unconsolidated real estate ventures and its underlying equity in the net assets of the ventures are primarily a result of the Company acquiring interests in existing unconsolidated real estate ventures. The Company s net investment in unconsolidated real estate ventures was greater than its underlying equity in the net assets of the unconsolidated real estate ventures by an aggregate of 31.2 million and 31.8 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. These differences are amortized over the lives of the self-storage properties owned by the real estate ventures. This amortization is included in Equity in earnings of real estate ventures within our consolidated statements of operations. Results of Operations The following discussion of our results of operations should be read in conjunction with our unaudited consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto. Historical results set forth in our consolidated statements of

 operations reflect only the existing stores for each period presented and should not be taken as indicative of future operations. We consider our same-store portfolio to consist of only those stores owned and operated on a stabilized basis at the beginning and at the end of the applicable periods presented. We consider a store to be stabilized once it has achieved an occupancy rate that we believe, based on our assessment of market-specific data, is representative of similar self-storage assets in the applicable market for a full year measured as of the most recent January 1 and has not been significantly damaged by natural disaster or undergone significant renovation. We believe that same-store results are useful to investors in evaluating our performance because they provide information relating to changes in store-level operating performance without taking into account the effects of acquisitions, developments or dispositions. As of September 30, 2024, we owned 598 same-store properties and 17 non same-store properties. The non same-store property portfolio results include 2023 and 2024 acquisitions, dispositions, newly developed stores, stores with a significant portion of rentable square footage taken out of service or stores that have not yet reached stabilization as defined above. For analytical presentation, all percentages are calculated using the numbers presented in the unaudited consolidated financial statements contained in this Report.

Revenues Revenues increased from 267.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 270.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 3.0 million, or 1.1 . This increase was primarily attributable to additional revenues from stores acquired or opened in 2023 and 2024 included in our non same-store portfolio, an increase in fee income, increased customer storage protection plan participation at our owned and managed stores, and an increase in property management fee income due to an increase in the number of stores under management. Operating Expenses Property operating expenses increased from 77.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 81.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 4.3 million, or 5.6 . This increase was primarily attributable to an increase in advertising costs within our same-store portfolio and additional expenses from stores acquired or opened in 2023 and 2024 included in our non same-store portfolio. Other (Expense) Income Interest expense on loans decreased from 23.2 million during the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 22.8 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 0.5 million, or 2.0 . The decrease was attributable to a decrease in the average outstanding debt balance and lower interest rates during the 2024 period compared to the 2023 period. The average outstanding debt balance decreased from 3.00 billion during the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 2.94 billion during the three months ended September 30, 2024. The weighted average effective interest rate on our outstanding debt decreased from 3.04 during the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 2.99 for the three months ended September 30, 2024. .

 (1) Realized annual rent per occupied square foot is computed by dividing rental income by the weighted average occupied square feet for the period. Revenues Revenues increased from 785.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 798.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 13.3 million, or 1.7 . This increase was primarily attributable to additional revenues from stores acquired or opened in 2023 and 2024 included in our non same-store portfolio, an increase in fee income, increased customer storage protection plan participation at our owned and managed stores, and an increase in property management fee income due to an increase in the number of stores under management. Operating Expenses Property operating expenses increased from 223.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 242.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 18.5 million, or 8.3 . This increase was primarily attributable to an increase in employee medical coverage, additional expenses from stores acquired or opened in 2023 and 2024 included in our non same-store portfolio, and increases in property taxes and insurance as well as advertising and personnel expense within our same-store portfolio. Other (Expense) Income Interest expense on loans decreased from 70.4 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 68.4 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 2.0 million, or 2.8 . The decrease was attributable to a decrease in the average outstanding debt balance and lower interest rates during the 2024 period compared to the 2023 period. The average outstanding debt balance decreased from 3.03 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 2.97 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The weighted average effective interest rate on our outstanding debt decreased from 3.05 during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 3.01 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

 Equity in earnings of real estate ventures decreased from 4.5 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 1.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 2.8 million, or 62.3 . The decrease was primarily due to distributions in excess of our equity investment in 191 IV CUBE Southeast LLC HVPSE during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. There were no such distributions during the 2024 period. Cash Flows Comparison of the nine months ended September 30, 2024 to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 A comparison of cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 is as follows: 

Nine Months Ended September 30, Net cash provided by (used in): 2024 2023 Change (in thousands) Operating activities 466,408 468,840 (2,432) Investing activities (72,861) (58,532) (14,329) Financing activities (356,409) (409,333) 52,924 Cash provided by operating activities decreased from 468.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 466.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, reflecting a decrease of 2.4 million. The decreased cash flow from operating activities was primarily attributable to decreased net operating income levels in the same-store portfolio in the 2024 period as compared to the corresponding 2023 period. This decrease was partially offset by increased cash flow from stores acquired and developed in 2023 and 2024. Cash used in investing activities increased from 58.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 72.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, reflecting an increase of 14.3 million. This change was primarily the result of a 20.6 million increase in acquisitions of storage properties. We acquired two stores during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, with no acquisitions during the corresponding 2023 period. This increase was partially offset by a 10.7 million decrease in development costs, primarily due to the payment during the 2023 period of a put liability associated with a previously consolidated joint venture. Cash used in financing activities decreased from 409.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 356.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, reflecting a decrease of 52.9 million. This change was primarily the result of a 32.9 million increase in proceeds received from the issuance of common shares due to the sale of 0.6 million common shares through our at-the-market equity program during the 2024 period. There were no such transactions during the 2023 period. The change was also due to a 27.6 million reduction in net repayments on our revolving credit facility during the 2024 period as compared to the corresponding 2023 period. These changes were partially offset by a 14.2 million increase in cash distributions paid to common shareholders and noncontrolling interests in the Operating Partnership due to an increase in the common divided per share/unit. Liquidity and Capital Resources Liquidity Overview Our cash flow from operations has historically been one of our primary sources of liquidity used to fund debt service, distributions and capital expenditures. We derive substantially all of our revenue from customers who lease space at our stores and fees earned from managing stores. Therefore, our ability to generate cash from operations is dependent on the rents and management fees that we are able to charge and collect from our customers and clients. We believe that the properties in which we invest, self-storage properties, are less sensitive than other real estate product types to near-term economic downturns. However, prolonged economic downturns could adversely affect our cash flows from operations.

 In order to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, the Parent Company is required to distribute at least 90 of its REIT taxable income, excluding capital gains, to its shareholders on an annual basis, and must pay federal income tax on undistributed income to the extent it distributes less than 100 of its REIT taxable income. The nature of our business, coupled with the requirement that we distribute a substantial portion of our income on an annual basis, will cause us to have substantial liquidity needs over both the short and long term. Our short-term liquidity needs consist primarily of funds necessary to pay operating expenses associated with our stores, refinancing of certain indebtedness, interest expense and scheduled principal payments on debt, expected distributions to limited partners and shareholders, capital expenditures and the acquisition and development of new stores. These funding requirements will vary from year to year, in some cases significantly. For the remainder of the 2024 fiscal year, we expect recurring capital expenditures to be approximately 3.0 million to 8.0 million, planned capital improvements and store upgrades to be approximately 1.5 million to 6.5 million and costs associated with the development of new stores to be approximately 2.0 to 7.0 million. Our currently scheduled principal payments on our outstanding debt are approximately 0.2 million for the remainder of 2024. Our most restrictive financial covenants limit the amount of additional leverage we can add; however, we believe cash flows from operations, access to equity financing, including through our at-the-market equity program, and available borrowings under our Revolver (defined below) provide adequate sources of liquidity to enable us to execute our current business plan and remain in compliance with our covenants. Our liquidity needs beyond 2024 consist primarily of contractual obligations which include repayments of indebtedness at maturity, as well as potential discretionary expenditures such as (i) non-recurring capital expenditures; (ii) redevelopment of operating stores; (iii) acquisitions of additional stores; and (iv) development of new stores. We will have to satisfy the portion of our needs not covered by cash flow from operations through additional borrowings, including borrowings under our Revolver, sales of common or preferred shares of the Parent Company and common or preferred units of the Operating Partnership and/or cash generated through store dispositions and joint venture transactions. We believe that, as a publicly traded REIT, we will have access to multiple sources of capital to fund our long-term liquidity requirements, including the incurrence of additional debt and the issuance of additional equity. However, we cannot provide any assurance that this will be the case. Our ability to incur additional debt will be dependent on a number of factors, including our degree of leverage, the value of our unencumbered assets and borrowing restrictions that may be imposed by lenders. In addition, dislocation in the United States debt markets may significantly reduce the availability and increase the cost of long-term debt capital, including conventional mortgage financing and commercial mortgage-backed securities financing. There can be no assurance that such capital will be readily available in the future. Our ability to access the equity capital markets will be dependent on a number of factors as well, including general market conditions for REITs and market perceptions of us. As of September 30, 2024, we had approximately 43.5 million in available cash and cash equivalents. In addition, we had approximately 849.4 million of availability for borrowings under our Revolver.

The 50.0 million and 250.0 million tranches were priced at 101.343 and 99.735 , respectively, of the principal amount to yield 3.811 and 4.032 , respectively, to maturity. The combined weighted average effective interest rate of the 2025 notes is 3.994 . The indenture under which the Senior Notes were issued restricts the ability of the Operating Partnership and its subsidiaries to incur debt unless the Operating Partnership and its consolidated subsidiaries comply with a leverage ratio not to exceed 60 and an interest coverage ratio of more than 1.5:1.0 after giving effect to the incurrence of the debt. The indenture also restricts the ability of the Operating Partnership and its subsidiaries to incur secured debt unless the Operating Partnership and its consolidated subsidiaries comply with a secured debt leverage ratio not to exceed 40 after giving effect to the incurrence of the debt. The indenture also contains other financial and customary covenants, including a covenant not to own unencumbered assets with a value less than 150 of the unsecured indebtedness of the Operating Partnership and its consolidated subsidiaries. As of and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Operating Partnership was in compliance with all of the financial covenants under the Senior Notes. Revolving Credit Facility On October 26, 2022, we amended and restated, in its entirety, our unsecured revolving credit agreement (the Second Amended and Restated Credit Facility which, subsequent to the amendment and restatement, is comprised of an 850.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility (the Revolver maturing on February 15, 2027. Under the Second Amended and Restated Credit Facility, pricing on the Revolver is dependent upon our unsecured debt credit ratings and leverage levels. At our current unsecured debt credit ratings and leverage levels, amounts drawn under the Revolver are priced using a margin of 0.775 plus a facility fee of 0.15 over the Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("SOFR") plus a 0.10 SOFR adjustment. As of September 30, 2024, borrowings under the Revolver had an interest rate of 5.99 . Additionally, as of September 30, 2024, 849.4 million was available for borrowing under the Revolver. The available balance under the Revolver is reduced by an outstanding letter of credit of 0.6 million. Under the Second Amended and Restated Credit Facility, our ability to borrow under the Revolver is subject to ongoing compliance with certain financial covenants which include, among other things, (1) a maximum total indebtedness to total asset value of 60.0 , and (2) a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.5:1.0. As of and for the

 three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Operating Partnership was in compliance with all financial covenants of the Second Amended and Restated Credit Facility. At-the-Market Equity Program We maintain an at-the-market equity program that enables us to offer and sell up to 60.0 million common shares through sales agents pursuant to equity distribution agreements (the Equity Distribution Agreements ). During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we sold a total of 0.6 million common shares at an average sales price of 54.20 per share, resulting in net proceeds of 32.8 million, after deducting offering costs. We expect that the proceeds from the 2024 sales under the program will be used to fund the acquisition and development of self-storage properties and for general corporate purposes. As of September 30, 2024, 5.2 million common shares remained available for issuance under the Equity Distribution Agreements. Non-GAAP Financial Measures NOI We define net operating income, which we refer to as NOI , as total continuing revenues less continuing property operating expenses. NOI also can be calculated by adding back to net income (loss): interest expense on loans, loan procurement amortization expense, loss on early extinguishment of debt, acquisition-related costs, equity in losses of real estate ventures, other expense, depreciation and amortization expense, general and administrative expense, and deducting from net income (loss): equity in earnings of real estate ventures, gains from sales of real estate, net, other income, gains from remeasurement of investments in real estate ventures and interest income. NOI is not a measure of performance calculated in accordance with GAAP. We use NOI as a measure of operating performance at each of our stores, and for all of our stores in the aggregate. NOI should not be considered as a substitute for operating income, net income, cash flows provided by operating, investing and financing activities, or other income statement or cash flow statement data prepared in accordance with GAAP. We believe NOI is useful to investors in evaluating our operating performance because: it is one of the primary measures used by our management to evaluate the economic productivity of our stores, including our ability to lease our stores, increase pricing and occupancy and control our property operating expenses; it is widely used in the real estate and self-storage industries to measure the performance and value of real estate assets without regard to various items included in net income that do not relate to or are not indicative of operating performance, such as depreciation and amortization, which can vary depending upon accounting methods and the book value of assets; and it helps our investors to meaningfully compare the results of our operating performance from period to period by removing the impact of our capital structure (primarily interest expense on our outstanding indebtedness) and depreciation of our basis in our assets from our operating results. There are material limitations to using a measure such as NOI, including the difficulty associated with comparing results among more than one company and the inability to analyze certain significant items, including depreciation and interest expense, that directly affect our net income. We compensate for these limitations by considering the economic effect of the excluded expense items independently as well as in connection with our analysis of net income. NOI should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with GAAP, such as total revenues, total operating expenses, and net income.

 FFO Funds from operations FFO is a widely used performance measure for real estate companies and is provided here as a supplemental measure of operating performance. The April 2002 National Policy Bulletin of the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, as amended and restated, defines FFO as net income (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains (or losses) from sales of real estate and related impairment charges, plus real estate depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Management uses FFO as a key performance indicator in evaluating the operations of our stores. Given the nature of our business as a real estate owner and operator, we consider FFO a key measure of our operating performance that is not specifically defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. We believe that FFO is useful to management and investors as a starting point in measuring our operational performance because FFO excludes various items included in net income that do not relate to or are not indicative of our operating performance such as gains (or losses) from sales of real estate, gains from remeasurement of investments in real estate ventures, impairments of depreciable assets, and depreciation, which can make periodic and peer analyses of operating performance more difficult. Our computation of FFO may not be comparable to FFO reported by other REITs or real estate companies. FFO should not be considered as an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP) as an indication of our performance. FFO does not represent cash generated from operating activities determined in accordance with GAAP and is not a measure of liquidity or an indicator of our ability to make cash distributions. We believe that to further understand our performance, FFO should be compared with our reported net income and considered in addition to cash flows computed in accordance with GAAP, as presented in our unaudited consolidated financial statements. The following table presents a reconciliation of net income attributable to the Company s common shareholders to FFO attributable to the Company s common shareholders and third-party OP unitholders for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

Market Risk Our investment policy relating to cash and cash equivalents is to preserve principal and liquidity while maximizing returns through the investment of available funds. Effect of Changes in Interest Rates on our Outstanding Debt Our interest rate risk objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate fluctuations on earnings and cash flows and to lower our overall borrowing costs. To achieve these objectives, we may, from time to time, choose to manage our exposure to fluctuations in market interest rates for a portion of our borrowings through the use of derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps or caps to mitigate our interest rate risk on a related financial instrument or to effectively lock the interest rate on a portion of our variable-rate debt. The analysis below presents the sensitivity of the market value of our financial instruments to selected changes in market interest rates. The range of changes chosen 

 42 

Table of Contents 
 reflects our view of changes which are reasonably possible over a one-year period. Market values are the present value of projected future cash flows based on the market interest rates chosen. As of September 30, 2024, our consolidated debt consisted of 2.89 billion of outstanding mortgage loans and notes payable and unsecured senior notes that are subject to fixed rates. Borrowings under our unsecured credit facility are subject to floating rates. Changes in market interest rates have different impacts on the fixed- and variable-rate portions of our debt portfolio. A change in market interest rates on the fixed portion of the debt portfolio impacts the net financial instrument position, but has no impact on interest incurred or cash flows. A change in market interest rates on the variable portion of the debt portfolio impacts the interest incurred and cash flows, but does not impact the net financial instrument position. If market interest rates increase by 100 basis points, the fair value of our outstanding fixed-rate mortgage debt and unsecured senior notes would decrease by approximately 109.7 million. If market interest rates decrease by 100 basis points, the fair value of our outstanding fixed-rate mortgage debt and unsecured senior notes would increase by approximately 114.9 million. ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURE S Controls and Procedures (Parent Company) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures As of the end of the period covered by this Report, the Parent Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of its management, including its chief executive officer and chief financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act).

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting There has been no change in the Parent Company s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during our most recent fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, its internal control over financial reporting.
