During the thirty-nine-week period ended September 28, 2024, the Company granted RSUs with a performance condition and RSUs with a market condition, as further described below. Outstanding RSUs at both December 30, 2023 and September 28, 2024 include RSUs with a performance condition and RSUs with a market condition, as further described below and in the Company s 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 
 RSUs with a performance condition granted on February 2, 2024 may vest on January 31 of 2027, 2028 and 2029 based on growth in operating income and pre-tax
 income per diluted share from continuing operations as compared to the results from the 2023 fiscal year. 
 On February 2, 2024, the Company granted RSUs that vest based on a market condition. These RSUs may vest based on the achievement of the target Company s total shareholder return TSR compound annual growth rate, adjusted to reflect dividends (if any) paid during such periods and capital adjustments as may be necessary, and are eligible to vest annually starting after the sixth anniversary of the grant date and concluding after the tenth anniversary of the grant date. The fair value of this RSU award was determined at the time of grant based on the expected achievement of the market condition. With respect to these RSU awards, the Company reports compensation expense ratably over the service period of the award based on the number of units granted multiplied by the grant date fair value of the RSU. Previously recognized compensation cost would be reversed only if the employee did not complete the requisite service period due to termination of employment.

 at September 28, 2024

The fair value of each share of non-vested

For restricted stock awards granted under the 2022 DSCP, each recipient may elect to defer receipt of shares and instead receive restricted stock units Deferred Stock Units ), which represent contingent rights to receive shares of the Company s common stock on the date of the recipient s separation from service from the Board of Directors, or, if earlier, upon a change in control event of the Company. Deferred Stock Units become vested on the first anniversary of the date of the grant. Deferred Stock Units do not represent actual ownership in shares of the Company s common stock and the recipient does not have voting rights or other incidents of ownership until the shares are issued. However, Deferred Stock Units do contain the right to receive dividend equivalent payments prior to settlement into shares. 
 As of September 28, 2024, there was of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested

 The Company had issued and outstanding vested or unvested stock options or unrecognized compensation costs related to non-vested

outstanding stock options issued by the Company. For the thirty-nine-week period ended September 30, 2023, the impact on earnings per share of future compensation expense related to outstanding, unvested time-based awards was greater than the incremental impact of outstanding dilutive stock options, and would therefore have an anti-dilutive effect on earnings per share if included in the calculation of earnings per share. Accordingly, the Company had no reconciling items between the average number of common shares outstanding used to calculate basic earnings per common share and the average number of common shares and common share equivalents outstanding used to calculate diluted earnings per share during each of the 2024 and 2023 thirty-nine-week and thirteen-week periods. 
 Outstanding RSUs were excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share for all periods because the performance metric requirements or market condition for vesting had not been 
 satisfied.

 and are carried at fair value. Investments maturing less than one year from the balance sheet date are included in short-term investments and investments maturing more than one year from the balance sheet date are included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets. Management performs an analysis of the nature of the unrealized losses on available-for-sale

 investments to determine whether an allowance for credit loss is necessary. Unrealized losses, representing the excess of the purchase price of an investment over its fair value as of the end of a period, considered to be a result of credit-related factors, are to be included as a charge in the statements of income, while unrealized losses considered to be a result of non-credit-related
 factors are to be included as a component of shareholders equity. Investments whose values are based on quoted market prices in active markets are classified within Level 1. Investments that trade in markets that are not considered to be active, but are valued based on quoted market prices, are classified within Level 2. As Level 2 investments include positions that are not traded in active markets, valuations may be adjusted to reflect illiquidity and/or non-transferability,
 which are generally based on available market information. Any transfers between levels are recognized as of the beginning of any reporting period. Fair value of the bond portfolio was determined using Level 1 inputs related to money market investments and Level 2 inputs related to investment-grade corporate bonds, asset-backed securities, commercial paper and direct obligations of government agencies. Unrealized losses, net of unrealized gains, on the investments in the bond portfolio

The Company believes unrealized losses on investments were primarily caused by rising interest rates rather than changes in credit quality. The Company expects to recover, through collection of all of the contractual cash flows of each security, the amortized cost basis of these securities as it does not intend to sell, and does not anticipate being required to sell, these securities before recovery of the cost basis. For these reasons, no losses have been recognized in the Company s consolidated statements of income.

On , Landstar entered into a second amended and restated credit agreement with a bank syndicate led by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent (as further amended as of June 21, 2024, the Credit Agreement ). The Credit Agreement, which matures July 1, 2027, provides for borrowing capacity in the form of a revolving credit facility of , of which may be utilized in the form of letters of credit. The Credit Agreement also includes an accordion feature providing for a possible increase of up to an aggregate amount of borrowing capacity of . As of September 28, 2024, the Company had borrowings outstanding under the Credit Agreement.

None of these covenants are presently considered by management to be materially restrictive to the Company s operations, capital resources or liquidity. 

 The interest rates on borrowings under the revolving credit facility are typically tied to short-term interest rates and, as such, carrying value approximates fair value. Interest rates on borrowings under finance leases approximate the interest rates that would currently be available to the Company under similar terms and, as such, carrying value approximates fair value.

Introduction Landstar System, Inc. and its subsidiary, Landstar System Holdings, Inc. (collectively referred to herein with their subsidiaries and other affiliated companies as Landstar or the Company ), is a technology-enabled, asset-light provider of integrated transportation management solutions delivering safe, specialized transportation services to a broad range of customers utilizing a network of agents, third party capacity providers and employees. The Company offers services to its customers across multiple transportation modes, with the ability to arrange for individual shipments of freight to comprehensive third party logistics solutions to meet all of a customer s transportation needs. Landstar provides services principally throughout the United States and to a lesser extent in Canada and Mexico, and between the United States and Canada, Mexico and other countries around the world. The Company s services emphasize safety, information coordination and customer service and are delivered through a network of approximately 1,100 independent commission sales agents and over 78,000 third party capacity providers, primarily truck capacity providers, linked together by a series of digital technologies which are provided and coordinated by the Company. The nature of the Company s business is such that a significant portion of its operating costs varies directly with revenue. 
 21 

Landstar markets its integrated transportation management solutions primarily through independent commission sales agents and exclusively utilizes third party capacity providers to transport customers freight. Landstar s independent commission sales agents enter into contractual arrangements with the Company and are responsible for locating freight, making that freight available to Landstar s capacity providers and coordinating the transportation of the freight with customers and capacity providers. The Company s third party capacity providers consist of independent contractors who provide truck capacity to the Company under exclusive lease arrangements (the BCO Independent Contractors ), unrelated trucking companies who provide truck capacity to the Company under non-exclusive contractual arrangements (the Truck Brokerage Carriers ), air cargo carriers, ocean cargo carriers and railroads. Through this network of agents and capacity providers linked together by Landstar s ecosystem of digital technologies, Landstar operates an integrated transportation management solutions business primarily throughout North America with revenue of 5.3 billion during the most recently completed fiscal year. The Company reports the results of two operating segments: the transportation logistics segment and the insurance segment. The transportation logistics segment provides a wide range of integrated transportation management solutions. Transportation services are provided by Landstar s Operating Subsidiaries : Landstar Ranger, Inc., Landstar Inway, Inc., Landstar Ligon, Inc., Landstar Gemini, Inc., Landstar Transportation Logistics, Inc., Landstar Global Logistics, Inc., Landstar Express America, Inc., Landstar Canada, Inc., Landstar Metro, S.A.P.I. de C.V., and Landstar Blue, LLC. Transportation services offered by the Company include truckload, less-than-truckload and other truck transportation, rail intermodal, air cargo, ocean cargo, expedited ground and air delivery of time-critical freight, heavy-haul/specialized, U.S.-Canada and U.S.-Mexico cross-border, intra-Mexico, intra-Canada, project cargo and customs brokerage. Examples of the industries serviced by the transportation logistics segment include automotive parts and assemblies, consumer durables, building products, metals, chemicals, foodstuffs, heavy machinery, retail, electronics and military equipment. In addition, the transportation logistics segment provides transportation services to other transportation companies, including third party logistics and less-than-truckload service providers. The independent commission sales agents market services provided by the transportation logistics segment. Billings for freight transportation services are typically charged to customers on a per shipment basis for the physical transportation of freight and are referred to as transportation revenue. During the thirty-nine weeks ended September 28, 2024, revenue generated by BCO Independent Contractors, Truck Brokerage Carriers and railroads represented approximately 38 , 52 and 2 , respectively, of the Company s consolidated revenue. Collectively, revenue generated by air and ocean cargo carriers represented approximately 6 of the Company s consolidated revenue in the thirty-nine-week period ended September 28, 2024. The insurance segment is comprised of Signature Insurance Company Signature ), a wholly owned offshore insurance subsidiary, and Risk Management Claim Services, Inc. The insurance segment provides risk and claims management services to certain of Landstar s operating subsidiaries. In addition, it reinsures certain risks of the Company s BCO Independent Contractors and provides certain property and casualty insurance directly to certain of Landstar s operating subsidiaries. Revenue at the insurance segment represents reinsurance premiums from third party insurance companies that provide insurance programs to BCO Independent Contractors where all or a portion of the risk is ultimately borne by Signature. Revenue at the insurance segment represented approximately 1 of the Company s consolidated revenue for the thirty-nine-week period ended September 28, 2024. Changes in Financial Condition and Results of Operations Management believes the Company s success principally depends on its ability to generate freight revenue through its network of independent commission sales agents and to deliver freight safely and efficiently utilizing third party capacity providers. Management believes the most significant factors to the Company s success include increasing revenue, sourcing capacity, empowering its network through technology-based tools and controlling costs, including insurance and claims. Revenue While customer demand, which is subject to overall economic conditions, ultimately drives increases or decreases in revenue, the Company primarily relies on its independent commission sales agents to establish customer relationships and generate revenue opportunities. Management s emphasis with respect to revenue growth is on revenue generated by independent commission sales agents who on an annual basis generate 1 million or more of Landstar revenue Million Dollar Agents ). Management believes future revenue growth is primarily dependent on its ability to increase both the revenue generated by Million Dollar Agents and the number of Million Dollar Agents through a combination of recruiting new agents, increasing the revenue opportunities generated by existing independent commission sales agents and providing its independent commission sales agents with digital technologies they may use to grow revenue and increase efficiencies at their businesses. During the 2023 fiscal year, 524 independent commission sales agents generated 1 million or more of Landstar revenue and thus qualified as Million Dollar Agents. During the 2023 fiscal year, the average revenue generated by a Million Dollar Agent was 9,645,000 and revenue generated by Million Dollar Agents in the aggregate represented 95 of consolidated revenue. 
 22 

Management monitors business activity by tracking the number of loads (volume) and revenue per load by mode of transportation. Revenue per load can be influenced by many factors other than a change in price. Those factors include the average length of haul, freight type, special handling and equipment requirements, fuel costs and delivery time requirements. For shipments involving two or more modes of transportation, revenue is generally classified by the mode of transportation having the highest cost for the load. The following table summarizes this information by trailer type for truck transportation and by mode for all others:

 (1) Active refers to Truck Brokerage Carriers who moved at least one load in the 180 days immediately preceding the fiscal quarter end. Purchased transportation represents the amount a BCO Independent Contractor or other third party capacity provider is paid to haul freight. The amount of purchased transportation paid to a BCO Independent Contractor is primarily based on a contractually agreed-upon percentage of revenue generated by loads hauled by the BCO Independent Contractor. Purchased transportation paid to a Truck Brokerage Carrier is based on either a negotiated rate for each load hauled or, to a lesser extent, a contractually agreed-upon fixed rate per load. Purchased transportation paid to railroads and ocean cargo carriers is based on either a negotiated rate for each load hauled or a contractually agreed-upon fixed rate per load. Purchased transportation paid to air cargo carriers is generally based on a negotiated rate for each load hauled. Purchased transportation as a percentage of revenue for truck brokerage, rail intermodal and ocean cargo services is normally higher than that of BCO Independent Contractor and air cargo services. Purchased transportation is the largest component of costs and expenses and, on a consolidated basis, increases or decreases as a percentage of consolidated revenue in proportion to changes in the percentage of consolidated revenue generated through BCO Independent Contractors and other third party capacity providers and external revenue from the insurance segment, consisting of reinsurance premiums. Purchased transportation as a percent of revenue also increases or decreases in relation to the availability of truck brokerage capacity and with changes in the price of fuel on revenue generated from shipments hauled by Truck Brokerage Carriers. The Company passes 100 of fuel surcharges billed to customers for freight hauled by BCO Independent Contractors to its BCO Independent Contractors. These fuel surcharges are excluded from revenue and the cost of purchased transportation. Purchased transportation costs are recognized over the freight transit period as the performance obligation to the customer is completed. Commissions to agents Commissions to agents are based on contractually agreed-upon percentages of (i) revenue, (ii) revenue less the cost of purchased transportation, or (iii) revenue less a contractually agreed upon percentage of revenue retained by Landstar and the cost of purchased transportation (the retention contracts ). Commissions to agents as a percentage of consolidated revenue vary directly with fluctuations in the percentage of consolidated revenue generated by the various modes of transportation and reinsurance premiums and, in general, vary inversely with changes in the amount of purchased transportation as a percentage of revenue on services provided by Truck Brokerage Carriers, railroads, air cargo carriers and ocean cargo carriers. Commissions to agents are recognized over the freight transit period as the performance obligation to the customer is completed. 
 24 

Other operating costs, net of gains on asset sales/dispositions Maintenance costs for Company-provided trailing equipment, the provision for uncollectible advances and other receivables due from BCO Independent Contractors and independent commission sales agents and recruiting and qualification costs for BCO Independent Contractors are the largest components of other operating costs. Also included in other operating costs are trailer rental costs and gains/losses, if any, on sales of Company-owned trailing equipment. Insurance and claims With respect to insurance and claims cost, potential liability associated with accidents in the trucking industry is severe and occurrences are unpredictable. Landstar retains liability through a self-insured retention for commercial trucking claims up to 5 million per occurrence. Effective May 1, 2023, the Company entered into a three year commercial auto liability insurance arrangement for losses incurred between 5 million and 10 million (the 2023 Initial Excess Policy with a third party insurance company. For commercial trucking claims incurred on or after May 1, 2023 through April 30, 2026, the 2023 Initial Excess Policy provides for an aggregate deductible of 18 million over the thirty-six-month term ending April 30, 2026. After payment of the deductible, the 2023 Initial Excess Policy provides for a limit for a single loss of 5 million, with an aggregate limit of 15 million for the thirty-six-month term ending April 30, 2026. The Company also maintains third party insurance arrangements providing excess coverage for commercial trucking liabilities in excess of 10 million. These third party arrangements provide coverage on a per occurrence or aggregated basis. Over the past decade, there has been a significant increase in the occurrence of trials in courts throughout the United States involving catastrophic injury and fatality claims against commercial motor carriers that have resulted in verdicts in excess of 10 million. Within the transportation logistics industry, these verdicts are often referred to as Nuclear Verdicts. The increase in Nuclear Verdicts has had a significant impact on the cost of commercial auto liability claims throughout the United States. Due to the increasing cost of commercial auto liability claims, the availability of excess coverage has significantly decreased, and the pricing associated with such excess coverage, to the extent available, has significantly increased. Since the annual policy year ended April 30, 2020, as compared to the annual policy year ending April 30, 2025, the Company experienced an increase of approximately 22 million, or over 400 , in the premiums charged by third party insurance companies to the Company for excess coverage for commercial trucking liabilities in excess of 10 million. Moreover, the Company from year to year manages the level of its financial exposure to commercial trucking claims in excess of 10 million, including through the use of additional self-insurance, deductibles, aggregate loss limits, quota shares and other arrangements with third party insurance companies, based on the availability of coverage within certain excess insurance coverage layers and estimated cost differentials between proposed premiums from third party insurance companies and historical and actuarially projected losses experienced by the Company at various levels of excess insurance coverage. For example, with respect to a single hypothetical claim in the amount of 65 million incurred during the annual policy year ending April 30, 2025, the Company would have an aggregate financial exposure of approximately 30 million. Furthermore, the Company s third party insurance arrangements provide excess coverage up to an uppermost coverage layer, in excess of which the Company retains additional financial exposure. No assurances can be given that the availability of excess coverage for commercial trucking claims will not continue to deteriorate, that the pricing associated with such excess coverage, to the extent available, will not continue to increase, nor that insurance coverage from third party insurers for excess coverage of commercial trucking claims will even be available on commercially reasonable terms at certain levels. Moreover, the occurrence of a Nuclear Verdict, or the settlement of a catastrophic injury and/or fatality claim that could have otherwise resulted in a Nuclear Verdict, could have a material adverse effect on Landstar s cost of insurance and claims and its results of operations. Further, the Company retains liability of up to 2,000,000 for each general liability claim, 250,000 for each workers compensation claim and up to 250,000 for each cargo claim. In addition, under reinsurance arrangements by Signature of certain risks of the Company s BCO Independent Contractors, the Company retains liability of up to 500,000, 1,000,000 or 2,000,000 with respect to certain occupational accident claims and up to 750,000 with respect to certain workers compensation claims. The Company s exposure to liability associated with accidents incurred by Truck Brokerage Carriers, railroads and air and ocean cargo carriers who transport freight on behalf of the Company is reduced by various factors including the extent to which such carriers maintain their own insurance coverage. A material increase in the frequency or severity of accidents, cargo claims or workers compensation claims or the material unfavorable development of existing claims could have a material adverse effect on Landstar s cost of insurance and claims and its results of operations. 
 25 

Selling, general and administrative During the thirty-nine-week period ended September 28, 2024, employee compensation and benefits accounted for approximately 64 of the Company s selling, general and administrative costs. Employee compensation and benefits include wages and employee benefit costs as well as incentive compensation and stock-based compensation expense. Incentive compensation and stock-based compensation expense is highly variable in nature in comparison to wages and employee benefit costs. Depreciation and amortization Depreciation and amortization primarily relate to depreciation of trailing equipment and information technology hardware and software. Costs of revenue The Company incurs costs of revenue related to the transportation of freight and, to a much lesser extent, to reinsurance premiums received by Signature. Costs of revenue include variable costs of revenue and other costs of revenue. Variable costs of revenue include purchased transportation and commissions to agents, as these costs are entirely variable on a shipment-by-shipment basis. Other costs of revenue include fixed costs of revenue and semi-variable costs of revenue, where such costs may vary over time based on certain economic factors or operational metrics such as the number of Company-controlled trailers, the number of BCO Independent Contractors, the frequency and severity of insurance claims, the number of miles traveled by BCO Independent Contractors, or the number and/or scale of information technology projects in process or in-service to support revenue generating activities, rather than on a shipment-by-shipment basis. Other costs of revenue associated with the transportation of freight include: (i) other operating costs, primarily consisting of trailer maintenance, the provision for uncollectible advances and other receivables due from BCO Independent Contractors and independent commission sales agents and BCO Independent Contractor recruiting and qualification costs, as reported in the Company s Consolidated Statements of Income, (ii) transportation-related insurance premiums paid and claim costs incurred, included as a portion of insurance and claims in the Company s Consolidated Statements of Income, (iii) costs incurred related to internally developed software including ASC 350-40 amortization, implementation costs, hosting costs and other support costs utilized to support the Company s independent commission sales agents, third party capacity providers, and customers, included as a portion of depreciation and amortization and of selling, general and administrative in the Company s Consolidated Statements of Income; and (iv) depreciation on Company-owned trailing equipment, included as a portion of depreciation and amortization in the Company s Consolidated Statements of Income. Other costs of revenue associated with reinsurance premiums received by Signature are comprised of broker commissions and other fees paid related to the administration of insurance programs to BCO Independent Contractors and are included in selling, general and administrative in the Company s Consolidated Statements of Income. In addition to costs of revenue, the Company incurs various other costs relating to its business, including most selling, general and administrative costs and portions of costs attributable to insurance and claims and depreciation and amortization. Management continually monitors all components of the costs incurred by the Company and establishes annual cost budgets that, in general, are used to benchmark costs incurred on a monthly basis. Gross Profit, Variable Contribution, Gross Profit Margin and Variable Contribution Margin The following table sets forth calculations of gross profit, defined as revenue less costs of revenue, and gross profit margin, defined as gross profit divided by revenue, for the periods indicated. The Company refers to revenue less variable costs of revenue as variable contribution and variable contribution divided by revenue as variable contribution margin. Variable contribution and variable contribution margin are each non-GAAP financial measures. The closest comparable GAAP financial measures to variable contribution and variable contribution margin are, respectively, gross profit and gross profit margin. The Company believes variable contribution and variable contribution margin are useful measures of the variable costs that we incur at a shipment-by-shipment level attributable to our transportation network of third-party capacity providers and independent commission sales agents in order to provide services to our customers. The Company believes variable contribution and variable contribution margin are important performance measurements and management considers variable contribution and variable contribution margin in evaluating the Company s financial performance and in its decision-making, such as budgeting for infrastructure, trailing equipment and selling, general and administrative costs.

 Insurance-related costs in the table above include (i) other costs of revenue related to the transportation of freight that are included as a portion of insurance and claims in the Company s Consolidated Statements of Income and (ii) certain other costs of revenue related to reinsurance premiums received by Signature that are included as a portion of selling, general and administrative in the Company s Consolidated Statements of Income. Insurance and claims costs included in other costs of revenue relating to the transportation of freight primarily consist of insurance premiums paid for commercial auto liability, general liability, cargo and other lines of coverage related to the transportation of freight and the related cost of claims incurred under those programs, and, to a lesser extent, the cost of claims incurred under insurance programs available to BCO Independent Contractors that are reinsured by Signature. Other insurance and claims costs included in costs of revenue that are included in selling, general and administrative in the Company s Consolidated Statements of Income consist of brokerage commissions and other fees incurred by Signature relating to the administration of insurance programs available to BCO Independent Contractors that are reinsured by Signature. In general, variable contribution margin on revenue generated by BCO Independent Contractors represents a fixed percentage due to the nature of the contracts that pay a fixed percentage of revenue to both the BCO Independent Contractors and independent commission sales agents. For revenue generated by Truck Brokerage Carriers, variable contribution margin may be either a fixed or variable percentage, depending on the contract with each individual independent commission sales agent. Variable contribution margin on revenue generated from shipments hauled by railroads, air cargo carriers, ocean cargo carriers and Truck Brokerage Carriers, other than those under retention contracts, is variable in nature, as the Company s contracts with independent commission sales agents provide commissions to agents at a contractually agreed upon percentage of the amount represented by revenue less purchased transportation for these types of shipments. Approximately 43 of the Company s consolidated revenue in the thirty-nine-week period ended September 28, 2024 was generated under transactions that pay a fixed percentage of revenue to the third party capacity provider and/or agents while 57 was generated under transactions that pay a variable percentage of revenue to the third party capacity provider and/or agents. Operating income as a percentage of gross profit and operating income as a percentage of variable contribution The following table presents operating income as a percentage of gross profit and operating income as a percentage of variable contribution. The Company s operating income as a percentage of variable contribution is a non-GAAP financial measure calculated as operating income divided by variable contribution. The Company believes that operating income as a percentage of variable contribution is useful and meaningful to investors for the following principal reasons: (i) the variable costs of revenue for a significant portion of the business are highly influenced by short-term market-based trends in the freight transportation industry, whereas other costs, including other costs of revenue, are much less impacted by short-term freight market trends; (ii) disclosure of this measure allows investors to better understand the underlying trends in the Company s results of operations; (iii) this measure is meaningful to investors evaluations of the Company s management of costs attributable to operations other than the purely variable costs associated with purchased transportation and commissions to agents that the Company incurs to provide services to our customers; and (iv) management considers this financial information in its decision-making, such as budgeting for infrastructure, trailing equipment and selling, general and administrative costs.

 The decrease in operating income as a percentage of gross profit from the 2023 thirty-nine-week period to the 2024 thirty-nine-week period and from the 2023 thirteen-week period to the 2024 thirteen-week period resulted from the decrease of operating income at a more rapid percentage rate than the decrease in gross profit, primarily due to the impact of the Company s fixed cost infrastructure, principally certain components of selling, general and administrative costs, in comparison to a smaller gross profit base. The decrease in operating income as a percentage of variable contribution from the 2023 thirty-nine-week period to the 2024 thirty-nine-week period and from the 2023 thirteen-week period to the 2024 thirteen-week period resulted from the decrease of operating income at a more rapid percentage rate than the decrease in variable contribution, primarily due to the impact of the Company s fixed cost infrastructure, principally certain components of selling, general and administrative costs, in comparison to a smaller variable contribution base. Also, as previously mentioned, the Company reports two operating segments: the transportation logistics segment and the insurance segment. External revenue at the insurance segment, representing reinsurance premiums, has historically been relatively consistent on an annual basis at 2 or less of consolidated revenue and generally corresponds directly with the number of trucks provided by BCO Independent Contractors. The discussion of cost line items in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations considers the Company s costs on a consolidated basis rather than on a segment basis. Management believes this presentation format is the most appropriate to assist users of the financial statements in understanding the Company s business for the following reasons: (1) the insurance segment has no other operating costs; (2) discussion of insurance and claims at either segment without reference to the other may create confusion amongst investors and potential investors due to intercompany arrangements and specific deductible programs that affect comparability of financial results by segment between various fiscal periods but that have no effect on the Company from a consolidated reporting perspective; (3) selling, general and administrative costs of the insurance segment comprise less than 10 of consolidated selling, general and administrative costs and have historically been relatively consistent on a year-over-year basis; and (4) the insurance segment has no depreciation and amortization. THIRTY-NINE WEEKS ENDED SEPTEMBER 28, 2024 COMPARED TO THIRTY-NINE WEEKS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2023 Revenue for the 2024 thirty-nine-week period was 3,609,915,000, a decrease of 488,962,000, or 12 , compared to the 2023 thirty-nine-week period. Transportation revenue decreased 481,883,000, or 12 . The decrease in transportation revenue was attributable to a decreased number of loads hauled of approximately 10 and decreased revenue per load of approximately 3 compared to the 2023 thirty-nine-week period. Reinsurance premiums were 47,974,000 and 55,053,000 for the 2024 and 2023 thirty-nine-week periods, respectively. The decrease in revenue from reinsurance premiums was primarily attributable to a decrease in the average number of trucks provided by BCO Independent Contractors in the 2024 thirty-nine-week period compared to the 2023 thirty-nine-week period. 
 28 

Truck transportation revenue generated by BCO Independent Contractors and Truck Brokerage Carriers (together, the third party truck capacity providers for the 2024 thirty-nine-week period was 3,265,745,000, representing 90 of total revenue, a decrease of 478,672,000, or 13 , compared to the 2023 thirty-nine-week period. The number of loads hauled by third party truck capacity providers decreased approximately 10 compared to the 2023 thirty-nine-week period, and revenue per load on loads hauled by third party truck capacity providers decreased approximately 3 in the 2024 thirty-nine-week period compared to the 2023 thirty-nine-week period. The decrease in the number of loads hauled via truck compared to the 2023 thirty-nine-week period was primarily due to a broad-based decrease in demand for the Company s truck transportation services. Loads hauled via other truck transportation services decreased 27 , less-than-truckload loadings decreased 11 , loads hauled via van equipment decreased 8 and loads hauled via unsided/platform equipment decreased 7 as compared to the 2023 thirty-nine-week period. The decrease in revenue per load on loads hauled via truck was primarily due to a softer freight demand environment experienced during the 2024 thirty-nine-week period. Revenue per load on loads hauled via other truck transportation services decreased 12 , on loads hauled via van equipment decreased 5 and on less-than-truckload loadings decreased 3 , while revenue per load on loads hauled via unsided/platform equipment increased 2 as compared to the 2023 thirty-nine-week period. The increase in revenue per load on loads hauled via unsided/platform equipment of 2 was favorably impacted by an increase in the percentage of revenue contributed by heavy/specialized equipment, which typically has a higher revenue per load. Fuel surcharges billed to customers on revenue generated by BCO Independent Contractors are excluded from revenue. Fuel surcharges on Truck Brokerage Carrier revenue identified separately in billings to customers and included as a component of Truck Brokerage Carrier revenue were 89,862,000 and 112,879,000 in the 2024 and 2023 thirty-nine-week periods, respectively. It should be noted that billings to many customers of the Company s truck brokerage services include a single all-in rate that do not separately identify fuel surcharges on loads hauled via Truck Brokerage Carriers. Accordingly, the overall impact of changes in fuel prices on revenue and revenue per load on loads hauled via truck is likely to be greater than that indicated. Transportation revenue generated by rail intermodal, air cargo and ocean cargo carriers (collectively, the multimode capacity providers for the 2024 thirty-nine-week period was 267,710,000, or 7 of total revenue, a decrease of 8,601,000, or 3 , compared to the 2023 thirty-nine-week period. Revenue per load on revenue generated by multimode capacity providers decreased approximately 3 in the 2024 thirty-nine-week period compared to the 2023 thirty-nine-week period, while the number of loads hauled by multimode capacity providers was approximately equal to the 2023 thirty-nine-week period. Revenue per load on loads hauled via air and rail intermodal decreased 58 and 8 respectively, while revenue per load on loads hauled via ocean increased 11 , during the 2024 thirty-nine-week period as compared to the 2023 thirty-nine-week period. The decrease in revenue per load on loads hauled by air cargo carriers was primarily attributable to the impact of high value air loadings at one specific customer during the 2023 thirty-nine-week period. The decrease in revenue per load on loads hauled by rail intermodal and the increase in revenue per load on loads hauled via ocean were both broad-based across many customers. Revenue per load on revenue generated by multimode capacity providers is influenced by many factors, including revenue mix among the various modes of transportation used, length of haul, complexity of freight, density of freight lanes, fuel costs and availability of capacity. Purchased transportation was 77.5 and 76.6 of revenue in the 2024 and 2023 thirty-nine-week periods, respectively. The increase in purchased transportation as a percentage of revenue was primarily due to an increased rate of purchased transportation on revenue generated by Truck Brokerage Carriers, partially offset by an increased percentage of revenue generated by BCO Independent Contractors, which typically has a lower rate of purchased transportation than Truck Brokerage Carriers. Commissions to agents were 8.2 and 8.9 of revenue in the 2024 and 2023 thirty-nine-week periods, respectively. The decrease in commissions to agents as a percentage of revenue was primarily attributable to an increased cost of purchased transportation as a percentage of revenue on revenue generated by Truck Brokerage Carriers. Investment income was 10,988,000 and 6,874,000 in the 2024 and 2023 thirty-nine-week periods, respectively. The increase in investment income was attributable to higher average rates of return on investments in the 2024 thirty-nine-week period and a higher average investment balance held by the insurance segment during the 2024 thirty-nine-week period. Other operating costs increased 3,140,000 in the 2024 thirty-nine-week period compared to the 2023 thirty-nine-week period. The increase in other operating costs compared to the prior year was primarily due to decreased gains on sales of operating property and an increased provision for contractor bad debt. Insurance and claims costs decreased 3,141,000 in the 2024 thirty-nine-week period compared to the 2023 thirty-nine-week period. The decrease in insurance and claims expense compared to the prior year was primarily due to decreased BCO miles traveled and decreased frequency of trucking accidents during the 2024 thirty-nine-week period, partially offset by increased net unfavorable development of prior years claims in the 2024 thirty-nine-week period. During the 2024 and 2023 thirty-nine-week periods, insurance and claims costs included 6,666,000 and 5,154,000 of net unfavorable adjustments to prior years claims estimates, respectively. 
 29 

Selling, general and administrative costs increased 3,542,000 in the 2024 thirty-nine-week period compared to the 2023 thirty-nine-week period. The increase in selling, general and administrative costs compared to prior year was primarily attributable to increased employee benefit costs, primarily attributable to increased medical and pharmacy costs under the self-insured portion of the Company s medical plan, the impact of Chief Executive Officer CEO transition costs and an increased provision for incentive compensation, partially offset by decreased project consulting fees. Included in selling, general and administrative costs was incentive compensation expense of 2,184,000 and 483,000 for the 2024 and 2023 thirty-nine-week periods, respectively. Depreciation and amortization decreased 497,000 in the 2024 thirty-nine-week period compared to the 2023 thirty-nine-week period. The decrease in depreciation and amortization expense was primarily due to decreased trailing equipment depreciation, partially offset by increased depreciation on new and updated digital tools deployed for use by the Company s network of agents, capacity providers and employees. Net interest and debt income increased 2,376,000 in the 2024 thirty-nine-week period compared to the 2023 thirty-nine-week period. The increase in interest and debt income was primarily attributable to increased interest income earned on cash balances held by the transportation logistics segment and decreased interest expense related to finance lease obligations. The provisions for income taxes for the 2024 and 2023 thirty-nine-week periods were based on estimated annual effective income tax rates of 24.3 and 24.4 , respectively, adjusted for discrete events, such as benefits resulting from stock-based awards. The effective income tax rate for the 2024 thirty-nine-week period was 23.4 . The effective income tax rate was higher than the statutory federal income tax rate of 21 in the 2024 period primarily attributable to state taxes, partially offset by federal tax credits. The effective income tax rate for the 2023 thirty-nine-week period was 24.0 . The effective income tax rate was higher than the statutory federal income tax rate of 21 in the 2023 period primarily attributable to state taxes. Net income was 149,753,000, or 4.21 per basic and diluted share, in the 2024 thirty-nine-week period. Net income was 206,407,000, or 5.74 per basic and diluted share, in the 2023 thirty-nine-week period. THIRTEEN WEEKS ENDED SEPTEMBER 28, 2024 COMPARED TO THIRTEEN WEEKS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2023 Revenue for the 2024 thirteen-week period was 1,213,867,000, a decrease of 75,478,000, or 6 , compared to the 2023 thirteen-week period. Transportation revenue decreased 73,051,000, or 6 . The decrease in transportation revenue was attributable to a decreased number of loads hauled of approximately 7 , partially offset by an increased revenue per load of approximately 2 compared to the 2023 thirteen-week period. Reinsurance premiums were 15,533,000 and 17,960,000 for the 2024 and 2023 thirteen-week periods, respectively. The decrease in revenue from reinsurance premiums was primarily attributable to a decrease in the average number of trucks provided by BCO Independent Contractors in the 2024 thirteen-week period compared to the 2023 thirteen-week period. Truck transportation revenue generated by third party truck capacity providers for the 2024 thirteen-week period was 1,091,124,000, representing 90 of total revenue, a decrease of 82,640,000, or 7 , compared to the 2023 thirteen-week period. The number of loads hauled by third party truck capacity providers decreased approximately 8 compared to the 2023 thirteen-week period, while revenue per load on loads hauled by third party truck capacity providers increased approximately 1 in the 2024 thirteen-week period compared to the 2023 thirteen-week period. The decrease in the number of loads hauled via truck compared to the 2023 thirteen-week period was primarily due to a broad-based decrease in demand for the Company s truck transportation services. Less-than-truckload loadings decreased 12 , loads hauled via other truck transportation services decreased 8 , loads hauled via van equipment decreased 8 and loads hauled via unsided/platform equipment decreased 6 as compared to the 2023 thirteen-week period. The increase in revenue per load on loads hauled via truck was primarily due to an increased average length of haul on truckload shipments during the 2024 thirteen-week period. Revenue per load on loads hauled via unsided/platform equipment increased 4 , while revenue per load on less-than-truckload loadings decreased 2 , on loads hauled via van equipment decreased 2 and on loads hauled via other truck transportation services decreased 1 as compared to the 2023 thirteen-week period.

Fuel surcharges billed to customers on revenue generated by BCO Independent Contractors are excluded from revenue. Fuel surcharges on Truck Brokerage Carrier revenue identified separately in billings to customers and included as a component of Truck Brokerage Carrier revenue were 29,560,000 and 33,584,000 in the 2024 and 2023 thirteen-week periods, respectively. Transportation revenue generated by multimode capacity providers for the 2024 thirteen-week period was 97,328,000, or 8 of total revenue, an increase of 8,440,000, or 9 , compared to the 2023 thirteen-week period. Revenue per load on revenue generated by multimode capacity providers increased approximately 6 in the 2024 thirteen-week period compared to the 2023 thirteen-week period, and the number of loads hauled by multimode capacity providers increased approximately 3 over the same period. Revenue per load on loads hauled via ocean increased 28 , while revenue per load on loads hauled via air and rail intermodal decreased 52 and 13 , respectively, during the 2024 thirteen-week period as compared to the 2023 thirteen-week period. The increase in revenue per load on loads hauled via ocean was broad-based across many customers and reflected the impact of various geopolitical events on ocean shipping rates, generally. The decrease in revenue per load on loads hauled by air cargo carriers was primarily attributable to the impact of high value air loadings at one specific customer during the 2023 thirteen-week period. The decrease in revenue per load on loads hauled by rail intermodal was broad-based. Revenue per load on revenue generated by multimode capacity providers is influenced by many factors, including revenue mix among the various modes of transportation used, length of haul, complexity of freight, density of freight lanes, fuel costs and availability of capacity. The increase in the number of loads hauled by multimode capacity providers was due to increases in air, rail intermodal and ocean loadings of 10 , 4 and 1 , respectively. The 10 increase in air loadings was primarily attributable to increased loadings at one specific agency. The 4 increase in rail intermodal loadings was primarily attributable to increased loadings at three specific agencies. The 1 increase in ocean loadings was primarily attributable to increased loadings at one specific customer. Purchased transportation was 77.8 and 76.5 of revenue in the 2024 and 2023 thirteen-week periods, respectively. The increase in purchased transportation as a percentage of revenue was primarily due to (i) an increased rate of purchased transportation on revenue generated by Truck Brokerage Carriers and (ii) an increased percentage of revenue generated by Truck Brokerage Carriers and multimode capacity providers, which typically have a higher rate of purchased transportation than that of BCO Independent Contractors. Commissions to agents were 8.1 and 8.9 of revenue in the 2024 and 2023 thirteen-week periods, respectively. The decrease in commissions to agents as a percentage of revenue was primarily attributable to an increased cost of purchased transportation as a percentage of revenue on revenue generated by Truck Brokerage Carriers. Investment income was 3,922,000 and 3,022,000 in the 2024 and 2023 thirteen-week periods, respectively. The increase in investment income was attributable to higher average rates of return on investments in the 2024 thirteen-week period and a higher average investment balance held by the insurance segment during the 2024 thirteen-week period. Other operating costs decreased 14,000 in the 2024 thirteen-week period compared to the 2023 thirteen-week period. The decrease in other operating costs compared to the prior year was primarily due to decreased trailing equipment maintenance costs, almost entirely offset by an increased provision for contractor bad debt and decreased gains on sales of operating property. Insurance and claims costs increased 858,000 in the 2024 thirteen-week period compared to the 2023 thirteen-week period. The increase in insurance and claims expense compared to the prior year was primarily due to increased net unfavorable development of prior years claims in the 2024 thirteen-week period, partially offset by decreased BCO miles traveled and decreased frequency of current year trucking claims during the 2024 thirteen-week period. During the 2024 and 2023 thirteen-week periods, insurance and claims costs included 4,550,000 and 2,323,000 of net unfavorable adjustments to prior years claims estimates, respectively. Selling, general and administrative costs increased 277,000 in the 2024 thirteen-week period compared to the 2023 thirteen-week period. The increase in selling, general and administrative costs compared to prior year was primarily attributable to increased employee benefit costs, primarily attributable to increased medical and pharmacy costs under the self-insured portion of the Company s medical plan, and an increased provision for incentive compensation, partially offset by decreased stock-based compensation expense and decreased project consulting fees. Included in selling, general and administrative costs was incentive compensation expense of 729,000 and 160,000 for the 2024 and 2023 thirteen-week periods, respectively, and stock-based compensation (benefit) expense of 43,000) and 1,144,000 for the 2024 and 2023 thirteen-week periods, respectively. Depreciation and amortization increased 1,012,000 in the 2024 thirteen-week period compared to the 2023 thirteen-week period. The increase in depreciation and amortization expense was primarily due to increased depreciation on new and updated digital tools deployed for use by the Company s network of agents, capacity providers and employees, partially offset by decreased trailing equipment depreciation. 
 31 

Net interest and debt income increased 123,000 in the 2024 thirteen-week period compared to the 2023 thirteen-week period. The increase in interest and debt income was primarily attributable to increased interest income earned on cash balances held by the transportation logistics segment, partially offset by increased interest expense related to finance lease obligations. The provisions for income taxes for the 2024 and 2023 thirteen-week periods were based on estimated annual effective income tax rates of 24.3 and 24.4 , respectively, adjusted for discrete events, such as benefits resulting from stock-based awards. The effective income tax rate for the 2024 thirteen-week period was 22.2 . The effective income tax rate was higher than the statutory federal income tax rate of 21 in the 2024 period primarily attributable to state taxes, partially offset by federal tax credits. The effective income tax rate for the 2023 thirteen-week period was 24.3 . The effective income tax rate was higher than the statutory federal income tax rate of 21 in the 2023 period primarily attributable to state taxes. Net income was 50,033,000, or 1.41 per basic and diluted share, in the 2024 thirteen-week period. Net income was 61,653,000, or 1.71 per basic and diluted share, in the 2023 thirteen-week period. CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY Working capital and the ratio of current assets to current liabilities were 718,742,000 and 2.2 to 1, respectively, at September 28, 2024, compared with 677,517,000 and 2.0 to 1, respectively, at December 30, 2023. Landstar has historically operated with current ratios within the range of 1.5 to 1 to 2.0 to 1. Cash provided by operating activities was 225,439,000 in the 2024 thirty-nine-week period compared with 303,785,000 in the 2023 thirty-nine-week period. The decrease in cash flow provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to decreased net income and decreased favorable net working capital impacts in connection with decreased net receivables, defined as accounts receivable less accounts payable. The Company declared and paid 1.02 per share, or 36,325,000 in the aggregate, in cash dividends during the thirty-nine-week period ended September 28, 2024 and, during such period, also paid 71,433,000 of dividends payable which were declared in December 2023 and included in current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet at December 30, 2023. The Company declared and paid 0.93 per share, or 33,448,000 in the aggregate, in cash dividends during the thirty-nine-week period ended September 30, 2023 and, during such period, also paid 71,854,000 of dividends payable which were declared in December 2022 and included in current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2022. During the thirty-nine-week period ended September 28, 2024, the Company purchased 436,919 shares of its common stock at a total cost of 79,388,000, including 78,697,000 in cash purchases and accrued excise tax of 691,000, which is included in other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet at September 28, 2024. During the thirty-nine-week period ended September 30, 2023, the Company purchased 89,661 shares of its common stock at a total cost of 15,433,000. As of September 28, 2024, the Company may purchase in the aggregate up to 2,563,081 shares of its common stock under its authorized stock purchase programs. Long-term debt, including current maturities, was 72,506,000 at September 28, 2024, 1,366,000 higher than at December 30, 2023. Shareholders equity was 1,015,918,000, or 93 of total capitalization (defined as long-term debt including current maturities plus equity), at September 28, 2024, compared to 983,923,000, or 93 of total capitalization, at December 30, 2023. The increase in shareholders equity was primarily the result of net income, partially offset by purchases of shares of the Company s common stock and dividends declared by the Company in the 2024 thirty-nine-week period. On July 1, 2022, Landstar entered into a second amended and restated credit agreement with a bank syndicate led by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent (as further amended as of June 21, 2024, the Credit Agreement ). The Credit Agreement, which matures July 1, 2027, provides for borrowing capacity in the form of a revolving credit facility of 300,000,000, 45,000,000 of which may be utilized in the form of letters of credit. The Credit Agreement also includes an accordion feature providing for a possible increase of up to an aggregate amount of borrowing capacity of 600,000,000. The Credit Agreement contains a number of covenants that limit, among other things, the incurrence of additional indebtedness. The Company is required to, among other things, maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio, as described in the Credit Agreement, and maintain a Leverage Ratio, as defined in the Credit Agreement, below a specified maximum. The Credit Agreement provides for a restriction on cash dividends and other distributions to stockholders on the Company s capital stock to the extent there is a default under the Credit Agreement. In addition, the Credit Agreement under certain circumstances limits the amount of such cash dividends and other distributions to stockholders to the extent that, after giving effect to any payment made to effect such cash dividend or other distribution, the Leverage Ratio would exceed 2.5 to 1 on a pro forma basis as of the end of the Company s most recently completed fiscal quarter. The Credit Agreement provides for an event of default in the event that, among other things, a person or group acquires 35 or more of the outstanding capital stock of the Company or obtains power to elect a majority of the Company s directors or the directors cease to consist of a majority of Continuing Directors, as defined in the Credit Agreement. None of these covenants are presently considered by the Company to be materially restrictive to the Company s operations, capital resources or liquidity. The Company is currently in compliance with all of the debt covenants under the Credit Agreement. 
 32 

At September 28, 2024, the Company had no borrowings outstanding and 35,250,000 of letters of credit outstanding under the Credit Agreement. At September 28, 2024, there was 264,750,000 available for future borrowings under the Credit Agreement and access to an additional 300,000,000 under the Credit Agreement s accordion feature. In addition, the Company has 73,117,000 in letters of credit outstanding as collateral for insurance claims that are secured by investments totaling 81,241,000 at September 28, 2024. Investments, all of which are carried at fair value, include primarily investment-grade bonds, asset-backed securities and commercial paper having maturities of up to five years. Fair value of investments is based primarily on quoted market prices. See Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included herein for further discussion on measurement of fair value of investments. Historically, the Company has generated sufficient operating cash flow to meet its debt service requirements, fund continued growth, both organic and through acquisitions, complete or execute share purchases of its common stock under authorized share purchase programs, pay dividends and meet working capital needs. As an asset-light provider of integrated transportation management solutions, the Company s annual capital requirements for operating property are generally for trailing equipment and information technology hardware and software. In addition, a significant portion of the trailing equipment available to the Company is provided by third party capacity providers, thereby reducing the Company s capital requirements. During the 2024 thirty-nine-week period, the Company purchased 24,256,000 of operating property and acquired 24,238,000 of trailing equipment by entering into finance leases. In addition, during the 2024 thirty-nine-week period, Landstar acquired 6,690,000 of operating property for which the Company accrued a corresponding liability of 1,201,000 in accounts payable and 5,489,000 in other noncurrent liabilities as of September 28, 2024. Landstar anticipates acquiring either by purchase or lease financing during the remainder of fiscal year 2024 approximately 39,000,000 in operating property, consisting primarily of new trailing equipment to replace older trailing equipment and information technology hardware and software. Management believes that cash flow from operations combined with the Company s borrowing capacity under the Credit Agreement will be adequate to meet Landstar s debt service requirements, fund continued growth, both internal and through acquisitions, pay dividends, complete the authorized share purchase programs and meet working capital needs. LEGAL MATTERS The Company is involved in certain claims and pending litigation arising from the normal conduct of business. Many of these claims are covered in whole or in part by insurance. Based on knowledge of the facts and, in certain cases, opinions of outside counsel, the Company believes that adequate provisions have been made for probable and reasonably estimable losses with respect to the resolution of all such claims and pending litigation and that the ultimate outcome, after provisions therefor, will not have a material adverse effect on the financial condition of the Company, but could have a material effect on the results of operations in a given quarter or year. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES Landstar provides for the estimated costs of self-insured claims primarily on an actuarial basis. The amount recorded for the estimated liability for claims incurred is based upon the facts and circumstances known on the applicable balance sheet date. The ultimate resolution of these claims may be for an amount greater or less than the amount estimated by the Company. The Company continually revises its existing claim estimates as new or revised information becomes available on the status of each claim. Historically, the Company has experienced both favorable and unfavorable development of prior years claims estimates within its various programs. During the 2024 and 2023 thirty-nine-week periods, insurance and claims costs included 6,666,000 and 5,154,000 of net unfavorable adjustments to prior years claims estimates, respectively. It is reasonably likely that the ultimate outcome of settling all outstanding claims will be more or less than the estimated claims liability at September 28, 2024, primarily due to the inherent difficulty in estimating the severity of commercial trucking claims and the potential judgment or settlement amount that may be incurred in connection with the resolution of such claims. Significant variances from the Company s estimates for the ultimate resolution of self-insured claims could be expected to positively or negatively affect Landstar s earnings in a given quarter or year. However, management believes that the ultimate resolution of these items, given a range of reasonably likely outcomes, will not significantly affect the long-term financial condition of Landstar or its ability to fund its continuing operations. 
 33 

SEASONALITY Landstar s operations are subject to seasonal trends common to the trucking industry. Historically, truckload shipments for the quarter ending in March are typically lower than for the quarters ending June, September and December. The COVID-19 global pandemic and related supply chain issues significantly disrupted these typical seasonal patterns. In particular, the Company s 2022 and 2023 fiscal year results did not reflect normal seasonal patterns. No assurances can be given regarding the extent to which or when trends common to the trucking industry and Landstar s operations, in particular, will return to more typical, pre-pandemic, seasonal patterns. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The Company is exposed to changes in interest rates as a result of its financing activities, primarily its borrowings on its revolving credit facility, if any, and investing activities with respect to investments held by the insurance segment. On July 1, 2022, Landstar entered into the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (as further amended as of June 21, 2024, the Credit Agreement with a bank syndicate led by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent. The Credit Agreement, which matures July 1, 2027, provides for borrowing capacity in the form of a revolving credit facility of 300,000,000, 45,000,000 of which may be utilized in the form of letters of credit. The Credit Agreement also includes an accordion feature providing for a possible increase of up to an aggregate amount of borrowing capacity of 600,000,000. The revolving credit loans under the Credit Agreement as of September 28, 2024, at the option of Landstar, bear interest at (i) a forward-looking term rate based on the secured overnight financing rate plus 0.10 and an applicable margin ranging from 1.25 to 2.00 , or (ii) an alternate base rate plus an applicable margin ranging from 0.25 to 1.00 , in each case with the applicable margin determined based upon the Company s Leverage Ratio, as defined in the Credit Agreement, at the end of the most recent applicable fiscal quarter for which financial statements have been delivered. The revolving credit facility bears a commitment fee, payable in arrears, of 0.20 to 0.30 , based on the Company s Leverage Ratio at the end of the most recent applicable fiscal quarter for which financial statements have been delivered. During the third quarter of 2024 and as of September 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023, the Company had no borrowings outstanding under the Credit Agreement. Long-term investments, all of which are available-for-sale and are carried at fair value, include primarily investment-grade bonds and asset-backed securities having maturities of up to five years. Assuming that the long-term portion of investments remains at 86,408,000, the balance at September 28, 2024, a hypothetical increase or decrease in interest rates of 100 basis points would not have a material impact on future earnings on an annualized basis. Short-term investments primarily consist of short-term investment-grade instruments and the current maturities of investment-grade corporate bonds and asset-backed securities. Accordingly, any future interest rate risk on these short-term investments would not be material to the Company s operating results. Assets and liabilities of the Company s Canadian and Mexican operations are translated from their functional currency to U.S. dollars using exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date and revenue and expense accounts are translated at average monthly exchange rates during the period. Adjustments resulting from the translation process are included in accumulated other comprehensive income. Transactional gains and losses arising from receivable and payable balances, including intercompany balances, in the normal course of business that are denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the operation are recorded in the statements of income when they occur. The assets held at the Company s Canadian and Mexican subsidiaries at September 28, 2024 were collectively, as translated to U.S. dollars, less than 3 of total consolidated assets. Accordingly, translation gains or losses of approximately 30 or less related to the Canadian and Mexican operations would not be material. Item 4. Controls and Procedures As of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report on Form 10-Q, an evaluation was carried out, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s management, including the CEO and the Chief Financial Officer CFO ), of the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended). Based on that evaluation, the CEO and CFO concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 28, 2024 to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms. 
 34 

There were no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting during the third quarter of 2024, which were identified in connection with management s evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting. In designing and evaluating disclosure controls and procedures, Company management recognizes that any disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Because of the inherent limitation in any control system, no evaluation or implementation of a control system can provide complete assurance that all control issues and all possible instances of fraud have been or will be detected.
