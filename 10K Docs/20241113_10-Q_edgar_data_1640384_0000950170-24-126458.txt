LM FUNDING AMERICA, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 202 4 
 (UNAUDITED) 

owned subsidiaries to engage in business in various states in connection with its Bitcoin mining business. LMFAO Sponsor LLC formed a majority owned subsidiary, LMF Acquisition Opportunities Inc. LMAO on October 29, 2020, which was organized as a special purpose acquisition company that completed an initial public offering in January 2021, whereupon the Company ceased to be majority owned by LMFA. LMF Acquisition Opportunities Inc. was subsequently merged with Seastar Medical Holding Corporation on October 28, 2022. The Company also from time to time organizes other subsidiaries to serve a specific purpose or hold a specific asset. Lines of Business The Company currently operates two lines of business: our cryptocurrency mining business and our specialty finance business. The Bitcoin mining operation deploys our computing power to mine Bitcoin on the Bitcoin network. We conduct this business through our wholly owned subsidiary, US Digital, a Florida limited liability company, which we formed in 2021 to develop and operate our cryptocurrency mining business. With respect to our specialty finance business, the Company has historically engaged in the business of providing funding to nonprofit community associations primarily located in the state of Florida. We offer incorporated nonprofit community associations, which we refer to as Associations, a variety of financial products customized to each Association s financial needs. Bitcoin Mining Business We obtain Bitcoin as a result of our mining operations, and we sell Bitcoin from time to time, to support our operations and strategic growth. We plan to convert our Bitcoin to U.S. dollars. We may engage in regular trading of Bitcoin or engage in hedging activities related to our holding of Bitcoin. However, our decisions to hold or sell Bitcoin at any given time may be impacted by the Bitcoin market, which has been historically characterized by significant volatility. Currently, we do not use a formula or specific methodology to determine whether or when we will sell Bitcoin that we hold, or the number of Bitcoins we will sell. Rather, decisions to hold or sell Bitcoins are currently determined by management based on working cash needs and by monitoring the market in real time. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , the Company had approximately machines, which amounted to operating units capable of producing over petahash and petahash, respectively, per second EH/s of computing power. Specialty Finance Company In our specialty finance business, we purchase an Association s right to receive a portion of the Association s collected proceeds from owners that are not paying their assessments. After taking assignment of an Association s right to receive a portion of the Association s proceeds from the collection of delinquent assessments, we engage law firms to perform collection work on a deferred billing basis wherein the law firms receive payment upon collection from the account debtors or a predetermined contracted amount if payment from account debtors is less than legal fees and costs owed. 
 owned subsidiary limited liability companies); LM Funding of Colorado, LLC; LM Funding of Washington, LLC; LM Funding of Illinois, LLC; US Digital (includes all owned subsidiary limited liability companies) and LMF SPE #2, LLC and various single purpose limited liability corporations owned by REO Management Holdings, LLC which own various properties. It also includes LMFA Sponsor, LLC (a owned subsidiary). All significant intercompany balances have been eliminated in consolidation.

thousand cumulative-effect change to adjust the Company's Bitcoin held on January 1, 2024 with the corresponding entry to beginning accumulated deficit. 
 operating segments as of September 30, 2024, which we refer to as Specialty Finance and Mining Operations. Our corporate oversight function and other components that may earn revenues that are only incidental to the activities of the Company are aggregated and included in the All Other category. Refer to Note 9 - Segment Information. 
 
 million available cash on-hand and Bitcoin with a fair market value of million (of which million is pledged as collateral against outstanding borrowings and classified within "Digital assets - long-term" on the consolidated balance sheets). After considering its current liquidity and future market and economic conditions, the Company has concluded there is no substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern.

owned and more than owned entities using the equity method of accounting. Because we have elected the fair value option for these securities, unrealized holding gains and losses during the period are included in other income within the Consolidated Statements of Operation. 
 
 . Fixed assets are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation. State and local use tax for equipment shipped from overseas is generally accrued on a quarterly basis at the time equipment is placed in service and is paid to the state in which the equipment is being utilized. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets and commences once the assets are ready for their intended use. Fixed assets are comprised of furniture, computer, office equipment, buildings and mining machines with assigned useful lives of to years. The Company classifies mining machine deposit payments within "Deposits on mining equipment" in the consolidated balance sheets. As mining machines are received, the respective cost of the mining machines plus the related shipping and customs fees are reclassified from "Deposits on mining equipment" to "Fixed assets, net" in the consolidated balance sheets. Refer to Note 4 - Deposits on Mining Equipment and Hosting Services. In addition, as part of its periodic review of its fixed asset groups during the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company changed the estimated useful life for its mining machines from to . The change was accounted for on a prospective basis. The Company operates in an emerging industry for which limited data is available to make estimates of the useful economic lives of mining machines. To the extent that any of the assumptions underlying management s estimate of useful life of its mining machines are subject to revision in a future reporting period, either as a result of changes in circumstances or through the availability of greater quantities of data, then the estimated useful life could change and have a prospective impact on depreciation expense and the carrying amounts of these assets. 
 million which were delivered in two shipments during March 2024 and April 2024. 
 thousand and thousand. 
 and million impairment loss recorded on fixed assets during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and impairment loss recorded on fixed assets during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. Refer to Note 3 - Fixed Assets. 
 of the

calendar days before such renewal of its desire for the order not to renew unless terminated sooner pursuant to the terms of the Core Hosting Agreement. The Company entered into a number of amendments in 2023 and 2024 that resulted in Core hosting a total of approximately miners. The amended Hosting Agreement results in the terms of the hosting arrangement expiring with respect to approximately miners on May 31, 2024 while allowing the terms of the hosting arrangement to continue with respect to approximately miners through December 31, 2024. As required under the Core Hosting Agreement, the Company paid a million deposit as of December 31, 2023. Under the terms of the amended Hosting Agreement, the deposit related to the miners that were removed was applied to our invoices. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had nil and million of the prepaid deposit remaining with Core, respectively. In December 2022, Core filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas. Core's bankruptcy filing has not negatively impacted our mining ability at their sites as of the date of this filing. On May 5, 2023, the Company entered into a hosting agreement (the GIGA Hosting Agreement with GIGA pursuant to which GIGA agreed to host of the Company's Bitcoin Miner S19J Pro machines at a secure location and provide power, maintenance and other services specified in the contract with a term of one year. On April 12, 2024, the Company amended the contract to allow for an extension of the contract with a day termination notice. As required under the GIGA Hosting Agreemen t, the Company paid thousand as a pre-payment in May 20 23 and paid a refundable deposit of thousand in August 2023. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, t he Company had nil and thousand of prepaid deposits remaining with GIGA, respectively. All of the machines hosted by Giga were moved to a third-party warehouse in July 2024 and are awaiting a new hosting site. On May 6, 2024, the Company entered into a hosting agreement (the Arthur Hosting Agreement with Tech Infrastructure pursuant to which Tech Infrastructure agreed to host approximately of the Company's Bitcoin Miner S19J Pro machines at a secure location and provide power, maintenance and other services specified in the contract with a term of nine months. On July 17, 2024, the Company amended the contract to allow for an extension of the contract of one month. 
 of the total daily bitcoin mined. Applying the criteria per ASC 606-10-25-1, the contract arises at the point that the Company provides hash calculations to the Customer, which is considered at contract inception, because customer consumption is in tandem with daily earnings of delivery of the computing power. Step 2: In order to identify the performance obligations in a contract with a customer, the Company must assess the promised goods or services in the contract and identify each promised good or service that is distinct. A performance obligation meets ASC 606 s definition of a distinct good or service (or bundle of goods or services) if both of the following criteria are met: The customer can benefit from the good or service either on its own or together with other resources that are readily available to the customer (i.e., the good or service is capable of being distinct); and The entity s promise to transfer the good or service to the customer is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract (i.e., the promise to transfer the good or service is distinct within the context of the contract). Based on these criteria, the Company has a single performance obligation in providing hash calculations to the Customer. The continuous renewal options do not represent material rights because they do not provide the Customer with the right to purchase additional goods or services at a discount. Specifically, the contract is renewed at the same terms, conditions, and rate as the current contract which is consistent with market rates, and there are no upfront or incremental fees in the initial contract. The Company has full control of the mining equipment utilized in the mining pool and if the Company determines it will increase or decrease the processing power of its machines and/or fleet (i.e., for repairs or when power costs are excessive) the computing power provided to the customer will be reduced.

months. Under these arrangements, the Company considers the collection of amounts funded is not assured and under the cost recovery method, cash collected is applied to first reduce the carrying value of the funded or principal amount with any remaining proceeds applied next to interest, late fees, legal fees, collection costs and any amounts due to the Association. Any excess proceeds still remaining are recognized as revenues. If the future proceeds collected are lower than the Company s funded or principal amount, then a loss is recognized. Net Commission Revenue: The Company acts as an agent in providing health travel insurance policies. As a result, the Company revenue is recorded at net. The Company has determined that the known amount of cash to be realized or realizable on its revenue generating activities can be reasonably estimated and as such, classifies its receivables as accrual and recognizes revenues in the accompanying statements of income on the accrual basis. If a policy is not effective as of the end of a period, then the associated revenue and underwriting costs are deferred until the effective date. The majority of the commission revenue is underwritten by two policy underwriters who pays the Company commissions. 
 thousand, which was recognized as other income within "Other income - coupon sales" in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company sold Bitmain coupons for approximately thousand and thousand respectively. 
 uncertain tax positions as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Deferred income taxes are recognized in the consolidated financial statements for the tax consequences in future years of differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts based on enacted tax laws and statutory tax rates. Temporary differences arise from net operating losses, differences in depreciation methods of archived images, and property and equipment, stock-based and other compensation, and other accrued expenses. A valuation allowance is established when it is determined that it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The application of tax laws and regulations is subject to legal and factual interpretation, judgment and uncertainty. Tax laws and regulations themselves are subject to change as a result of changes in fiscal policy, changes in legislation, the evolution of regulations and court rulings. Therefore, the actual liability for U.S., or the various state jurisdictions, may be materially different from managements estimates, which could result in the need to record additional tax liabilities or potentially reverse previously recorded tax liabilities. Interest and penalties are included in tax expense.

Carrying basis of Bitcoin 

Fair value of Bitcoin 

The carrying basis represents the valuation of Bitcoin at the time the Company earns the Bitcoin through mining activities. The carrying basis for Bitcoin held prior to the adoption of ASU 2023-08 was determined on the "cost less impairment" basis. Fair value of Bitcoin was determined using Level 1 inputs. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 approximately Bitcoin (with an approximate fair value of million) and nil Bitcoin were held in a custody account as collateral for the million Liebel loan. Accordingly, the Company is restricted in its ability to use the Bitcoin separately held as collateral in the operation of its business. The Company regularly moves the collateral Bitcoin out of the collateral account when the fair value of such Bitcoin increases and deposits additional Bitcoin into the collateral account when the fair value of such Bitcoin decreases.

Legal Proceedings 	 Except as described below, we are not currently a party to material pending or known threatened litigation proceedings. However, we frequently become party to litigation in the ordinary course of business, including either the prosecution or defense of claims arising from contracts by and between us and client Associations. Regardless of the outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on us because of prosecution, defense, and settlement costs, diversion of management resources and other factors. The Company accrues for contingent obligations, including estimated legal costs, when the obligation is probable and the amount is reasonably estimable. As facts concerning contingencies become known, the Company reassesses its position and makes appropriate adjustments to the consolidated financial statements. Estimates that are particularly sensitive to future changes include those related to tax, legal, and other regulatory matters. In October 2021, we entered into a sale and purchase agreement (the Uptime Purchase Agreement with Uptime Armory LLC Uptime pursuant to which US Digital agreed to purchase, and Uptime agreed to supply to US Digital, an aggregate of modified 40-foot cargo containers POD5ive containers that will be designed to hold and operate 280 S19 Pro Antminers manufactured by Bitmain. The purchase price of the POD5ive containers totals million, of which million or was paid in 2021 as a non-refundable down payment and the remaining was paid after Uptime delivered a notice of completion of the equipment in 2022. However, no containers have been delivered as of September 30, 2024. On November 8, 2022, LMFA filed an action in Florida circuit court against Uptime Armory, LLC and Bit5ive, LLC in a case styled US Digital Mining and Hosting Co. LLC v. Uptime Amory, LLC and Bit5ive, LLC (Fla. 11thCir. Ct., November 8, 2022). In that action, we alleged breach of contract and violation of the Florida Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices Act and are seeking, among other things, damages of million for non-delivery of the POD5ive containers. The Defendants in this action filed a motion to compel confidential arbitration action. The court has now stayed the action in the Florida Circuit Court, and ordered the parties to confidential arbitration governed by the American Arbitration Association and the case is proceeding to arbitration. We recorded an impairment charge of million on our mining machine deposit in the fourth quarter of 2022 and is reported on our Consolidated Statements of Operations as Impairment loss on prepaid mining machine deposits. The arbitrator has ruled in favor of US Digital s dispositive motions against Uptime Armory and Bit5ive. Entities Uptime Armory, LLC, Uptime Hosting, LLC, and Bit5ive, LLC have filed for Assignment for the Benefit of Creditors. LMFA US Digital s Proof of Claim against entities was filed in the Circuit Court of the eleventh Judicial Circuit, in and for Miami-Dade County, Florida in the amount of Arbitrator s award of million (owed joint and several with Bit5ive, LLC). In October 2021, US Digital also entered into a hosting agreement with Uptime Hosting LLC (the Hosting Agreement to host the Company s POD5ive containers at a secure location and provide power, maintenance and other services specified in the contract for 6 cents per kilowatt with a term of one year. Under the Hosting Agreement we paid a deposit of million in 2021 and were required to pay an additional deposit for each container three and nine months prior to delivery at the hosting site of thousand and a final deposit for each container one month prior to arrival at the hosting site of thousand.

Certain outstanding and exercisable warrants include price protection provisions requiring a reduction in the instrument's exercise price in the event that the Company subsequently issues shares at a purchase price, or warrants at an exercise price, lower than the instrument's original exercise price. As a result of the Transactions, the provision was triggered and the exercise price for warrants was reduced from to . In accordance with ASC 260, when an instrument's exercise price is reduced in accordance with a price protection provision, the issuer is required to determine the value that was transferred to the holder of the warrant as calculated by comparing the hypothetical fair value of the warrant immediately before and immediately after the exercise price reduction and record the amount as a reduction to retained earnings and increase to additional paid in capital (i.e. deemed dividend).

Overview 
 The Company currently operates two lines of business: our cryptocurrency mining business and our specialty finance business. 
 The Bitcoin mining operation deploys our computing power to mine Bitcoin on the Bitcoin network. We conduct this business through our wholly owned subsidiary, US Digital, a Florida limited liability company, which we formed in 2021 to develop and operate our cryptocurrency mining business. 
 With respect to our specialty finance business, the Company has historically engaged in the business of providing funding to nonprofit community associations primarily located in the state of Florida. We offer incorporated nonprofit community associations, which we refer to as Associations, a variety of financial products customized to each Association s financial needs. Our original product offering consists of providing funding to Associations by purchasing their rights under delinquent accounts that are selected by the Associations arising from unpaid Association assessments. Historically, we provided funding against such delinquent accounts, which we refer to as Accounts, in exchange for a portion of the proceeds collected by the Associations from the account debtors on the Accounts. In addition to our original product offering, we also purchase Accounts on varying terms tailored to suit each Association s financial needs, including under our New Neighbor Guaranty program. 
 Corporate History 
 The Company was originally organized in January 2008 as a Florida limited liability company under the name LM Funding, LLC. Prior to our initial public offering in 2015, all of our business was conducted through LM Funding, LLC and its subsidiaries. Immediately prior to our initial public offering in October 2015, the members of the LM Funding, LLC contributed all of their membership interests to LM Funding America, Inc., a Delaware corporation incorporated on April 20, 2015 LMFA ), in exchange for shares of the common stock of LMFA. Immediately after such contribution and exchange, the former members of LM Funding, LLC became the holders of 100 of the issued and outstanding common stock of LMFA, thereby making LM Funding, LLC a wholly-owned subsidiary of LMFA. 
 The Company organized two new subsidiaries in 2020: LMFA Financing LLC, a Florida limited liability company, on November 21, 2020, and LMFAO Sponsor LLC, a Florida limited liability company, on October 29, 2020. LMFAO Sponsor LLC organized a subsidiary, LMF Acquisition Opportunities Inc., on October 29, 2020. LM Funding America Inc. organized a subsidiary, US Digital (and 100 subsidiaries), on September 10, 2021. US Digital has formed 100 owned subsidiaries to engage in business in various states in connection with its Bitcoin mining business. The Company also from time to time organizes other subsidiaries to serve a specific purpose or hold a specific asset. LMF Acquisition Opportunities Inc. was merged with Seastar Medical Holding Corporation on October 28, 2022. 
 Cryptocurrency Mining Business 
 Bitcoin was introduced in 2008 with the goal of serving as a digital means of exchanging and storing value. Bitcoin is a form of digital currency that depends upon a consensus-based network and a public ledger called a blockchain , which contains a record of every Bitcoin transaction ever processed. The Bitcoin network is the first decentralized peer-to-peer payment network, powered by users participating in the consensus protocol, with no central authority or middlemen, that has wide network participation. The authenticity of each Bitcoin transaction is protected through digital signatures that correspond with addresses of users that send and receive Bitcoin. Users have full control over remitting Bitcoin from their own sending addresses. All transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain are transparent, allowing those running the appropriate software to confirm the validity of each transaction. To be recorded on the blockchain, each Bitcoin transaction is validated through a proof-of-work consensus method, which entails solving complex mathematical problems to validate transactions and post them on the blockchain. This process is called mining. Miners are rewarded with Bitcoins, both in the form of newly-created Bitcoins and transaction fees in Bitcoin, for successfully solving the mathematical problems and providing computing power to the network. 
 We obtain Bitcoin as a result of our mining operations, and we sell Bitcoin from time to time, to support our operations and strategic growth. We plan to convert our Bitcoin to U.S. dollars. We may engage in regular trading of Bitcoin or engage in hedging activities related to our holding of Bitcoin. However, our decisions to hold or sell Bitcoin at any given time may be impacted by the Bitcoin market, which has been historically characterized by significant volatility. Currently, we do not use a formula or specific methodology to determine whether or when we will sell Bitcoin that we hold, or the number of Bitcoins we will sell. Rather, decisions to hold or sell Bitcoins are currently determined by management by monitoring the market in real time. 
 Factors such as access to computer processing capacity, interconnectivity, electricity cost, environmental factors (such as cooling capacity) and location play important roles in mining. In Bitcoin mining, hashrate is a measure of the computing and processing power and speed by which a mining computer mines and processes transactions on the Bitcoin network. A company s computing power measured in hashrate is generally considered to be one of the most important metrics for evaluating Bitcoin mining companies. 
 As of each of September 30, 2024 and 2023 , the Company owned approximately 5,900 machines, which translated into our operating mining units being capable of producing over 639 petahash and 615 petahash per second EH/s of computing power as of September 30, 2024 and 2023. There were approximately 3,700 and 5,900 miners online as of September 30, 2024 and 2023, 
 31 

respectively. We have an additional 2,200 miners in a third-party warehouse for redeployment. We expect to continue increasing our computing power through 2025 and beyond as we expand the number of active mining machines. 
 The Company currently uses three companies to host its miners: Core Scientific Inc. ("Core"), Giga Energy Inc ("GIGA") and Tech Infrastructure JV I LLC ("Tech Infrastructure"). 
 On September 5, 2022, the Company, through its wholly-owned subsidiary US Digital, entered into a hosting agreement (the Core Hosting Agreement with Core pursuant to which Core, under various additional orders, agreed to host approximately 3,000 of the Company's Bitcoin miner machines at a secure location and provide power, maintenance and other services specified in the contract with a term of one year, with automatic renewals unless either party notifies the other party in writing not less than ninety (90) calendar days before such renewal of its desire for the order not to renew unless terminated sooner pursuant to the terms of the Core Hosting Agreement. The Company entered into a number of amendments in 2023 and 2024 that resulted in Core hosting a total of approximately 4,870 miners. The amended Hosting Agreement results in the terms of the hosting arrangement expiring with respect to approximately 4,000 miners on May 31, 2024 while allowing the terms of the hosting arrangement to continue with respect to approximately 800 miners through December 31, 2024. 
 As required under the Core Hosting Agreement, the Company paid a 2.2 million deposit as of December 31, 2023. Under the terms of the amended Hosting Agreement, the deposit related to the 4,000 miners that were removed was applied to our invoices. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had nil and 2.1 million of the prepaid deposit remaining with Core, respectively. In December 2022, Core filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas. Core's bankruptcy filing has not negatively impacted our mining ability at their sites as of the date of this filing. 
 On May 5, 2023, the Company entered into a hosting agreement (the GIGA Hosting Agreement with GIGA pursuant to which GIGA agreed to host 1,080 of the Company's Bitcoin Miner S19J Pro machines at a secure location and provide power, maintenance and other services specified in the contract with a term of one year. On April 12, 2024, the Company amended the contract to allow for an extension of the contract with a 60 day termination notice. As required under the GIGA Hosting Agreement, the Company paid 173 thousand as a pre-payment in May 2023 and paid a refundable deposit of 173 thousand in August 2023. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, the Company had nil and 117 thousand of prepaid deposits remaining with GIGA, respectively. All of the machines hosted by Giga were moved to a third-party warehouse in July 2024 and are awaiting a new hosting site. 
 On May 6, 2024, the Company entered into a hosting agreement (the Arthur Hosting Agreement with Tech Infrastructure pursuant to which Tech Infrastructure agreed to host approximately 3,000 of the Company's Bitcoin Miner S19J Pro machines at a secure location and provide power, maintenance and other services specified in the contract with a term of nine months. On July 17, 2024, the Company amended the contract to allow for an extension of the contract of one month. This contract s energy rate is approximately 0.04 per Kilowatt.

Effective January 1, 2024, we adopted ASC 350-60 which required Bitcoin to be measured at fair value. See Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies for more details on impact of implementation to the financial statements. As a result, the carrying value of each Bitcoin we held at the end of September 30, 2024 and each subsequent reporting period reflects the price of one Bitcoin quoted on the active exchange at the end of the reporting period. Therefore, negative swings in the market price of Bitcoin could have a material impact on our earnings and on the carrying value of our Bitcoin.

The Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 compared with the Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 Revenues 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, total revenues decreased by 2.2 million, to 1.3 million from 3.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Digital mining revenue decreased in the three months ended September 30, 2024 by 2.2 million to 1.1 million from 3.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Bitcoin mining revenues are determined by two main drivers: quantity of Bitcoin mined and the price of Bitcoin on the date the Bitcoin is mined. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we mined 18.4 Bitcoin with an average Bitcoin price of approximately 61 thousand as compared to 117.1 Bitcoin with an average Bitcoin price of approximately 28 thousand during the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in Bitcoin mining revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was attributable to the reduction in the number of Bitcoins mined during the period due to the temporary idling of mining machines that were in transit as well as the increased difficulty rate, which reduced our share of the global hashrate, offset in part by the increase in Bitcoin prices. 
 Operating Expenses 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, operating expenses decreased 0.9 million to 5.7 million from 6.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in operating expenses is primarily due to the following factors: 
 Digital mining cost of revenues 
 Bitcoin mining costs decreased by 2.0 million to 0.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 2.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 due to the temporary idling of mining machines that were in transit and lower hosting costs per machine. 
 Staff costs and payroll 
 Compensation costs for three months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 0.2 million to 1.6 million from 1.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to the award of executive bonuses based on 2023 results offset in part by the reduction of stock based compensation associated with employee stock options. 
 Depreciation and amortization 
 Depreciation and amortization increased by 0.8 million to 2.3 million from 1.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 primarily due to the change in useful life of mining machines from 5 years to 4 years. 
 Impairment loss on mined digital assets 
 Impairment loss on mined digital assets was nil and 0.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively with no impairment recognized in 2024 due to the implementation of ASC 350-60 effective January 1, 2024. 
 Realized gain on sale of mined digital assets 
 Realized gain on sale of mined digital assets for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was nil and 0.3 million, respectively. 
 Prior to adoption of ASC Topic 350-60 - Intangibles - Goodwill and Other - Crypto Assets, Bitcoin was classified as indefinite-lived intangible assets and were measured at cost less impairment. Additionally, in the previous guidance, subsequent increases in Bitcoin prices are not allowed to be recorded unrealized gains unless the Bitcoin is sold, at which point the gain is recognized. Accordingly, (gains) losses recognized on fair value of Bitcoin in fiscal year 2024 are not comparable to fiscal year 2023. 
 34 

The Company sold 37 Bitcoins during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 107 Bitcoins during the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Other Income (Expense) 
 The Company recognized an unrealized loss on securities of 0.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to an unrealized loss of 0.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 from the revaluation of Seastar's common stock and private placement warrants. 
 The Company recognized 98 thousand of interest income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 40 thousand of interest income for the three months ended September 30, 2023 due to the payoff of a note payable by Seastar Medical in January 2024 while issuing a new loan of 2.8 million to a different entity in 2024. 
 The Company recognized 124 thousand of interest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to nil for the three months ended September 30, 2023 due to an increase in secured borrowings in 2024.

 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company generated a 4.8 million net loss before income taxes and the Company increased its income tax valuation allowance by 1.2 million, which offset the Company s incurred net income tax benefit of 1.2 million which resulted in no income tax expense being recognized for the three months ended September 30, 2024. During the three months ended September 30, 2023, the Company generated a 4.7 million net loss before income taxes and the Company increased its income tax valuation allowance by 1.4 million, which offset the Company s incurred net income tax expense of 1.4 million, resulting in no income tax expense being recognized during the period. 
 Net Loss 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, net loss was 4.8 million as compared to net loss of 4.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Net Loss Attributable to Non-Controlling Interest 
 The Company owns 69.5 of Sponsor. As such, there is a 0.1 million net loss for the three months ended September 30, 2024 attributable to the Non-Controlling Interest as compared to a 0.3 million net loss for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Net Loss Attributable to LM Funding America, Inc. 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, net loss attributable to LM Funding America, Inc. was 4.7 million as compared to net loss of 4.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023.

 The Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 compared with the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 Revenues 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, total revenues increased by 0.1 million, to 9.0 million from 8.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Digital mining revenue increased in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 by 0.3 million to 8.6 million from 8.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Bitcoin mining revenues are determined by two main drivers: quantity of Bitcoin mined and the price of Bitcoin on the date the Bitcoin is mined. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we mined 148.9 Bitcoin with an average Bitcoin price of approximately 58 thousand as compared to 315.4 Bitcoin with an average Bitcoin price of approximately 26 thousand during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in Bitcoin mining revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was attributable to the increase in Bitcoin prices offset in part by the temporary idling of mining machines that were in transit as well as the increased difficulty rate, which reduced our share of the global hashrate. 
 Specialty finance revenue decreased in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 by 190 thousand to 396 thousand from 586 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

Operating Expenses 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, operating expenses increased 0.5 million to 17.7 million from 17.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in operating expenses is primarily due to the following factors: 
 Digital mining cost of revenues 
 Bitcoin mining costs decreased by 1.0 million to 5.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 6.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 due to the temporary idling of mining machines that were in transit and lower hosting costs per machine. 
 Staff costs and payroll 
 Compensation costs for nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by 1.1 million to 3.6 million from 4.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to the reduction of stock based compensation associated with employee stock options offset in part by the award of executive bonuses based on 2023 results. 
 Depreciation and amortization 
 Depreciation and amortization increased by 3.6 million to 7.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 3.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to the increased number of Bitcoin mining machines placed into service earning Bitcoins as well as the change in useful life of mining machines from 5 years to 4 years. 
 Professional fees 
 Professional fees increased by 0.4 million to 1.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 1.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to 0.3 million of contract termination costs paid to a service provider. 
 Loss (gain) on fair value of Bitcoin, net 
 The gain on fair value of Bitcoin, net for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 3.1 million and nil, respectively. As discussed in Note 2 above, the Company adopted the amendments per ASC 350-60 as of January 1, 2024, accordingly, we measured crypto assets at fair value in accordance with ASC Topic 820 - Fair Value Measurement and included the gains and losses from remeasurement in net income. The gain pertains to the change in Bitcoin's fair value from January 1, 2024, through September 30, 2024. The fair value of Bitcoin was approximately 63 thousand per Bitcoin at September 30, 2024 and 42 thousand per Bitcoin at December 31, 2023. 
 Impairment loss on mining equipment 
 The Company incurred a 1.2 million impairment and nil loss on mining equipment for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, related to machines disposed of in April 2024. 
 Impairment loss on mined digital assets 
 Impairment loss on mined digital assets was nil and 0.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively with no impairment recognized in 2024 due to the implementation of ASC 350-60 effective January 1, 2024. 
 Realized gain on sale of mined digital assets 
 Realized gain on sale of mined digital assets for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was nil and 1.3 million respectively. 
 Prior to adoption of ASC 350-60 - Crypto Assets, Bitcoin was classified as indefinite-lived intangible assets and were measured at cost less impairment. Additionally, in the previous guidance, subsequent increases in Bitcoin prices are not allowed to be recorded (unrealized gains) unless the Bitcoin is sold, at which point the gain is recognized. Accordingly, gains (losses) recognized on fair value of Bitcoin in fiscal year 2024 are not comparable to fiscal year 2023. 
 The Company sold 101.5 Bitcoins during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 282.0 Bitcoins during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Other Income (Expense) 
 The Company recognized an unrealized loss on securities of 0.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to an unrealized loss of 10.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 from the revaluation of Seastar's common stock and private placement warrants. 
 The Company recognized 4 thousand on the sale of Bitmain coupons received from the purchase of Bitcoin mining equipment for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 0.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

The Company also recognized an impairment loss of nil and 0.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, related to impairment of Symbiont Assets. 
 The Company recognized 125 thousand of interest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 211 thousand of interest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 due to the payoff of a note payable by Seastar Medical in January 2024 while issuing a new loan of 2.8 million to a different entity in 2024. 
 The Company recognized 232 thousand of interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to nil for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 due to an increase in secured borrowings. 
 Income Tax Expense 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company generated a 9.5 million net loss before income taxes and the Company increased its income tax valuation allowance by 2.4 million, which offset the Company s incurred net income tax benefit of 2.4 million which resulted in no income tax expense being recognized during this period.

During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company generated a 17.5 million net loss before income taxes and the Company increased its income tax valuation allowance by 2.1 million, which offset the Company s incurred net income tax expense of 2.1 million, resulting in no income tax expense being recognized during the period.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 General 
 Our primary sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents, Bitcoin generated from our digital mining operations, proceeds from borrowings and cash from our note receivables. At September 30, 2024, we had cash, cash equivalents and Bitcoin, excluding 5.0 million Bitcoin held as collateral, of 9.9 million compared to cash, cash equivalents and Bitcoin of 5.8 million at December 31, 2023. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, 5.0 million and nil of Bitcoin was pledged as collateral against outstanding borrowings. As of September 30, 2024, we had working capital of 8.2 million reflecting an increase of 0.8 million since December 31, 2023. We have access to equity financing through equity and debt financing. Cash management continues to be a top priority. We expect to incur negative operating cash flows as we work to increase our digital mining revenue and maintain operational efficiencies. 
 Our working capital needs may increase in the future as we continue to expand and enhance our operations. Our ability to raise additional funds for working capital through equity or debt financings or other sources may depend on the financial success of our then current business and successful implementation of our key strategic initiatives, financial, economic and market conditions and other factors, some of which are beyond our control. No assurance can be given that we will be successful in raising the required capital at a reasonable cost and at the required times, or at all. Further equity financings may have a dilutive effect on shareholders and any debt financing, if available, may require restrictions to be placed on our future financing and operating activities. If we require additional capital and are unsuccessful in raising that capital, we may not be able to continue our business operations in the cryptocurrency mining industry which could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.

 Equity Financing Transactions 
 The Company had a cash infusion of 2.3 million and nil from equity financing transactions during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, as described below. 
 On August 16, 2024, the Company and an institutional investor (the Purchaser entered into a securities purchase agreement (the Securities Purchase Agreement ), pursuant to which the Company agreed to issue to the Purchaser, (i) in a registered direct offering, 278,000 shares (the Shares of the Company s common stock and pre-funded warrants to purchase 590,185 shares of common stock (the Pre-Funded Warrants with an exercise price of 0.0001 per share, and (ii) in a concurrent private placement, Series A warrants to purchase 868,185 shares of common stock (the Series A Common Warrants and Series B warrants to purchase 868,185 shares of common stock (the Series B Common Warrants and together with the Series A Common Warrants, the Common Warrants ), each with an exercise price of 2.98. Such registered direct offering and concurrent private placement are referred to herein as the 
 38 

Transactions. The combined effective offering price for each Share (or pre-funded warrant in lieu thereof) and accompanying Series A Warrant and Series B Warrant in the Transaction was 2.98. The Series A Common Warrants will expire on the fifth anniversary of the Stockholder Approval Date and the Series B Common Warrants will expire on the second anniversary of the Stockholder Approval Date. The Pre-Funded Warrants will not expire and will be exercisable commencing on the date of issuance and at any time until all of the Pre-Funded Warrants are exercised in full. The Transactions closed on August 19, 2024. In connection with the Transactions, on August 16, 2024, the Company entered into a placement agency agreement with Maxim Group LLC (the Placement Agent ), pursuant to which the Company engaged the Placement Agent as the exclusive placement agent for the Company. The Company agreed to pay the Placement Agent a cash fee equal to 7.5 of the aggregate gross proceeds raised in the Transactions and reimburse the Placement Agent for certain of its expenses in an aggregate amount up to 60,000. The Company received aggregate gross proceeds from the Transactions of approximately 2.6 million, before deducting fees to the Placement Agent of approximately 0.3 million and other estimated offering expenses payable by the Company of approximately 0.2 million. 
 Certain outstanding and exercisable warrants include price protection provisions requiring a reduction in the instrument's exercise price in the event that the Company subsequently issues shares at a purchase price, or warrants at an exercise price, lower than the instrument's original exercise price. As a result of the Transactions, the provision was triggered and the exercise price of 1,247,807 warrants was reduced from 30.00 to 2.88. In accordance with ASC 260, when an instrument's exercise price is reduced in accordance with a price protection provision, the issuer is required to determine the value that was transferred to the holder of the warrant as calculated by comparing the hypothetical fair value of the warrant immediately before and immediately after the exercise price reduction and record the amount as a reduction to retained earnings and increase to additional paid in capital (i.e. deemed dividend). Due to the absence of retained earnings, the Company recorded the transaction within additional paid in capital, which resulted in a nil net impact to the statements of equity. Loss attributable to common shareholders was increased by the calculated value transferred to the holder of 1.7 million in the basic and diluted EPS calculations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and nil in the basic and diluted EPS calculations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. On September 25, 2024, 149,185 of the Pre-Funded Warrants were exercised for 0.0001 per share. 
 On August 9, 2024, the Company issued 29,674 shares of common stock pursuant to a termination agreement with a service provider which required the delivery of such shares and a cash payment of 150 thousand. The total fair value of the shares at the time of issuance was approximately 100 thousand, of which we expensed 100 thousand and nil for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 Our reported results are presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles GAAP ). We also disclose Earnings before Interest, Tax, Depreciation and Amortization ("EBITDA") and Core Earnings before Interest, Tax, Depreciation and Amortization ("Core EBITDA") which adjusts for unrealized loss on investment and equity securities, impairment loss on mined digital assets, impairment of long-lived assets, impairment of prepaid hosting deposits, contract termination costs and stock compensation expense and option expense, all of which are non-GAAP financial measures. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors because they are widely accepted industry measures used by analysts and investors to compare the operating performance of Bitcoin miners.

Critical Accounting Estimates 
 Our financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or GAAP. The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires our management to make a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure or inclusion of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the period. Our critical accounting policies include revenue recognition, digital assets, and policies related to long-lived assets. We consider our critical accounting estimates to be those related to long-lived asset impairment assessments. 
 There have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates as compared to those disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. For a description of our critical accounting policies and estimates, see Part I, Item 1, Note 1, "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" in our notes to the consolidated financial statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
