SPECIAL
NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 

This
quarterly report on Form 10-Q and the documents incorporated by reference herein contain forward-looking statements that are not statements
of historical fact and may involve a number of risks and uncertainties. These statements related to analyses and other information that
are based on forecasts of future results and estimates of amounts not yet determinable. These statements may also relate to our future
prospects, developments and business strategies. These statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that
may cause our actual results, levels of activity, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, levels
of activity, performance, or achievements expressed or implied by forward-looking statements. 

In
some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as may, should, expects, 
 plans, anticipates, believes, estimates, predicts, potential, 
 proposed, intended, or continue or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology.
You should read statements that contain these words carefully, because they discuss our expectations about our future operating results
or our future financial condition or state other forward-looking information. There may be events in the future that we
are not able to accurately predict or control. Before you invest in our securities, you should be aware that the occurrence of any of
the events described in this quarterly report could substantially harm our business, results of operations and financial condition, and
that upon the occurrence of any of these events, the trading price of our securities could decline and you could lose all or part of
your investment. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee
future results, growth rates, levels of activity, performance or achievements. We are under no duty to update any of the forward-looking
statements after the date of this Annual Report to conform these statements to actual results. 

The
following factors are among those that may cause actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements: 

General
 economic and industry conditions; 

Out
 history of losses, deficits and negative operating cash flows; 

Our
 limited operating history; 

Industry
 competition; 

Environmental
 and governmental regulation; 

Protection
 and defense of our intellectual property rights; 

Reliance
 on, and the ability to attract, key personnel; 

Other
 factors including those discussed in Risk Factors in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q and our incorporated documents. 

You
should keep in mind that any forward-looking statement made by us in this quarterly report or elsewhere speaks only as of the date on
which we make it. New risks and uncertainties arise from time to time, and it is impossible for us to predict these events or how they
may affect us. We have no duty to, and do not intend to, update or revise the forward-looking statements in this annual report after
the date of filing, except as may be required by law. In light of these risks and uncertainties, you should keep in mind that any forward-looking
statement made in this annual report or elsewhere might not occur. 

In
this quarterly report on Form 10-Q, the terms CLOQ, Company, we, us and our 
refer to CyberloQ Technologies, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiary CyberloQ Technologies, LTD.

and internal computer software costs incurred during the application development stage. The application development stage is characterized
by software design and configuration activities, coding, testing and installation. Training costs and maintenance are expensed as incurred,
while upgrades and enhancements are capitalized if it is probable that such expenditures will result in additional functionality. 

In
accounting for website software development costs, we have adopted the provisions of ASC Topic No. 350. ASC Topic No. 350 provides that
certain planning and training costs incurred in the development of website software be expensed as incurred, while application development

a loss of for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Further losses are anticipated in the development of its business. Accordingly,
there is substantial doubt about the entity s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the financial statements
are issued. 

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America, which contemplate continuation of the Company as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments
relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that could
result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

The
ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the Company generating profitable operations in the future and, or, obtaining
the necessary financing to meet its obligations and repay its liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due. 

Management
anticipates that the Company will be dependent, for the near future, on additional investment capital to fund operating expenses. The
Company intends to position itself so that it may be able to raise additional funds through the capital markets. In light of management s
efforts, there are no assurances that the Company will be successful in this or any of its endeavors or become financially viable and
continue as a going concern.

quarter of 2017, the Company acquired the CyberloQ technology and is now the exclusive owner of CyberloQ. 

CyberloQ
is a MFA (Multi Factor Authentication) protocol technology that is offered to institutional clients in order to combat fraudulent transactions
and unauthorized access to customer accounts or any digital asset. Through the use of a customer s smart-phone, CyberloQ uses a
multi-factor authentication system to control access to a bank card, transaction type or amount, website, database or digital service.
The mobile applications for CyberloQ have been built, and have been successfully integrated into the banking ecosystem. The Company has
also updated the entire infrastructure, UI/UX and streamlined the deliverable services per strategic partnerships with clients in multiple
channels in order to increase the scalability of the original platform. 

In
addition to CyberloQ, the Company offers a web-based proprietary software platform under the brand name TurnScor which allows customers
to monitor and manage their credit from the privacy of their own homes. Although individuals can sign-up for TurnScor on their own, the
Company also intends to market TurnScor to certain institutional clients, where appropriate, in conjunction with CyberloQ as a value-added
benefit to offer their customers. 

The
CyberloQ Vault is a cloud based security protocol that allows clients the ability to send/receive secure data without having
to use traditional e-mail which is prone to a breach. This CyberloQ service uses cloud-based encryption and a secure web portal to send/receive
confidential data, the sender and receiver both must have authenticated their position within the prescribed geo coordinates as well
as authenticate their mobile devices prior to sending/receiving any data. Thus, rendering a hack or breach utterly useless for the encrypted
data is unusable without the CyberloQ authentication component. 

The
Company currently has two full-time employees its President and Vice-President. There are no other employees of the Company at
this time. 

The
Company also has a Board of Advisors comprised of individuals from the banking, business development, and technical sectors to advise
the Company as it moves forward with its business strategy. The Board of Advisors does not have any decision-making authority.

Liquidity,
Capital Resources and Material Changes in Financial Condition 

As
of September 30, 2024, the Company s assets were 1,670,307 compared to 1,458,565 in assets as of December 31, 2023. 

This
change in the Company s financial condition can be primarily attributed to an increase in fixed assets of 335,894 due to the capitalization
of the Cyberloq Platform and website development, and an increase in the Company s prepaid expense from 44,564 to 46,231. This
increase in fixed assets was partially offset by a decrease in the Company s cash assets to 190,155 as of September 30, 2024 as
opposed to 307,174 as of December 31, 2023, and a decrease in the company s accounts receivable from 10,000 to 0. 

As
of September 30, 2024, the Company s liabilities were 2,495,078 compared to 1,021,359 in liabilities as of December 31, 2023.
This change in the Company s financial condition can be primarily attributed to an increase in convertible debt of 556,859, related
to the Company raising operating capital through the issuance of convertible notes. Additionally, as a result of adoption of ASU 2020-06
a cumulative adjustment of 481,181 was recognized. In addition, there was a decrease of 37,631 in accounts payable and accrued expenses,
along with an increase of 169,209 in accrued interest. 

Net
cash used in operating activities for the nine-month period ending September 30, 2024 was 461,784 compared to 262,541 for 2023. Cash
provided by or used by operating activities is driven by our net loss and adjusted by noncash items as well as changes in operating assets
and liabilities. At September 30, 2024, there was 79,000 in stock compensation and 25,000 in bad debt. 

Net
cash used by investing activities was 337,094 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 554,997 for 2023. 

Net
cash provided by financing activities was 681,859 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 859,250 for 2023. 

The
Company had gross revenue of 15,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to gross revenue of 993 for the nine months
ended September 30, 2023, and is currently reliant on its ability to raise additional capital to continue execution of its business plan
to move the Company forward towards profitability. The Company does not anticipate any significant decrease in its operating expenses
for the remainder of 2024. Unless the Company begins to generate operational revenue, it will be reliant on its ability to raise additional
capital in order to continue its operations. 

Results
of Operations for the nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 

Company
revenue was 15,000 in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 993 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

The
Company s operating expenses were 517,419 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 272,596 for the nine months
ended September 30, 2023. 

This
increase in operating expenses was primarily due to an increase in professional fees which were 228,486 for the nine months ended September
30, 2024, compared to 69,489 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This increase in professional fees was due to the fact that
in the first nine months ended September 30, 2024 the Company had increased professional fees related to increased software development
costs associated with upgrading the source code and infrastructure to accommodate increased capacity demands. 

In
addition, the Company experienced changes in expense categories as noted below. 

Officers 
compensation was 182,500 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 142,500 for the nine months ended September 30,
2023. This increase was due to the officers monthly salary increasing as of July 31, 2023. 

Computer
and internet expenses were 33,443 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 14,266 for the nine months ended September
30, 2023. 

Other
operating expenses were 48,859 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 28,827 for the nine months ended September
30,2023. This increase in other operating expenses was due to the recognition of bad debt. 

Office
supplies and expenses were 10,216 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 7,415 for the nine months ended September
30, 2023. 

Travel
and entertainment expenses were 6,510 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 2,939 for the nine months ended September
30, 2023. 

Finally,
there was no material changes in the Company s rent expense in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine
months ended September 30, 2023. 

As
a result of the foregoing, the Company experienced a net loss from operations of 502,419 in the nine months ended September 30, 2024
compared to a net loss from operations of 271,603 in the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

Company
revenue was 0 in the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 0 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 

The
Company s operating expenses were 144,365 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 81,422 for the three months
ended September 30, 2023. This increase in operating expenses was primarily due to an increase in professional fees which was 60,162
for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 17,181 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 related to increased
software development costs associated with upgrading the source code and infrastructure to accommodate increased capacity demands. 

In
addition, there was an increase in computer and internet expense which was 15,664 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared
to 5,937 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 

There
was also an increase in officer compensation which was 60,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 52,500 for
the three months ended September 30, 2023 due to the Board of Directors approving a salary increase for the Company s President
in 2023. 

In
addition, the Company experienced changes in expense categories as noted below. 

Travel
expenses were 1,779 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 226 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 

Finally,
there were no material changes in the Company s office supplies and expenses, rent and other operating expense in the three months
ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. 

As
a result of the foregoing, the Company experienced a net loss from operations of 144,365 in the three months ended September 30, 2024
compared to a net loss from operations of 81,422 in the three months ended September 30, 2023 

Item
3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 

The
Company qualifies as a smaller reporting company as defined by 229.10(f)(1) and therefore is not required to provide the information
required by this Item. 

ITEM
4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining a system of disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e)
and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) that is designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that
we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Commission s
rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information
required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated
to the issuer s management, including its principal executive officer or officers and principal financial officer or officers,
or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

An
evaluation was conducted under the supervision and with the participation of our management of the effectiveness of the design and operation
of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024 in accordance with Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission s 2013 Integrated Framework. Based on that evaluation, our management concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures
were not effective as of such date to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the
Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms. In addition,
due to its current size, the Company currently does not have sufficient staff to maintain appropriate segregation of duties, as it pertains
to application and oversight of internal control processes. Material weaknesses have previously been identified, including lack of segregation
of duties and lack of formal written policies and procedures surrounding financial close and reporting. However, the Company anticipates
that as it grows and formalizes its internal control processes and procedures, it will add sufficient staff to perform internal control
processes, as well as adequately provided oversight to ensure processes are working as designed. Such officer also confirmed that there
was no change in our internal control over financial reporting during the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 that has materially
affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

OTHER
INFORMATION 

Item
1. Legal Proceedings 

The
Company is not currently a party to any legal proceedings, nor is the Company a party to any administrative proceedings. 

In
addition, the Company s officers and directors have not been convicted in any criminal proceedings nor have they been permanently
or temporarily enjoined, barred, suspended or otherwise limited from involvement in any type of securities or banking activities. 

Item
1A. Risk Factors 

The
Company qualifies as a smaller reporting company as defined by 229.10(f)(1) and therefore is not required to provide the information
required by this Item. However, the Company does acknowledge that there are risks associated with the business of the Company. 

We
will be competing with a variety of companies, many of which have significantly greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources
than us. If we fail to attract and retain a large base of customers for our products, or if our competitors establish a more prominent
market position relative to ours, this will inhibit our ability to grow and successfully execute our business plan. For example, Wells
Fargo has introduced an on/off feature for their customers, Discover Card has Freeze It functionality, and
Ondot Systems has already been operating in the mobile card security space for quite some time. However, the Company believes that the
multi-purpose functionality of CyberloQ, along with its multi-purpose applications will give the Company a distinct advantage by comparison.
CyberloQ can be used in the banking system to protect debit/credit cards, in the health care industry to protect PII (Personal Identifying
Information) now that medical records are kept digitally, and can protect corporate data bases in any industry from outside intrusion
via geo-fencing. The Company believes that these distinct features, along with the ability to White Label the technology
for marketing partners, give the Company a distinction in the marketplace. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to
successfully compete with other companies in the marketplace. 

In
addition, the Company could incur increased costs, decreased revenue, or suffer reputational damage in the event of a cyber-attack. The
Company s business involves the collection, storage, processing and transmission of customers personal data, including financial
information. In the event that the Company s security measures are breached due to human error, malfeasance, system errors or vulnerabilities,
or other irregularities, such breach could adversely affect our business through possible interruption of the Company s operations,
improper disclosure of data, damage to the Company s reputation, and/or legal exposure.

Item
2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS 

During
the first nine months of 2024, the Company raised 125,000 for the operations of the Company through the unregistered sale of 2,400,000
shares of restricted common stock. 

All
of the shares described above were issued by the Company in reliance upon an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities
Act of 1933, as amended, provided by Section 4(2). All of the purchasers of the unregistered securities were all known to us and our
management, through pre-existing business relationships, as long standing business associates, friends, and employees. All purchasers
were provided access to all public material information, which they requested, and all information necessary to verify such information
and were afforded access to our management in connection with their purchases. All purchasers of the unregistered securities acquired
such securities for investment and not with a view toward distribution, acknowledging such intent to us. All certificates or agreements
representing such securities that were issued contained restrictive legends, prohibiting further transfer of the certificates or agreements
representing such securities, without such securities either being first registered or otherwise exempt from registration in any further
resale or disposition. 

ITEM
3. DEFAULTS UPON SENIOR SECURITIES 

The
Company is not in default on any financing arrangements at this time. 

ITEM
4. OTHER INFORMATION
