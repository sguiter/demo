 million as of September 30, 2024. The Company anticipates incurring additional losses until such time, if ever, that it can generate significant revenues from its current or any future product candidates. The Company believes its cash and cash equivalents of million as of September 30, 2024 are sufficient to fund its projected operations for a period of at least 12 months from the issuance date of these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. Substantial additional funding will be needed by the Company to fund its operations and to commercially develop its current and any future product candidates. 
 
 Management plans to seek additional capital in the future through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations, strategic transactions and/or marketing, distribution or licensing arrangements to carry out the Company s planned development activities. If additional capital is not available when required, the Company may need to delay or curtail its operations until such funding is received. There is no assurance that such financing will be available when needed or on acceptable terms. Various internal and external factors will affect whether and when the Company s current or any future product candidates become approved for marketing and successful commercialization. The regulatory approval and market acceptance of the Company s current and any future product candidates, length of time and cost of developing and commercializing these product candidates and/or failure of them at any stage of the approval process will materially affect the Company s financial condition and future operations. 
 
 The Company faces risks associated with companies whose products are in development. These risks include the need for additional financing to complete its research and development, achieving its research and development objectives, defending its intellectual property rights, recruiting and retaining skilled personnel, and dependence on key members of management, among others.

 You should read the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations together with our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and other financial information included in this report and our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, as filed with the SEC on March 21, 2024. In addition to historical information, the following discussion contains a number of forward-looking statements, all of which are based on our current expectations and could be affected by the uncertainties and risks referred to under Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors of our Annual Report on Form 10-K. Please also see the section entitled Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements. 
 
 Overview 
 We are a biopharmaceutical company advancing T cell engaging TCE bispecific antibodies for solid tumors. We are building an innovative portfolio of TCE bispecific therapeutics, including CTIM-76, a CLDN6 x CD3 bsAb, CT-95, an MSLN x CD3 bsAb, and CT-202, a Nectin-4 x CD3 bsAb. 
 
 CTIM-76 is a CLDN6 x CD3 bispecific antibody that is intended to redirect T-cell-mediated lysis toward malignant cells expressing CLDN6. CLDN6 is a tight junction membrane protein target expressed in multiple solid tumors and absent from or expressed at low levels in healthy adult tissues. Investigational New Drug IND )-enabling studies on CTIM-76 have been completed. On May 2, 2024, we announced the FDA cleared our IND application to support the initiation of a Phase 1 dose escalation and expansion trial of CTIM-76 in patients with CLDN6-positive gynecologic and testicular cancers. We anticipate dosing the first patient in the CTIM-76 Phase 1 trial by the end of 2024. We expect to share initial data for the CTIM-76 Phase 1 trial in the first half of 2026. 
 
 On September 23, 2024, we entered into a license agreement (the BioAtla License Agreement with BioAtla, Inc. ("Bioatla"), pursuant to which we obtained an exclusive, worldwide license to develop, manufacture and commercialize two licensed antibodies (the BioAtla Assets ), including BA3362 (renamed by the Company as CT-202), BioAtla s Nectin-4 x CD3 TCE bispecific antibody. 
 
 As partial consideration for the exclusive license under the BioAtla License Agreement, we made an upfront payment of 11.0 million, and BioAtla is eligible to receive up to 122.5 million in additional milestone payments based upon the achievement of specified pre-clinical, clinical, development and commercial milestones, as well as tiered mid-single digit to low double-digit royalties on future net sales for products containing the BioAtla Assets, subject to standard reductions. 
 
 CT-202 targets Nectin-4, which is highly and frequently overexpressed in a variety of cancers. Nectin-4 is a clinically-validated target for cancer therapy using a traditional antibody-drug conjugate, but it is also associated with certain adverse events, including neuropathy and rash. CT-202 is a Conditionally Active Biologic T cell engager that is designed to be preferentially active within the tumor microenvironment. We expect to file an IND application for CT-202 in the middle of 2026. 
 
 On July 9, 2024, we entered into an asset purchase agreement (the Asset Purchase Agreement pursuant to which we acquired CT-95 (formerly known as LNK-101), from Link (assignment for the benefit of creditors), LLC Link ), which succeeded to the assets of Link Immunotherapeutics Inc. The FDA previously cleared the IND application for CT-95. 
 
 Pursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement, we purchased all of the assets of Link associated with CT-95, including patent rights, know-how, regulatory filings, and inventory of drug substance and drug product (the Transferred Assets ), on an as is and where is basis. CT-95 patents are currently being prosecuted and/or maintained in the United States, Europe, Canada, Australia and Taiwan. We also assumed certain liabilities relating to the Transferred Assets. In consideration of the purchase of the Transferred Assets, we made a one-time payment to Link of 3.75 million. 
 
 CT-95 is an MSLN x CD3 bispecific antibody that is intended to redirect T-cell-mediated lysis toward malignant cells expressing MSLN. MSLN is a membrane protein overexpressed in approximately 30 of cancers. One challenge in developing MSLN-targeted therapies has been the presence of MSLN fragments, also referred to as shed MSLN, found in both blood and the tumor microenvironment that can serve as a decoy or sink for MSLN-targeting antibodies. CT-95 is a fully humanized bispecific T cell engager that has a relatively low affinity but high avidity for membrane-bound MSLN, minimizing the impact

 of the shed MSLN. CT-95 is being developed as a therapy for advanced cancers associated with MSLN expression, including ovarian, lung, pancreatic, and mesothelioma. We expect to dose the first patient in the CT-95 Phase 1 trial in the first quarter of 2025. We expect to share initial data for the CT-95 Phase 1 trial in the middle of 2026. 
 
 On May 1, 2024, we entered into a securities purchase agreement (the Purchase Agreement for the private placement (the Private Placement of (i) 59,032,259 shares (the Shares of our common stock at a purchase price of 1.55 per Share, and (ii) pre-funded warrants (the Pre-Funded Warrants to purchase 5,482,741 shares of common stock (the Warrant Shares at a purchase price of 1.549 per Pre-Funded Warrant. The Pre-Funded Warrants have an exercise price of 0.001 per share of common stock, are immediately exercisable and remain exercisable until exercised in full. The aggregate gross proceeds for the Private Placement were approximately 100 million, before deducting offering expenses of 5.2 million, and the Private Placement closed on May 6, 2024. We expect to have sufficient cash and cash equivalents to fund the estimated duration of the dose escalation portions of our CTIM-76 and CT-95 Phase 1 trials, the estimated expenses through IND filing for CT-202, as well as our operations into 2027. 
 
 In addition, pursuant to a registration rights agreement dated May 1, 2024 (the Registration Rights Agreement ), we filed a registration statement for purposes of registering the resale of the Shares (including the Warrant Shares) (the Registration Statement ), which was declared effective by the SEC on May 31, 2024. We agreed to use our reasonable best efforts to keep the Registration Statement effective until the date that all registrable securities covered by the Registration Statement (i) have been sold, thereunder or pursuant to Rule 144, or (ii) may be sold by a non-affiliate without volume or manner-of-sale restrictions pursuant to Rule 144 and without the requirement for us to be in compliance with the current public information requirement under Rule 144. 
 
 On February 29, 2024, we amended the Research Collaboration and License Agreement (the Integral License Agreement with Integral Molecular, Inc. Integral to reflect updated financial terms. In the course of our further due diligence review of CTIM-76, we determined that certain of the licensed rights under the Integral License Agreement may incorporate intellectual property rights currently held by a third party. Specifically, we are aware of issued patents in the United States and certain foreign jurisdictions expiring in January 2034 that potentially cover certain of the intellectual property included in CTIM-76. While we believe we will have reasonable defenses against any potential claim of infringement, we may not be successful in such efforts, and we also may not be able to obtain a license to such patent on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. 
 
 As part of the Second Amendment, Integral s right to receive certain future payments was reduced as follows: aggregate development and regulatory milestone payments were reduced from 55 million to 15 million, aggregate sales milestone payments were reduced from 130 million to 12.5 million, and a tiered royalty of 8-12 that commenced at first commercial sale was reduced to a flat royalty rate of 6 on net sales beginning no sooner than February 1, 2034. The Second Amendment also narrowed the license grant from Integral to us to only cover CTIM-76, removed any further obligation of us to reimburse Integral for any independently obtained research funding Integral applied against CTIM-76 research, and included mutual releases by the parties. 
 
 The reduced development and regulatory milestones now reflect a payment due at each of: first patient s first screening visit in a Phase 1b/2 or Phase 2 clinical trial for CTIM-76, first patient s first screening visit in a Phase 3 clinical trial for CTIM-76, United States marketing approval for CTIM-76, European Union marketing approval for CTIM-76, United Kingdom marketing approval for CTIM-76, and Japan marketing approval for CTIM-76. The amended commercial milestones now also reflect a payment due upon the achievement of annual net sales of 500 million and annual net sales of 1 billion. 
 
 On March 22, 2023, we announced a portfolio prioritization and capital allocation strategy, including discontinuing the development of ONA-XR and focusing on the development of CTIM-76. Based upon the challenging market conditions for emerging companies, the increasingly competitive landscape for breast cancer treatments, recent study findings, and other factors, we decided to cease development and explore strategic options for ONA-XR. As a result, we no longer primarily focus on female cancers. 
 
 We were incorporated in April 2015 under the laws of the State of Delaware. Since inception, we have devoted substantially all of our resources to developing product and technology rights, conducting research and development, organizing and staffing our company, business planning and raising capital. We operate as one business segment and have incurred recurring losses, the majority of which are attributable to research and development activities, and negative cash flows from operations. We have funded our operations primarily through the sale of common stock, warrants, convertible debt, and convertible preferred stock. Our net loss was 23.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of 91.4 million.

Currently, our primary use of cash is to fund operating expenses, which consist primarily of research and development expenditures, as well as general and administrative expenditures. Our ability to generate product revenue sufficient to achieve profitability will depend heavily on the successful development and eventual commercialization of one or more of our current or any future product candidates. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses and operating losses for the foreseeable future as we advance our current and any future product candidates through all stages of development and clinical trials and, ultimately, seek regulatory approval. In addition, if we obtain regulatory approval for any product candidate, we expect to incur significant commercialization expenses related to product manufacturing, marketing, sales and distribution. Furthermore, we have incurred and continue to incur significant costs associated with operating as a public company, including legal, accounting, investor relations and other expenses. Our net losses may fluctuate significantly from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year, depending on the timing of our clinical trials and our expenses on other research and development activities. 
 We expect to continue to incur net operating losses for at least the next several years, and we expect our research and development expenses, general and administrative expenses, and capital expenditures will continue to increase. We expect our expenses and capital requirements will increase significantly in connection with our ongoing activities as we: 
 continue nonclinical studies and initiate clinical trials for CTIM-76, CT-95, CT-202, and for any additional product candidates that we may pursue; 
 continue to scale up external manufacturing capacity with the aim of securing sufficient quantities to meet our capacity requirements for clinical trials and potential commercialization; 
 establish a sales, marketing and distribution infrastructure to commercialize any approved product candidate and related additional commercial manufacturing costs; 
 develop, maintain, expand, protect and enforce our intellectual property portfolio, including patents, trade secrets and know how; 
 acquire or in-license other product candidates and technologies, including related upfront, milestone and royalty payments; 
 attract, hire and retain additional executive officers, clinical, scientific, quality control, and manufacturing management and administrative personnel; 
 add clinical, operational, financial and management information systems and personnel, including personnel to support our product development and planned future commercialization efforts; 
 expand our operations in the United States and to other geographies; and 
 incur additional legal, accounting, investor relations and other expenses associated with operating as a public company. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of 84.8 million, which we expect will be sufficient to fund our operations into 2027. If the Company is unable to obtain additional financing, the lack of liquidity could have a material adverse effect on the Company s future prospects. 
 
 We will need to raise substantial additional capital to support our continuing operations and pursue our growth strategy. Until such time as we can generate significant revenue from product sales, if ever, we plan to finance our operations through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations, strategic transactions and/or marketing, distribution or licensing arrangements. There are no assurances that we will be successful in obtaining an adequate level of financing as and when needed to finance our operations on terms acceptable to us, or at all. Any failure to raise capital as and when needed could have a negative impact on our financial condition and on our ability to pursue our business plans and strategies. If we are unable to secure adequate additional funding, we may have to significantly delay, scale back or discontinue the development and commercialization of one or more product candidates or delay our pursuit of potential in-licenses or acquisitions.

 Components of Our Results of Operations 
 Operating Expenses 
 Research and Development Expenses 
 Research and development expenses have consisted primarily of costs incurred in connection with the discovery and development of our product candidates. We expense research and development costs as incurred, including: 
 expenses incurred to conduct the necessary discovery-stage laboratory work, preclinical studies and clinical trials required to obtain regulatory approval; 
 personnel expenses, including salaries, benefits and share-based compensation expense for our employees and consultants engaged in research and development functions; 
 costs of funding research performed by third parties, including pursuant to agreements with contract research organizations CROs that conduct our clinical trials, as well as investigative sites, consultants and CROs that conduct our preclinical and clinical studies; 
 expenses incurred under agreements with contract manufacturing organizations, including manufacturing scale-up expenses, milestone-based payments, and the cost of acquiring and manufacturing preclinical study and clinical trial materials; 
 fees paid to consultants who assist with research and development activities; 
 license payments and acquisitions of IPR D assets that have no alternative future use; 
 expenses related to regulatory activities, including filing fees paid to regulatory agencies; and 
 allocated expenses for facility costs, including rent, utilities and maintenance. 
 We track outsourced development costs and other external research and development costs to specific product candidates on a program-by-program basis. However, we do not track our internal research and development expenses on a program-by-program basis as they primarily relate to compensation, early research and other costs which are deployed across multiple projects under development. 
 Research and development activities are central to our business model. Product candidates in later stages of clinical development generally have higher development costs than those in earlier stages of clinical development, primarily due to the increased size and duration of later-stage clinical trials. We expect our research and development expenses to increase significantly over the next several years as we increase personnel costs, including share-based compensation, conduct our clinical trials, including later-stage clinical trials, for current and any future product candidates and prepare regulatory filings for our current and any future product candidates. 
 General and Administrative Expenses 
 General and administrative expenses have consisted primarily of personnel expenses, including salaries, benefits and share-based compensation expense, for employees and consultants in executive, finance and accounting, legal, operations support, information technology and business development functions. General and administrative expense also includes corporate facility costs not otherwise included in research and development expense, including rent, utilities and insurance, as well as legal fees related to intellectual property and corporate matters and fees for accounting and consulting services. 
 We expect that our general and administrative expenses will increase in the future to support our continued research and development activities, potential commercialization efforts and increased costs of operating as a public company. These increases will likely include increased costs related to the hiring of additional personnel and fees to outside consultants, legal support and accountants, among other expenses. Additionally, we will continue to incur significant costs associated with being a public company, including expenses related to services associated with maintaining compliance with the requirements of Nasdaq and the SEC, insurance and investor relations costs. If any of our current or future product candidates obtain U.S. regulatory approval, we expect that we would incur significantly increased expenses associated with building a sales and marketing team.

 ONA-XR income of 17,363 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 was due to actual closeout costs incurred being less than the estimated close out costs recorded as of June 30, 2023, following our decision in March 2023 to discontinue the development of ONA-XR and focus on the development of CTIM-76. CTIM-76 expenditures decreased by 2.8 million, primarily due to a decrease of 3.5 million in contract manufacturing costs and preclinical costs, partially offset by an increase of 0.8 million in clinical costs as a result of initiating our Phase 1 clinical trial. CT-95 expense of 4.0 million primarily represents consideration paid of 3.75 million to acquire the asset from Link in July 2024 and approximately 0.2 million in other preclinical expenses incurred. CT-202 expense of 11.0 million primarily represents consideration paid under the BioAtla

 License Agreement entered into in September 2024. Personnel-related costs, which include salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation expense, increased by approximately 0.1 million, primarily due to higher headcount over the prior year period. 
 
 General and Administrative Expenses 
 
 General and administrative expenses increased by approximately 0.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023. The increase was primarily driven by an increase in professional fees of 0.2 million for legal services incurred during the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Interest Income 
 Interest income increased by approximately 1.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023 primarily due to higher cash and cash equivalent balances due to the Private Placement. 
 
 Other (expense) income 
 Other expense was 2,152 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to other income of 15,369 for the same period in 2023, primarily due to higher foreign currency losses as a result of exchange rate fluctuations on transactions denominated in a currency other than our functional currency.

Table of Contents 

 The decrease in ONA-XR expense of 1.9 million was due to the decision in March 2023 to discontinue the development of ONA-XR and focus on the development of CTIM-76. CTIM-76 expenditures decreased by 4.9 million, primarily due to a decrease of 6.8 million in preclinical and contract manufacturing costs, partially offset by an increase of 1.7 million in clinical and regulatory costs as a result of initiating our Phase 1 clinical trial. CT-95 expense of 4.0 million primarily represents consideration paid of 3.75 million to acquire the asset from Link in July 2024 and approximately 0.2 million in other preclinical expenses incurred. CT-202 expense of 11.0 million primarily represents consideration paid under the BioAtla License Agreement entered into in September 2024. Personnel-related costs, which include salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation expense, decreased by approximately 0.5 million, primarily due to lower average headcount over the prior year period. 
 
 General and Administrative Expenses 
 
 General and administrative expenses decreased by approximately 0.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023. The decrease was primarily driven by decreases in compensation and share-based compensation costs of 0.3 million and insurance expense of 0.2 million. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in professional fees of 0.2 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Interest Income 
 Interest income increased by approximately 1.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023 primarily due to higher cash and cash equivalent balances due to the Private Placement. 
 
 Other expense 
 Other expense was 4,906 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to other income of 5,830 for the same period in 2023, primarily due to higher foreign currency losses as a result of exchange rate fluctuations on transactions denominated in a currency other than our functional currency. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Overview 
 
 Since our inception, we have not recognized any revenue and have incurred operating losses and negative cash flows from our operations. We have not yet commercialized any product and we do not expect to generate revenue from sales of any products for several years, if at all. Since our inception through September 30, 2024, we have funded our operations through the sale of common stock, warrants, convertible debt, and convertible preferred stock. As of September 30, 2024, we had 84.8 million in cash and cash equivalents and an accumulated deficit of 91.4 million. 
 
 We expect our cash and cash equivalents at September 30, 2024 to fund the estimated duration of the dose escalation portions of our CTIM-76 and CT-95 Phase 1 trials, the estimated expenses through IND filing for CT-202, as well as our operations into 2027. We have based these estimates on assumptions that may prove to be imprecise, and we could utilize our available capital resources sooner than we expect. 
 Funding Requirements 
 Our primary use of cash is to fund operating expenses, which consist of research and development expenditures and various general and administrative expenses. Cash used to fund operating expenses is impacted by the timing of when we pay these expenses, as reflected in the change in our outstanding accounts payable, accrued expenses and prepaid expenses. 
 Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with research, development and commercialization of pharmaceutical products, we are unable to estimate the exact amount of our operating capital requirements. Our future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to: 
 the scope, timing, progress and results of discovery, preclinical development, laboratory testing and clinical trials for our current and any future product candidates that we may pursue; 
 25 

Table of Contents 

 the costs of manufacturing our current and any future product candidates for clinical trials and in preparation for regulatory approval and commercialization; 
 the extent to which we enter into collaborations or other arrangements with additional third parties in order to further develop our current and any future product candidates that we may pursue; 
 the costs of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining and enforcing our intellectual property rights and defending intellectual property-related claims; 
 the costs and fees associated with the discovery, acquisition or in-license of additional product candidates or technologies; 
 expenses needed to attract and retain skilled personnel; 
 costs associated with being a public company; 
 the costs required to scale up our clinical, regulatory and manufacturing capabilities; 
 the costs of future commercialization activities, if any, including establishing sales, marketing, manufacturing and distribution capabilities, for our current and any future product candidates for which we receive regulatory approval; and 
 revenue, if any, received from commercial sales of our current and any future product candidates, should any of our product candidates receive regulatory approval. 
 
 We will need additional funds to meet our operational needs and capital requirements for clinical trials, other research and development expenditures, and general and administrative expenses. We currently have no credit facility or committed sources of capital. 
 Until such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial product revenue, we expect to finance our operations through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations, strategic transactions and/or marketing, distribution or licensing arrangements. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the ownership interests of our stockholders will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of our common stockholders. Debt financing and preferred equity financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making acquisitions or capital expenditures or declaring dividends. If we raise additional funds through collaborations, strategic transactions or marketing, distribution or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs or product candidates, or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings or other arrangements when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our research, product development or future commercialization efforts, or grant rights to develop and market product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves.

 Cash Flows 
 The following table shows a summary of our cash flows for the periods indicated: 
 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Cash used in operating activities (9,649,702) (13,820,446) Cash used in investing activities (14,757,316) Cash provided by financing activities 94,758,747 Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents 70,351,729 (13,820,446) 
 Comparison of the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 Operating Activities 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we used 9.6 million of cash in operating activities. Cash used in operating activities reflected our net loss of 23.4 million and a change in our operating assets and liabilities of 1.7 million, partially offset by in-process research and development charges of 14.8 million and non-cash share-based compensation expense of 0.6 million. The primary uses of cash were to fund our operations related to the development of our product candidates. 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we used 13.8 million of cash in operating activities. Cash used in operating activities reflected our net loss of 17.2 million, partially offset by a change in our operating assets and liabilities of 2.5 million and non-cash share-based compensation expense of 0.8 million. The primary uses of cash were to fund our operations related to the development of our product candidates. 
 
 Investing Activities 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, cash used in investing activities was primarily attributable to a one-time payment of 3.75 million made to Link to acquire the assets associated with CT-95 and a payment of 11.0 million under the BioAtla License Agreement for the development of CT-202. In addition, we used 7,000 of cash to purchase property and equipment. 
 
 We did not have cash flows from investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Financing Activities 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, financing activities provided 94.8 million, consisting of net proceeds from the sale of common stock and Pre-Funded Warrants in the Private Placement. 
 
 We did not have cash flows from financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 During the periods presented, we did not have, nor do we currently have, any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, including entities sometimes referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, that were established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. We do not engage in off-balance sheet financing arrangements. In addition, we do not engage in trading activities involving non-exchange traded contracts. We therefore believe that we are not materially exposed to any financing, liquidity, market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in these relationships.

 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, there were no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates from those described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, as filed with the SEC on March 21, 2024. 
 
 Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
 See Note 3 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements found elsewhere in this Quarterly Report for a description of recent accounting pronouncements applicable to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 
 Emerging Growth Company and Smaller Reporting Company Status 
 In April 2012, the JOBS Act was enacted. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, for complying with new or revised accounting standards. Thus, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to avail ourselves of this exemption from complying with new or revised accounting standards and, therefore, will not be subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies. As a result, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with new or revised accounting pronouncements as of public company effective dates. 
 
 Other exemptions and reduced reporting requirements under the JOBS Act include, without limitation, the requirements for providing an auditor s attestation report on our system of internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, an exemption from any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation, and less extensive disclosure about our executive compensation arrangements. We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier to occur of (a) the last day of the fiscal year (i) following October 19, 2026, (ii) in which we have total annual gross revenues of at least 1.235 billion or (iii) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer under the rules of the SEC, which means that we have been required to file annual and quarterly reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), for a period of at least 12 months and have filed at least one annual report pursuant to the Exchange Act and (b) either (i) the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds 700.0 million as of the prior June 30th, or (ii) the date on which we have issued more than 1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during the prior three-year period. 
 
 We are also a smaller reporting company, meaning that the market value of our stock held by non-affiliates is less than 700.0 million and our annual revenue was less than 100.0 million during the most recently completed fiscal year. We will continue to be a smaller reporting company while either (i) the market value of our stock held by non-affiliates is less than 250.0 million or (ii) our annual revenue is less than 100.0 million during the most recently completed fiscal year and the market value of our stock held by non-affiliates is less than 700.0 million. If we are a smaller reporting company at the time we cease to be an emerging growth company, we may continue to rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements that are available to smaller reporting companies. Specifically, as a smaller reporting company we may choose to present only the two most recent fiscal years of audited financial statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K and, similar to emerging growth companies, smaller reporting companies have reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation.

 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 We are a smaller reporting company as defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information otherwise required under this Item 3. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer, evaluated, as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act. The term disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. 
 
 Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures as of such date were effective at the reasonable assurance level. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 From time to time, we may become involved in legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of our business. We 
 are not presently a party to any material legal proceedings. 
 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 Investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. In addition to the other information set forth in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, you should carefully consider the factors described under the caption "Risk Factors" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on March 21, 2024.

In such an event, the market price of our common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may impair our business operations.

Each respective Inducement Grants will vest as to 25 of the shares on the first anniversary of the date of grant and in successive equal monthly installments over the subsequent three years, subject to continued employment with the Company and the terms and conditions in the stock option agreement. The options were granted pursuant to the exemption contained in Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933. 
 
 Item 3. Defaults upon Senior Securities 
 None. 
 
 Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures 
 Not applicable.
