 million goodwill balance was not impaired. 
 Our interim Step One Analysis was completed using a combination of the market approach and a discounted cash flow analysis. The market approach was completed to determine the fair value of the Europe Surface Transportation business, excluding its proprietary technology platform, and was equal to the agreed-upon sale price of the business. As the sale does not include a technology platform necessary to run the business, a discounted cash flow analysis was completed to determine the fair value of the Europe Surface Transportation proprietary technology platform. The computed fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its carrying value. We will continue to monitor any changes to the assumptions included in our discounted cash flow analysis in future periods as needed although as noted in Note 14, Divestitures , the sale of the Europe Surface Transportation disposal group is expected to be completed near the end of 2024.

 Assets and liabilities held for sale - On July 27, 2024, we entered into an agreement to sell our Europe Surface Transportation business. The sale will include all assets and liabilities of the business other than our proprietary technology platform. As a result of the planned divestiture the Europe Surface Transportation disposal group is classified as held for sale as of September 30, 2024. The Company measured the disposal group at its fair value less costs incurred to sell and recorded a million loss on the disposal group in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. The fair value of the assets and liabilities held for sale are classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy based on the negotiated sale price which is an observable market-based input. The sale is anticipated to close near the end of 2024. Refer to Note 14, Divestitures , for further discussion related to the sale of our Europe Surface Transportation business. 
 We had other Level 2 or Level 3 assets or liabilities as of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023. There were no transfers between levels during the period.

 SENIOR UNSECURED REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY 
 We have a senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the Credit Agreement with a total availability of billion, which may be reduced by standby letters of credit. The Credit Agreement has a maturity date of November 19, 2027. Borrowings under the Credit Agreement generally bear interest at a variable rate determined by a pricing schedule or the base rate (which is the highest of (a) the administrative agent's prime rate, (b) the federal funds rate plus percent, or (c) the sum of one-month SOFR plus a specified margin). As of September 30, 2024, the variable rate equaled SOFR and a credit spread adjustment of percent plus percent. In addition, there is a commitment fee on the average daily undrawn stated amount under the facility ranging from percent to percent. The recorded amount of borrowings outstanding, if any, approximates fair value because of the short maturity period of the debt; therefore, we consider these borrowings to be a Level 2 financial liability. 
 The Credit Agreement contains various restrictions and covenants that require us to maintain certain financial ratios, including a maximum leverage ratio of to 1.00. The Credit Agreement also contains customary events of default. 
 NOTE PURCHASE AGREEMENT 
 On August 23, 2013, we entered into a Note Purchase Agreement with certain institutional investors (the Purchasers ). On August 27, 2013, the Purchasers purchased an aggregate principal amount of million of our Senior Notes Series A, Senior Notes Series B, and Senior Notes Series C (collectively, the Notes ). Interest on the Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears. The fair value of the Notes approximated million on September 30, 2024. We estimate the fair value of the Notes primarily using an expected present value technique, which is based on observable market inputs using interest rates currently available to companies of similar credit standing for similar terms and remaining maturities and considering our own risk. If the Notes were recorded at fair value, they would be classified as a Level 2 financial liability. Senior Notes Series A matured in August 2023. 
 The Note Purchase Agreement contains various restrictions and covenants that require us to maintain certain financial ratios, including a maximum leverage ratio of to 1.00, a minimum interest coverage ratio of to 1.00, and a maximum consolidated priority debt to consolidated total asset ratio of percent. 
 The Note Purchase Agreement provides for customary events of default. The occurrence of an event of default would permit certain Purchasers to declare certain Notes then outstanding to be immediately due and payable. Under the terms of the Note Purchase Agreement, the Notes are redeemable, in whole or in part, at percent of the principal amount being redeemed together with a make-whole amount (as defined in the Note Purchase Agreement), and accrued and unpaid interest with respect to each Note. The obligations of the company under the Note Purchase Agreement and the Notes are guaranteed by C.H. Robinson Company, a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of the company, and by C.H. Robinson Company, Inc., a Minnesota corporation and an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the company. On November 21, 2022, we executed a third amendment to the Note Purchase Agreement to, among other things, facilitate the terms of the Credit Agreement.

 million as of September 30, 2024. The interest rate on borrowings under the Receivables Securitization Facility is based on SOFR plus a credit spread adjustment of percent plus percent. In addition, there is a commitment fee on the average daily undrawn stated amount under the facility of percent. 
 The recorded amount of borrowings outstanding under the Receivables Securitization Facility approximates fair value because it can be redeemed on short notice and the interest rate floats. We consider these borrowings to be a Level 2 financial liability. 
 The Receivables Securitization Facility contains various customary affirmative and negative covenants, and it also contains customary default and termination provisions, which provide for acceleration of amounts owed under the Receivables Securitization Facility upon the occurrence of certain specified events. 
 On November 7, 2023, we amended the Receivables Securitization Facility to extend the termination date of the facility to November 7, 2025. The total available remains million, and we have the option to utilize an accordion feature, if needed, of an additional million pursuant to the provisions of the Receivables Purchase Agreement, amended by the Receivables Purchase Amendment. 
 SENIOR NOTES 
 On April 9, 2018, we issued senior unsecured notes Senior Notes through a public offering. The Senior Notes bear an annual interest rate of percent payable semi-annually on April 15 and October 15, until maturity on April 15, 2028. Taking into effect the amortization of the original issue discount and all underwriting and issuance expenses, the Senior Notes have an effective yield to maturity of approximately percent per annum. The fair value of the Senior Notes, excluding debt discounts and issuance costs, approximated million as of September 30, 2024, based primarily on the market prices quoted from external sources. The carrying value of the Senior Notes was million as of September 30, 2024. 
 We may redeem the Senior Notes, in whole or in part, at any time and from time to time prior to their maturity at the applicable redemption prices described in the Senior Notes. Upon the occurrence of a change of control triggering event as defined in the Senior Notes (generally, a change of control of us accompanied by a reduction in the credit rating for the Senior Notes), we will generally be required to make an offer to repurchase the Senior Notes from holders at percent of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of repurchase. 
 The Senior Notes were issued under an indenture that contains covenants imposing certain limitations on our ability to incur liens or enter into sale and leaseback transactions above certain limits; and consolidate, or merge or transfer substantially all of our assets and those of our subsidiaries on a consolidated basis. It also provides for customary events of default (subject in certain cases to customary grace and cure periods), which include, among other things nonpayment, breach of covenants in the indenture, and certain events of bankruptcy and insolvency. If an event of default occurs and is continuing with respect to the Senior Notes, the trustee or holders of at least percent in principal amount outstanding of the Senior Notes may declare the principal and the accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on all of the outstanding Senior Notes to be due and payable. These covenants and events of default are subject to a number of important qualifications, limitations, and exceptions that are described in the indenture. The indenture does not contain any financial ratios or specified levels of net worth or liquidity to which we must adhere. 
 million discretionary line of credit with U.S. Bank of which million is utilized for standby letters of credit related to insurance collateral as of September 30, 2024. These standby letters of credit are renewed annually and were undrawn as of September 30, 2024.

 In 2021, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development OECD announced an Inclusive Framework on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting including Pillar Two Model Rules defining the global minimum tax, which calls for the taxation of large multinational corporations at a minimum rate of 15 percent. Subsequently, multiple sets of administrative guidance have been issued. Many non-U.S. tax jurisdictions have either recently enacted legislation to adopt certain components of the Pillar Two Model Rules beginning in 2024 (including the European Union Member States) with the adoption of additional components in later years or announced their plans to enact legislation in future years. We are continuing to evaluate the impact of enacted legislation and pending legislation to enact Pillar Two Model Rules in the tax jurisdictions we operate in. 
 During the third quarter of 2024, we recognized an increase to tax expense of approximately million for non-deductible expenses related to the planned divestiture of our Europe Surface Transportation business. Refer to Note 14, Divestitures for additional detail related to the divestiture of our Europe Surface Transportation business. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we have million of unrecognized tax benefits and related interest and penalties. It is possible the amount of unrecognized tax benefit could change in the next 12 months as a result of a lapse of the statute of limitations, new information, or settlements with taxing authorities. The total liability for unrecognized tax benefits is expected to decrease by approximately million in the next 12 months due to the lapsing of statutes of limitations. With few exceptions, we are no longer subject to audits of U.S. federal, state and local, or non-U.S. income tax returns before 2019. 
 
 NOTE 6. 
 Stock awards Company expense on ESPP discount Total stock-based compensation expense 
 On May 5, 2022, our shareholders approved a 2022 Equity Incentive Plan (the Plan and authorized an initial shares for issuance of awards thereunder. The Plan allows us to grant certain stock awards, including stock options at fair market value, performance-based restricted stock units PSUs and shares, and time-based restricted stock units, to our key 
 13 

Table of Contents 

 shares available for stock awards under the Plan as of September 30, 2024. 
 Stock Options We have awarded stock options to certain key employees that vest primarily based on their continued employment. The fair value of these options was established based on the market price on the date of grant calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. Changes in measured stock price volatility and interest rates were the primary reasons for changes in the fair value. These grants are being expensed based on the terms of the awards. As of September 30, 2024, unrecognized compensation expense related to stock options was million. 
 Stock Awards We have awarded performance-based restricted shares, PSUs, and time-based restricted stock units. Many of our awards contain restrictions on the awardees ability to sell or transfer vested awards for a specified period of time. The fair value of these awards is established based on the market price on the date of grant, discounted for any post-vesting holding restrictions. The discounts on outstanding grants with post-vesting holding restrictions vary from percent to percent and are calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model-protective put method. The duration of the restriction period to sell or transfer vested awards, changes in the measured stock price volatility and changes in interest rates are the primary reasons for changes in the discount. These grants are being expensed based on the terms of the awards. 
 Performance-based Awards 
 Beginning in 2021, we have awarded PSUs on an annual basis to certain key employees. These PSUs vest over a period based on the achievement of certain dilutive earnings per share, adjusted gross profits, and adjusted operating margin targets. These PSUs contain an upside opportunity of up to percent of target contingent upon obtaining certain targets mentioned above over their respective performance period. 
 Time-based Awards 
 We award time-based restricted stock units to certain key employees. Time-based awards granted through 2020 vest over a period. Beginning in 2021, we have granted time-based awards on an annual basis which vest over a period. These awards vest primarily based on the passage of time and the employee s continued employment. 
 We granted PSUs at target and time-based restricted stock units in February 2024 that vest over a period. The PSUs will vest upon achieving cumulative dilutive earnings per share targets and contain an upside opportunity of up to percent. The PSUs and time-based restricted stock unit awards had a weighted average grant date fair value of and provide for of post-termination vesting upon a qualified retirement. 
 We have also awarded restricted stock units to certain key employees and non-employee directors which are fully vested upon date of grant. These units contain restrictions on the awardees ability to sell or transfer vested units for a specified period of time. The fair value of these units is established using the same method discussed above. These awards have been expensed on the date of grant. 
 As of September 30, 2024, there was unrecognized compensation expense of million related to previously granted stock awards assuming maximum achievement is obtained on our PSUs. The amount of future expense to be recognized will be based on the passage of time and contingent upon obtaining certain targets mentioned above over their respective performance period. 
 Employee Stock Purchase Plan Our 1997 Employee Stock Purchase Plan ESPP allows our employees to contribute up to of their annual cash compensation to purchase company stock. The purchase price is determined using the closing price on the last day of each quarter discounted by percent. Shares vest immediately.

 OVERVIEW 
 C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc. C.H. Robinson, the company, we, us, or our is one of the original logistics leaders. Companies around the world look to us to reimagine supply chains, advance freight technology, and solve logistics challenges from the simple to the most complex. Through our unmatched expertise, unrivaled scale, and tailored solutions, we ensure the seamless delivery of goods across industries and continents via truckload, less-than-truckload, ocean, air, and beyond. As a responsible global citizen, we make supply chains more sustainable and proudly contribute millions to the causes that matter most to our employees. 
 Our adjusted gross profits and adjusted gross profit margin are non-GAAP financial measures. Adjusted gross profits are calculated as gross profits excluding amortization of internally developed software utilized to directly serve our customers and contracted carriers. Adjusted gross profit margin is calculated as adjusted gross profits divided by total revenues. We believe adjusted gross profits and adjusted gross profit margin are useful measures of our ability to source, add value, and sell services and products that are provided by third parties, and we consider adjusted gross profits to be a primary performance measurement. Accordingly, the discussion of our results of operations often focuses on the changes in our adjusted gross profits and adjusted gross profit margin.

 MARKET TRENDS 
 Carrier capacity in the North America surface transportation market continues to exceed shipper demand, resulting in suppressed transportation rates near the estimated cost to operate a truck. These conditions, which have prevailed for over a year, are commonly referred to as a soft market. One of the key metrics we use to measure market conditions is the truckload routing guide depth from our Managed Services business. This metric measures the average number of carriers contacted before securing a transportation provider. In the recent soft market, routing guides have operated efficiently, as carriers are less likely to reject freight tenders. Due to the soft market conditions, the average routing guide depth has remained consistently low at 1.2 throughout 2023 and 2024. This indicates that the first carrier in a shipper s routing guide typically accepts the shipment, thereby limiting the number of shipments reaching the spot market. Despite potential impacts from seasonality, severe weather events, or port labor issues creating short-term regional pressure on available carrier capacity, these soft market conditions are expected to persist until carrier capacity better aligns with shipper demand. 
 26 

Table of Contents 

 The global forwarding market remains volatile, impacted by re-routing and extended transit times. Most carriers continue to avoid the Suez Canal due to the Red Sea conflict, which has increased transit times and is straining global carrier capacity. Despite being brief, recent port worker strikes on the U.S. East Coast compounded the challenges, causing re-routings, equipment shortages, and worsening port congestion. These conditions, combined with the traditional peak season volumes and severe weather events, are more than offsetting the impact of new capacity which continues to enter the market. Consequently, ocean freight rates have remained elevated compared to the prior year. These ongoing global disruptions, coupled with macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty, are likely to continue affecting ocean freight pricing in the near term, although the extent remains uncertain. Despite the challenges facing the ocean freight market, the global air freight market has largely stabilized, although air freight costs remain elevated compared to the prior year. The elevated e-commerce export demand from Asia continues to result in the repositioning of air freight capacity to that trade lane, causing freighter capacity shortages in other trade lanes. 
 BUSINESS TRENDS 
 Our third quarter of 2024 surface transportation results continued to be impacted by the prevailing soft market conditions discussed in the market trends section. These conditions led to most shipments moving under committed pricing agreements and suppressed freight rates for the limited number of shipments reaching the spot market and negatively impacted our surface transportation total revenues. Despite these challenging market conditions, we were able to improve our adjusted gross profits per transaction in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 as a result of disciplined pricing and capacity procurement efforts leading to better adjusted gross profits per transaction within our transactional portfolio. Industry freight volumes, as measured by the Cass Freight Index, decreased in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the same period of 2023. Despite these challenging market conditions, our combined North American Surface Transportation NAST truckload and less than truckload LTL volumes increased modestly during the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023. Our average truckload linehaul cost per mile, excluding fuel surcharges, decreased approximately 0.5 percent during the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023. Our average truckload linehaul rate charged to our customers, excluding fuel surcharges, increased approximately 2.5 percent during the third quarter of 2024. 
 Our third quarter of 2024 global forwarding results continue to be impacted by the volatile market conditions discussed in the market trends section. We experienced significantly elevated purchased transportation costs for ocean freight in the third quarter of 2024, which resulted in significant increases to both ocean total revenues and the cost of purchased transportation compared to the third quarter of 2023. The global forwarding market in the third quarter of 2023 was experiencing weak demand and elevated levels of capacity which has added to the significant year over year change when compared to the more volatile market conditions for much of 2024. Our ocean freight volumes increased 7.0 percent while our air freight tonnage increased 20.0 percent compared to the third quarter of 2023 driven by the strong execution of our global forwarding team and the improved freight demand relative to the prior year. 
 SELECTED OPERATING PERFORMANCE AND OTHER SIGNIFICANT ITEMS 
 The following summarizes select third quarter 2024 year-over-year operating comparisons to the third quarter 2023: 
 Total revenues increased 7.0 percent to 4.6 billion, primarily driven by higher pricing and volume in our ocean services, partially offset by lower pricing and volume in our truckload services. 
 Gross profits increased 15.5 percent to 723.8 million. Adjusted gross profits increased 15.8 percent to 735.3 million, primarily driven by higher adjusted gross profit per transaction in our ocean and truckload services. 
 Personnel expenses increased 5.2 percent to 361.6 million, primarily due to higher variable compensation, partially offset by cost optimization efforts and lower average employee headcount, which decreased 9.6 percent. 
 Other selling, general, and administrative SG A expenses increased 8.9 percent to 193.6 million primarily due to the 57.0 million loss on the planned divestiture of our Europe Surface Transportation business that was partially offset by cost reductions across several expense categories. The prior year also included 21.4 million of expenses primarily related to the divestiture of our Argentina operations. 
 Income from operations increased 58.7 percent to 180.1 million, due to the increase in adjusted gross profit, partially offset by the increase in operating expenses. 
 Adjusted operating margin of 24.5 percent increased 660 basis points. 
 Interest and other income/expense, net totaled 36.3 million of expense, consisting primarily of 22.1 million of interest expense, which increased 0.2 million compared to last year, and a 15.1 million net loss from foreign currency revaluation and realized foreign currency gains and losses. 
 The effective tax rate in the quarter was 32.4 percent compared to 11.7 percent in the third quarter last year.

 Net income totaled 97.2 million, an increase of 18.6 percent from a year ago. 
 Diluted earnings per share (EPS) increased 17.6 percent to 0.80. 
 Cash flow from operations decreased 443.5 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily driven by an increase in net operating working capital.

 Consolidated Results of Operations Three Months Ended September 30, 2024, Compared to the Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 Total revenues and direct costs. Total transportation revenues and direct costs increased primarily due to increased pricing and purchased transportation costs in ocean services. This increase was partially offset by lower pricing and purchased transportation costs in truckload services compared to the prior year. The global forwarding market continued to face disruptions from re-routing and longer transit times caused by the Red Sea conflict, along with increasing challenges in the third quarter of 2024, including port worker uncertainty on the U.S. East Coast, equipment shortages and worsening port congestion in certain regions. These challenges, coupled with rising demand compared to the weak global demand of the prior year, have driven up ocean freight rates in the third quarter of 2024. Conversely, the lower pricing and purchased transportation costs in truckload services are attributed to the ongoing soft market conditions, characterized by an oversupply of carrier capacity as

Table of Contents 

 discussed in the market and business trends section above. Our sourcing total revenue and direct costs increased, driven by higher average pricing with retail customers and increased case volume with foodservice customers. 
 Gross profits and adjusted gross profits. Our transportation adjusted gross profits increased, driven by higher adjusted gross profits per transaction in ocean and truckload services, as well as an increase in ocean freight volumes. The higher adjusted gross profits per transaction in ocean services were driven by the challenges facing the global forwarding market, which resulted in elevated pricing. In truckload services, the increase was driven by the improved execution and disciplined pricing and capacity procurement efforts from our team within our transactional portfolio during the third quarter of 2024 compared to the prior year. Sourcing adjusted gross profits increased, driven by an increase in integrated supply chain solutions for retail and foodservice customers. 
 Operating expenses. Personnel expenses increased primarily due to variable compensation reflecting the improved results compared to the prior year. This increase was partially offset by cost optimization efforts, including lower average employee headcount. Other SG A expenses increased due to the planned divestiture of our Europe Surface Transportation business and was partially offset by the impact of the divestiture of our Argentina operations in the prior year discussed below. 
 In addition to the above, our personnel expenses for the third quarter of 2024 included 2.8 million of severance and related personnel expenses. We also incurred 1.6 million of restructuring related other SG A expenses in the third quarter of 2024. These expenses were both associated with our 2024 Restructuring Program. Our other SG A expenses in the third quarter of 2024 included a 57.0 million loss related to the planned divestiture of our Europe Surface Transportation business. 
 Our personnel expenses for the third quarter of 2023 included 3.0 million of severance and related personnel expenses associated with our 2022 Restructuring Program and the divestiture of our Argentina operations. Other SG A expenses in the third quarter of 2023 included 21.4 million related to disposal and exit activities, including asset impairments. These expenses were associated with the divestiture of our Argentina operations and our 2022 Restructuring Program. Refer to Note 13, Restructuring , for further discussion related to our 2024 and 2022 Restructuring Programs. Refer to Note 14, Divestitures , for further discussion related to the divestiture of our Europe Surface Transportation business and Argentina operations. 
 Interest and other income/expense, net. Interest and other income/expense, net primarily consisted of interest expense of 22.1 million. Interest expense increased 0.2 million during the third quarter of 2024, due to higher interest rates. The current year included a 15.1 million net loss from foreign currency revaluation and realized foreign currency gains and losses, compared to a 0.1 million net gain in the prior year. The 0.1 million net gain in the prior year was the result of a 5.1 million loss related to the devaluation of the Argentine Peso that was more than offset by gains related to other foreign currencies. 
 Provision for income taxes. Our effective income tax rate was 32.4 percent for the third quarter of 2024 compared to 11.7 percent for the third quarter of 2023. The effective income tax rate for the third quarter of 2024 was higher than the statutory federal income tax rate primarily due to the tax impact of foreign tax credits and business divestitures, which increased the effective tax rate by 13.7 percentage points and 7.9 percentage points, respectively. These impacts were partially offset by U.S. tax credits and incentives and a lower tax rate on foreign earnings which decreased the effective income tax rate by 5.1 percentage points and 4.5 percentage points, respectively, during the third quarter of 2024. The effective income tax rate for the third quarter of 2023 was lower than the statutory federal income tax rate primarily due to the tax impact of foreign tax credits, U.S. tax credits and incentives, and business divestitures, which reduced the effective tax rate by 9.0 percentage points, 6.1 percentage points, and 5.9 percentage points, respectively. These impacts were partially offset by a higher tax rate on foreign earnings, which increased the effective income tax rate by 8.4 percentage points during the third quarter of 2023. 
 
 Consolidated Results of Operations Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024, Compared to the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 Total revenues and direct costs. Total revenues and direct costs were essentially flat with the prior year with significant offsetting impacts from ocean and truckload services. Ocean transportation revenues and direct costs increased driven by the ongoing volatile market conditions, as discussed in the market trends section above, which significantly impacted carrier capacity and led to increased ocean freight rates in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Conversely, truckload transportation revenues and direct costs decreased compared to the prior year. This decline in truckload pricing and purchased transportation costs was driven by the ongoing soft market conditions in surface transportation, characterized by an oversupply of carrier capacity during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Our sourcing total revenue and direct costs increased driven by higher average pricing with retail customers and increased case volume with foodservice customers.

 Gross profits and adjusted gross profits. Our transportation adjusted gross profits increased, driven by higher adjusted gross profits per transaction in our ocean and truckload services, as well as an increase in ocean freight volumes. The higher adjusted gross profits per transaction in ocean services were driven by the challenges facing the global forwarding market, which resulted in elevated pricing. In truckload services, the increase was driven by the improved execution and disciplined pricing and capacity procurement efforts from our team within our transactional portfolio during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Sourcing adjusted gross profits increased due to an increase in integrated supply chain solutions for retail and foodservice customers. 
 Operating expenses. Personnel expenses decreased primarily due to cost optimization efforts including lower average employee headcount, partially offset by higher variable compensation reflecting the improved results compared to the prior year. Other SG A expenses increased primarily due to the planned divestiture of our Europe Surface Transportation business and was partially offset by the impact of the divestiture of our Argentina operations in the prior year discussed below and cost reductions across several expense categories in the current year. 
 In addition to the above, our personnel expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, included 20.2 million of severance and related personnel expenses. We also incurred 69.4 million of other SG A expenses in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. These expenses were associated with our 2024 Restructuring Program and a 57.0 million loss on the planned divestiture of our Europe Surface Transportation business. 
 Our personnel expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, included 19.7 million of severance and related personnel expenses. Other SG A expenses in the nine months ended September 30, 2023, were 22.6 million related to disposal and exit activities, including asset impairments. These expenses were associated with our 2022 Restructuring Program and a 21.3 million loss on the divestiture of our Argentina operations. Refer to Note 13, Restructuring , for further discussion related to our 2024 and 2022 Restructuring Programs. Refer to Note 14, Divestitures , for further discussion related to the divestiture of our Europe Surface Transportation business and Argentina operations. 
 Interest and other income/expense, net. Interest and other income/expense, net primarily consisted of interest expense of 67.1 million, which decreased 1.5 million driven by lower average debt balances compared to the prior year. The nine months ended September 30, 2024, included a net 10.7 million unfavorable impact from foreign currency revaluation and realized foreign currency gains and losses. The prior year included a net 5.9 million unfavorable impact from foreign currency revaluation and realized foreign currency gains and losses primarily driven by an 8.9 million foreign currency loss related to our operations in Argentina that were divested in the prior year. 
 Provision for income taxes. Our effective income tax rate was 23.0 percent for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 13.5 percent for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The effective income tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was higher than the statutory federal income tax rate primarily due to the tax impact of foreign tax credits, the tax impact of business divestitures, and state income tax expense, net of federal benefit, which increased the effective tax rate by 3.8 percentage points, 2.8 percentage points, and 2.7 percentage points, respectively. These impacts were partially offset by the tax impact of U.S. tax credits and incentives, which decreased the effective income tax rate by 5.8 percentage points. The effective income tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was lower than the statutory federal income tax rate due to the tax impact of foreign tax credits, U.S. tax credits and incentives, and the tax impact of share-based payment awards, which reduced the effective tax rate by 4.8 percentage points, 4.5 percentage points, and 2.9 percentage points, respectively. These impacts were partially offset by state income tax expense, net of federal benefit, and a lower tax rate on foreign earnings, which increased the effective income tax rate by 2.4 percentage points and 2.1 percentage points, respectively.

 Total revenues and direct costs. NAST total revenues and direct costs decreased primarily due to lower pricing and purchased transportation costs and a decline in volume in truckload services. The lower pricing and purchased transportation costs in truckload services continue to be driven by the ongoing soft market conditions as the market remains in a prolonged stage of oversupplied carrier capacity as discussed in the market and business trends section above. Partially offsetting these declines were increased volumes and higher pricing and purchased transportation costs in LTL services. 
 Gross profits and adjusted gross profits. NAST adjusted gross profits increased due to higher adjusted gross profits per transaction in truckload services and an increase in volume in LTL services. The improvement in truckload services was driven by improved execution and disciplined pricing and capacity procurement within our transactional portfolio. Our average truckload linehaul rate per mile charged to our customers, which excludes fuel surcharges, increased approximately 2.5 percent in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023. Our truckload linehaul cost per mile, excluding fuel surcharges, decreased approximately 0.5 percent in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023. NAST other adjusted gross profits decreased, primarily due to a decline in warehousing and intermodal adjusted gross profits. 
 Operating expenses. NAST personnel expenses increased driven by an increase in variable compensation reflecting the improved results compared to the prior year. This increase was partially offset by cost optimization efforts, including lower average employee headcount. NAST other SG A expenses decreased across several categories driven by cost optimization efforts in addition to lower credit losses. 
 In addition to the above, NAST personnel expenses in the third quarter of 2024 included 1.2 million of severance and related personnel expenses. We also incurred 0.6 million of restructuring related other SG A expenses in the third quarter of 2024. These expenses were both associated with our 2024 Restructuring Program. Refer to Note 13, Restructuring , for further discussion related to our 2024 Restructuring Program.

 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024, Compared to the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 Total revenues and direct costs. NAST total revenues and direct costs decreased driven by lower pricing and purchased transportation costs and a decline in volume in truckload services. The lower pricing and purchased transportation costs in truckload services continue to be driven by the ongoing soft market conditions as the market remains in a prolonged stage of oversupplied carrier capacity during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Partially offsetting these declines were increased volumes and higher pricing and purchased transportation costs in LTL services. 
 Gross profits and adjusted gross profits. NAST adjusted gross profits increased driven by truckload services due to higher adjusted gross profits per transaction despite a decline in truckload service volumes. This improvement was driven by improved execution and disciplined pricing and capacity procurement within our transactional portfolio in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Our average truckload linehaul rate per mile charged to our customers, which excludes fuel surcharges, decreased approximately 2.5 percent. Our truckload linehaul cost per mile, excluding fuel surcharges, decreased approximately 4.0 percent. Additionally, adjusted gross profits per transaction and volumes also increased in LTL services. NAST other adjusted gross profits decreased, primarily due to a decline in warehousing and intermodal adjusted gross profits. 
 Operating expenses. NAST personnel expense increased driven by an increase in variable compensation reflecting the improved results compared to the prior year. This increase was partially offset by cost optimization efforts, including lower average employee headcount. NAST other SG A expenses decreased primarily due to cost optimization efforts resulting in lower allocated corporate expenses. 
 In addition to the above, NAST personnel expenses in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, included 9.0 million of severance and related personnel expenses. We also incurred 6.2 million of restructuring related other SG A expenses in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. These expenses were both associated with our 2024 Restructuring Program.

 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024, Compared to the Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 Total revenues and direct costs. Global Forwarding total revenues and direct costs increased driven by higher pricing and purchased transportation costs and increased volume in ocean services, and to a lesser extent in air freight, compared to the prior year. In the third quarter of 2023, the global forwarding market faced weak demand and elevated capacity levels. However, market conditions have become more volatile in the third quarter of 2024. This volatility has been driven by re-routing and extended transit times caused by the Red Sea conflict, along with increasing challenges related to port worker strikes, equipment shortages, and worsening port congestion. These issues, combined with traditional peak season volumes and severe weather events, have significantly elevated ocean and air freight rates and purchased transportation costs in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the suppressed levels of the prior year. 
 Gross profits and adjusted gross profits. Global Forwarding adjusted gross profits increased driven by higher adjusted gross profits per shipment in ocean services, and to a lesser extent in air freight, driven by the challenges facing the global forwarding market resulting in elevated pricing. Our ocean and air freight volumes also increased compared to the weak freight demand levels experienced in the prior year. Customs adjusted gross profits increased driven by both an increase in adjusted gross profits per transaction and an increase in transaction volumes. 
 Operating expenses. Personnel expenses increased primarily due to an increase in variable compensation reflecting the improved results relative to the prior year. This increase was partially offset by cost optimization efforts, including lower average employee headcount. Global Forwarding other SG A expenses decreased, as the prior year included a 21.0 million loss related to the divestiture of our Argentina operations. Additionally, other SG A expenses declined in the current year across several categories, including lower amortization expenses following the completion of amortization of intangible assets from a previous acquisition.

 In addition to the above, Global Forwarding personnel expenses for the third quarter of 2024 included 0.5 million of severance and related personnel expenses. We also incurred 0.9 million of restructuring related other SG A expenses in the third quarter of 2024. These expenses were both associated with our 2024 Restructuring Program. Personnel expenses for the third quarter of 2023 included 2.5 million of severance and related personnel expenses. Other SG A expenses in the third quarter of 2023 included 21.1 million related to disposal and exit activities, including asset impairments. These expenses were associated with our 2022 Restructuring Program and the divestiture of our Argentina operations.

 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024, Compared to the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 Total revenues and direct costs. Global Forwarding total revenues and direct costs increased, driven by higher pricing and purchased transportation costs in ocean services in addition to volume increases across all global forwarding transportation services. The higher pricing and purchased transportation costs in ocean services were driven by the ongoing volatile market conditions discussed in the market trends section above, which significantly impacted carrier capacity and led to increased ocean freight rates in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Additionally, disruptions in the ocean freight market have resulted in an increase in air freight tonnage, driven by ocean freight conversions in many trade lanes. These ocean freight conversions, coupled with heightened e-commerce demand out of North Asia and stronger peak season volumes compared to the prior year, have elevated air freight costs in certain trade lanes. The volatile market conditions in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, contrast with the weak demand, elevated capacity, and suppressed freight rates experienced in the same period in 2023. 
 Gross profits and adjusted gross profits. Global Forwarding adjusted gross profits increased, driven by higher adjusted gross profits per shipment driven by the challenges facing the global forwarding market, which resulted in elevated pricing and volume increases compared to the weak demand experienced in the prior year. Air freight adjusted gross profits were essentially flat, as lower adjusted gross profits per metric ton shipped were mostly offset by an increase in metric tons shipped. The decrease in adjusted gross profits per metric ton shipped was driven by sharp increases to the cost of air freight in certain trade lanes compared to the prior year. Customs adjusted gross profits increased, driven by higher transaction volumes and an increase in adjusted gross profits per transaction. 
 Operating expenses. Personnel expenses increased primarily due to increased variable compensation reflecting the improved results relative to the prior year. This increase was partially offset by cost optimization efforts, including lower average employee headcount. Other SG A expenses decreased, as the prior year included a 21.0 million loss related to the divestiture of our Argentina operations. Additionally, other SG A expenses declined in the current year related to lower allocated corporate expenses and lower amortization expenses following the completion of amortization of intangible assets from a prior acquisition. These decreases were partially offset by a higher provision for credit losses as the prior year benefited from a reduction to the allowance for credit losses. 
 In addition to the above, Global Forwarding personnel expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, included 5.9 million of severance and related personnel expenses. We also incurred 2.4 million of restructuring related other SG A expenses in 2024. These expenses were both associated with our 2024 Restructuring Program. Personnel expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, included 4.7 million of severance and related personnel expenses. Other SG A expenses in the nine months ended September 30, 2023, included 21.2 million related to disposal and exit activities, including asset impairments. These expenses were associated with our 2022 Restructuring Program and the divestiture of our Argentina operations.

 The following table summarizes our major sources and uses of cash and cash equivalents (dollars in thousands): Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 change Sources (uses) of cash: Cash provided by operating activities 241,154 684,615 (64.8) Capital expenditures (59,099) (67,975) Sale of property and equipment 1,324 Cash used for investing activities (59,099) (66,651) (11.3) Repurchase of common stock (63,884) Cash dividends (220,256) (218,942) Net payments on debt (20,000) (391,000) Other financing activities 56,012 22,307 Cash used for financing activities (184,244) (651,519) (71.7) Effect of exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents (653) (6,708) Net change in cash and cash equivalents, including cash and cash equivalents classified within assets held for sale (2,842) (40,263) 
 Cash flow from operating activities. Our operating cash flows benefited in the prior year from declining freight rates in ocean and truckload services, which resulted in a decrease in net operating working capital and drove strong operating cash flow. In the current year, freight rates in ocean services have increased resulting in an increase in net operating working capital driving a decline in operating cash flows in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. We continue to closely monitor credit and collections activities and the quality of our accounts receivable balance to minimize risk as well as work with our customers to facilitate the movement of goods across their supply chains while also ensuring timely payment. 
 Cash used for investing activities. Capital expenditures consisted primarily of investments in software, which are intended to develop and deliver scalable solutions by transforming our processes, accelerate the pace of development and prioritizing data integrity, improve our customer and carrier experience, and increase efficiency to help expand our adjusted operating margins and grow the business. 
 Cash used for financing activities. Net repayments on debt in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and the nine months ended September 30, 2023, were primarily to reduce the outstanding balance on the Receivables Securitization Facility and our revolving credit facility. No shares were repurchased in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The number of shares we repurchase, if any, during future periods will vary based on our cash position, other potential uses of our cash, and market conditions. Over the long term, we remain committed to our quarterly dividend and share repurchases to enhance shareholder value. Such repurchases, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions, and other factors. We may seek to retire or purchase our outstanding Senior Notes through open market cash purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. 
 We believe that, assuming no change in our current business plan, our available cash, together with expected future cash generated from operations, the amount available under our credit facilities, and credit available in the market, will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated needs for working capital, capital expenditures, and cash dividends for at least the next 12 months and the foreseeable future. We also believe we could obtain funds under lines of credit or other forms of indebtedness on short notice, if needed. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with all of the covenants under our debt agreements.

 Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of September 30, 2024. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of September 30, 2024. 
 (b) Changes in internal control over financial reporting. 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) that occurred during the three months ended September 30, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 PART II-OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
 We are not subject to any pending or threatened litigation other than routine litigation arising in the ordinary course of our business operations, including certain contingent auto liability cases. For some legal proceedings, we have accrued an amount that reflects the aggregate liability deemed probable and estimable, but this amount is not material to our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. Because of the preliminary nature of many of these proceedings, the difficulty in ascertaining the applicable facts relating to many of these proceedings, the inconsistent treatment of claims made in many of these proceedings, and the difficulty of predicting the settlement value of many of these proceedings, we are often unable to estimate an amount or range of any reasonably possible additional losses. However, based upon our historical experience, the resolution of these proceedings is not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. 
 
 ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 
 In addition to the other information set forth in this Quarterly Report, you should carefully consider the factors disclosed in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, which could materially affect our business, financial condition, or future results. There have not been material changes in our risk factors set forth in the company s 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. The risks described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K are not the only risks facing our company. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and/or operating results.
