PART I - FINANCIAL INFORMATION 
 
 ITEM 1 . FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 
 Explanatory Note 
 
 From its formation on April 2, 2024 until the consummation of the Business Combination on August 15, 2024, New Silexion had no operations and had been formed for the sole purpose of entering into the Business Combination and serving as the publicly-traded registrant resulting from the Business Combination. Consequently, for all periods prior to, and through, August 15, 2024, the financial condition and results of operations presented herein are those of Silexion, as the accounting acquirer in the Business Combination and the predecessor entity to the Company from an accounting perspective. Consequently, our financial statements included in this Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report as of, and for the three and nine-month periods ended on, September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively, reflect: 
 
 (i)

 the information of New Silexion (as the combined company following the Business Combination) as of September 30, 2024, as compared to

(ii) 
 as to each of the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations, unaudited condensed consolidated statements of changes in redeemable convertible preferred shares and capital deficiency, and unaudited condensed consolidated statements of cash flows: 
 
 a. 
 for the periods from January 1, 2024 (for the nine-month results) or July 1, 2024 (for the three-month results) through August 15, 2024 (the date of the Business Combination), the results of Silexion (which was the accounting acquirer in the Business Combination and the predecessor entity to New Silexion), and, for the remaining period from August 16, 2024 through September 30, 2024, the results of the combined company, as compared to 
 
 b. 
 for the three- and nine- month periods beginning on January 1, 2023 or July 1, 2023 and ended, in each case, on September 30, 2023, the results of Silexion (as the accounting acquirer in the Business Combination and the predecessor entity to New Silexion).

Moringa . Prior to the Transactions, Moringa s class A ordinary shares and warrants were listed for trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market (Nasdaq: MACA and MACAW). As part of the Transactions, Moringa merged with a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company and now serves as an inactive, wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. 

3. 

Silexion . Silexion was incorporated in Israel and began its operations on November 30, 2008. Since its incorporation, Silexion has been engaged in operating segment - the research and development of innovative treatments for pancreatic cancer based on siRNAs, aiming to stop the production of a specific pancreatic cancer-causing protein known as the KRAS mutation. Silexion s long-lived assets are located in Israel. 

4. 

The Company, the Subsidiary, Moringa and Silexion are together referred to hereinafter as the Group . 

d. 
 
 On April 3, 2024, Silexion entered into an Amended and Restated Business Combination Agreement (hereinafter, A R BCA with the SPAC, New Silexion, August M.S. Ltd. an Israeli company and wholly-owned subsidiary of New Silexion Merger Sub 1 ), and Moringa Acquisition Merger Sub Corp, a Cayman Islands exempted company and wholly-owned subsidiary of New Silexion Merger Sub 2 ). Under the A R BCA, both Silexion and the SPAC were toi become wholly-owned subsidiaries of New Silexion, which was to become a publicly-held, Nasdaq-listed entity (the A R BCA and related transactions: the Transactions ). 

On August 15, 2024, the parties completed the Transactions pursuant to which Merger Sub 2 merged with and into the SPAC, with the SPAC continuing as the surviving company of such merger and a wholly-owned subsidiary of New Silexion (the SPAC Merger ), and Merger Sub 1 merged with and into Silexion, with Silexion continuing as the surviving company of such merger and a wholly-owned subsidiary of New Silexion (the Acquisition Merger ). 

Upon the effectiveness of the SPAC Merger, each outstanding SPAC Class A ordinary share and the sole outstanding SPAC Class B ordinary share was converted into an ordinary share of New Silexion on a one-for-one basis. Each outstanding warrant to purchase one SPAC Class A ordinary share was converted into a warrant to purchase one New Silexion ordinary share, at the same exercise price. Upon the effectiveness of the Acquisition Merger, each outstanding ordinary share and each outstanding preferred share of Silexion was converted into shares of New Silexion (the Silexion Equity Exchange Ratio ). Each outstanding Silexion warrant and Silexion option to purchase one Silexion share, and Silexion restricted share unit (RSU) that may be potentially settled for one Silexion share, was to become exercisable for, or became subject to settlement for (as applicable), such number of New Silexion ordinary shares as were equal to the Silexion Equity Exchange Ratio. The exercise price per New Silexion ordinary share of each such converted Silexion option and Silexion warrant was to be adjusted based on dividing the existing per share exercise price by the Silexion Equity Exchange Ratio. The terms of vesting, exercise and/or settlement, as applicable, of such converted options, warrants and RSUs were to remain the same following such conversion, except that the vesting of each Silexion option was to accelerate immediately prior to the Acquisition Merger, such that the New Silexion option into which it was to be converted was to be fully vested, and all Silexion warrants were to be exercised (on a cashless basis) immediately prior to the Acquisition Merger. 

Immediately prior to the Closing seven directors were elected to New Silexion s board of directors, of whom five were designated by Silexion and two were designated by the SPAC s sponsor (the Sponsor ). 

The A R BCA also required, as a closing condition, the transfer of the remaining outstanding shares of the Subsidiary held by GIBF to Silexion prior to the closing of the Business Combination in exchange for the issuance to GIBF of shares of Silexion, which were to be converted into ordinary shares of New Silexion in accordance with the Silexion Equity Exchange Ratio upon the closing. 

e. 
 
 In connection with the closing of the Transactions, the ordinary shares and warrants of New Silexion are now listed on the Nasdaq Global Market and began trading under the symbols SLXN and SLXNW , respectively. 

f. 
 
 For more information on instruments issued as part of the Transactions, see Note 3. 

g. 

The Transactions were accounted for as a reverse recapitalization in accordance with US GAAP. Under this method of accounting, Silexion was treated as the accounting acquirer and the SPAC was treated as the acquired company for financial reporting purposes. Silexion was determined to be the accounting acquirer based on evaluation of the following facts and circumstances: 

Silexion s shareholders were to hold approximately of the outstanding voting interests in New Silexion upon the closing of the Transactions; 

 Silexion s senior management were to comprise the senior management of New Silexion; 

 the directors nominated by Silexion were to constitute a majority of the board of directors of New Silexion (five out of seven of the initial directors); 

 Silexion s operations were to comprise the ongoing operations of New Silexion; and 

 Silexion s name was to be the name used by New Silexion (in replacement of Biomotion Sciences). 

Under the reverse recapitalization accounting method, the Transactions were deemed to be the equivalent of a capital transaction in which Silexion issued shares for the net assets of the SPAC. The net assets of the SPAC were stated at fair value, with no goodwill or other intangible assets recorded. Operations prior to the Transactions are those of Silexion. 

In accordance with the applicable guidance to reverse recapitalization, the equity structure has been retroactively adjusted in all comparative periods up to the date of the Closing (the Closing Date ), to reflect the number of New Silexion s Ordinary Shares, par value per share issued to legacy Silexion shareholders in connection with the reverse recapitalization transaction. As such, the shares and corresponding capital amounts and earnings per share related to legacy Silexion shareholders prior to the reverse recapitalization have been retroactively restated as shares reflecting the exchange ratio established pursuant to the Transactions. In conjunction with the reverse recapitalization, Silexion s Ordinary Shares underwent a conversion.

 In October 2023, Hamas terrorists infiltrated Israel s southern border from the Gaza Strip and conducted a series of attacks on civilian and military targets. Following the attack, Israel s security cabinet declared war against Hamas and commenced a military campaign against Hamas and other terrorist organizations. 

In parallel, there have been continued hostilities along Israel s northern border, as the Hezbollah terrorist organization based in Lebanon has conducted rocket, drone, and, more recently, missile attacks against Israel. The hostilities with Hezbollah have escalated recently, prompting Israel to send its ground forces into southern Lebanon to destroy terrorist positions and infrastructure used by Hezbollah for attacks on northern and central Israel, which had caused the displacement of residents in northern Israel since early in the war. There have also been rocket, drone and missile attacks against Israel by the Houthi movement in Yemen and from Iran. 

The Company s headquarters are located in the central region of Israel. As of the issuance date of these consolidated financial statements, these conflicts have not had a material impact on the Company s results of operations or financial position, if at all. The Company cannot currently predict the intensity or duration of Israel s war, however, as most of the Company s trials are not executed in Israel, the Company does not believe the recent terrorist attack and the subsequent escalation will have any material impact on its ongoing operations. The Company continues to monitor its ongoing activities and will make any needed adjustments to ensure continuity of its business, while supporting the safety and well-being of its employees. 

Any hostilities involving Israel, or the interruption or curtailment of trade within Israel or between Israel and its trading partners could adversely affect the Company s operations and results of operations and could make it more difficult for the Company to raise capital. 

i. 
 
 Going concern: 

Since its inception, the Company (and, prior to the Transactions, its predecessor, Silexion) has devoted substantially all its efforts to research and development, clinical trials, and capital raising activities. The Company is still in its development and clinical stage and has not yet generated revenues. 

The Company (or, for those periods prior to the Transactions, its predecessor, Silexion) has incurred losses of and for the nine-months period ended on September 30, 2024 and for the year ended December 31, 2023, respectively. During the nine-month period ended on September 30, 2024, the Company (including Silexion, for periods prior to the Transactions) had negative operating cash flows of . As of September 30, 2024, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of . On August 15, 2024, Silexion completed a business combination with the SPAC. 

The Company expects to continue incurring losses, and negative cash flows from operations. Management is in the process of evaluating various financing alternatives, as the Company will need to finance future research and development activities, general and administrative expenses and working capital through fund raising. However, there is no assurance that the Company will be successful in obtaining such funding. 

Under these circumstances, in accordance with the requirements of ASC 205-40, management has concluded that there is substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern for at least 12 months from the date these financial statements are issued. The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that may be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern (see Note 1 (d)).

The Company is required to hold a minimum amount of NIS in its bank account in order to maintain availability of a credit line from its credit card company. 

or NIS per share. The Company considers these shares to be exercisable for little to no additional consideration. The Company also considers its redeemable convertible preferred shares to be participating securities as the holders of the redeemable convertible preferred shares would be entitled to dividends that would be distributed to the holders of ordinary shares, on a pro-rata basis assuming conversion of all redeemable convertible preferred shares into ordinary shares. However, these participating securities do not contractually require the holders to participate in the Company s losses. Consequently, net loss for the periods presented was not allocated to the Company s participating securities. 
 The Ordinary Shares issued as a result of the Redeemable Convertible Preferred Shares conversion on the Closing Date were included in the basic net loss per share calculation on a prospective basis. 

Under ASC 815-40, contracts that are not indexed to the Company s own stock are classified as liabilities recorded at fair value, As such, the Company classifies private warrants (see Note 3(e)) as liabilities and measures them at their fair value at each reporting period. This liability is subject to re-measurement at each balance sheet date until the private warrants are exercised or expire, or upon reassessment of classification. Similarly the Company classifies the ELOC Agreement entered into (see Note 3(d)) as a derivative instrument measured at fair value at each reporting period, as settlement provisions under this agreement are not indexed to the Company s own stock. 

The Company reassesses the classification of a contract over its own equity under the guidance above at each balance sheet date. If classification changes as a result of events during the reporting period, the Company reclassifies the contract as of the date of the event that caused the reclassification. When a contract over own equity is reclassified from a liability to equity, gains or losses recorded to account for the contract at fair value during the period that the contract was classified as a liability are not reversed, and the contract is marked to fair value immediately before the reclassification. The Redeemable Convertible Preferred Shares were converted into Ordinary Shares in the framework of the recapitalization transaction as described in note 1(d).

, in the aggregate, of the fee payable to EarlyBird under the Marketing Agreement entered into by Moringa with EarlyBird at the time of Moringa s initial public offering IPO ). At the Closing, Moringa paid of cash to EarlyBird from its Trust Account and New Silexion issued to EarlyBird a convertible promissory note, due December 31, 2025, in an amount of to be paid by New Silexion to EarlyBird in cash or via conversion of outstanding amounts into ordinary shares of New Silexion (the EarlyBird Convertible Note ). 

The EarlyBird Convertible Note bears interest at a rate of per annum and matures on December 31, 2025. If not repaid on or prior to that maturity date or such earlier date as to which the repayment obligation may be accelerated under the note, or not converted in accordance with the terms thereof, the rate of interest applicable to the unpaid principal amount would be adjusted to per annum. New Silexion is required to make mandatory prepayments on the note in amounts equal to of the gross proceeds received by New Silexion from any equity financings consummated by it prior to the maturity date. 

New Silexion is entitled to voluntarily prepay any additional part of, or all of, the principal and accrued interest, in one or more installments without penalty, prior to the maturity date. 

EarlyBird, in turn, may elect, at its sole discretion, at any time on or prior to the maturity date, to elect to convert all or part of the then outstanding principal and/or accrued interest under the EarlyBird Convertible Note into New Silexion ordinary shares, at a per share conversion price equal to of the volume weighted average price of a New Silexion ordinary share for the five trading days immediately prior to the date of New Silexion s receipt of a conversion notice. 

As of the date of this report, the Company repaid of the EarlyBird Convertible Note as a result of the share issuance under the ELOC Agreement; see Note 3(d). 

b. 
 
 Sponsor Promissory Note 

Effective as of the Closing, New Silexion issued to the Sponsor in replacement in their entirety of all previously existing promissory notes issued by Moringa to the Sponsor from its IPO until the Closing, an amended and restated promissory note (the A R Sponsor Promissory Note in an amount of . This reflected the total amount owed by Moringa to the Sponsor through the Closing Date. The maturity date of the A R Sponsor Promissory Note is the 30-month anniversary of the Closing Date (i.e., February 15, 2027). Amounts outstanding under the A R Sponsor Promissory Note may be repaid (unless otherwise decided by New Silexion) only by way of conversion into New Silexion ordinary shares Note Shares ). New Silexion and the Sponsor may also convert amounts outstanding under the A R Sponsor Promissory Note at the price per share at which New Silexion conducts an equity financing following the Closing, subject to a minimum conversion amount of , in an amount of Note Shares constituting up to thirty percent of the number of New Silexion ordinary shares issued and sold by New Silexion in such equity financing. The Sponsor may also elect to convert amounts of principal outstanding under the note into New Silexion ordinary shares at any time following the 24-month anniversary of the Closing Date, subject to a minimum conversion of , at a price per share equal to the volume weighted average price of the New Silexion ordinary shares on the principal market on which they are traded during the consecutive trading days prior to the conversion date. 

As of the date of this report, the Company has neither repaid, nor converted into New Silexion ordinary shares, any principal amounts outstanding under the Sponsor Promissory Note. 

c. 
 
 PIPE Financing 

In connection with, and immediately prior to the Closing of the Transactions, Moringa raised via a private investment in public entity financing (the PIPE Financing ), whereby Moringa sold to Greenstar, LP, an affiliate of the Moringa Sponsor (the PIPE Investor ), newly issued Moringa ordinary shares at a price of per share, pursuant to a subscription agreement, dated as of August 15, 2024, by and among Moringa, New Silexion and the PIPE Investor (the PIPE Agreement ). Those shares automatically converted upon the Closing of the Transactions into an equivalent number of New Silexion ordinary shares (the PIPE Shares ). 

d. 
 
 ELOC Financing 

In connection with the Closing, New Silexion entered into an ordinary share purchase agreement, effective as of the Closing Date (the ELOC Agreement ), for an equity line of credit (the ELOC with White Lion Capital, LLC (the ELOC Investor ), whereby New Silexion will be able to request to sell to the ELOC Investor, and the ELOC Investor will be required to purchase, via private placement transactions, up to of New Silexion ordinary shares from time to time after the Closing, up until December 31, 2025 (unless the agreement is terminated sooner), subject to certain limitations and conditions as described therein. The number of New Silexion ordinary shares that New Silexion may require the ELOC Investor to purchase in any single sales notice will depend on a number of factors, including the type of purchase notice that New Silexion delivers. Similarly, the purchase price to be paid by the ELOC Investor for any shares that New Silexion requires it to purchase will depend on the type of sales notice that New Silexion delivers. 

Purchase price is determined with reference to either the lowest daily volume-weighted average price of the Company s Ordinary Shares during a period of three consecutive business days ending on the notice date times or lowest traded price of the Company s Ordinary Shares on the notice date. 

Pursuant to the ELOC Agreement, New Silexion agreed, among other things, that if New Silexion s sales to the ELOC Investor under the ELOC exceed of New Silexion s total number of ordinary shares outstanding, New Silexion will seek the approval of its shareholders for the issuance of any New Silexion ordinary shares under the ELOC in excess of that amount, in accordance with the Nasdaq Listing Rules, subject to certain exceptions based on the price of the New Silexion ordinary shares to be sold in excess of that limit. 

In consideration for the commitments of the ELOC Investor, New Silexion agreed to issue to the ELOC Investor an aggregate of of New Silexion ordinary shares (the ELOC Commitment Shares ).

On the Closing Date, Moringa, New Silexion and Continental Stock Transfer Trust Company CST entered into a certain Assignment, Assumption and Amendment Agreement (the New Warrant Agreement ). The New Warrant Agreement amended Moringa s Warrant Agreement, dated as of February 19, 2021, to provide for the assignment by Moringa of all its rights, title and interest in the warrants of Moringa to New Silexion. 

Upon Closing, New Silexion assumed warrants sold by Moringa in its IPO Public Warrants and warrants sold by Moringa to the Sponsor and EarlyBird concurrently with its IPO (the Private Warrants , and together with the Public Warrants, the Warrants ). Each such Warrant entitles the holder thereof to purchase one Ordinary Share of New Silexion of per share, subject to adjustment. No fractional shares will be issued upon exercise of the Warrants. .

Silexion classified the warrants for the purchase of shares of its convertible redeemable preferred shares as a liability in its consolidated balance sheets, as these warrants were freestanding financial instruments which underlying shares were contingently redeemable and, therefore, may have obligated the Company to transfer assets at some point in the future. The warrant liability was initially recorded at fair value upon the date of issuance and was subsequently remeasured at fair value at each reporting date. The Company (or Silexion, as applicable) recorded revaluation expenses amounting to and for the nine months periods ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 , respectively, and revaluation (income) expenses amounting to ) and for the three months periods ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 and accounted for such revaluation expenses as part of its financial (income) expense, net, in the statements of operations (see Note 8).

ELOC agreement 

 As the ELOC agreement is in substance a purchased call option over the Company s own shares at a price mentioned in Note 3(d), the fair value of this agreement will generally be approximately zero, until the Company sells shares under the agreement. Once the Company sells share under the agreement, the difference between cash raised (net of transaction costs) and the closing price of the Ordinary Shares as of the date of their issuance is recognized as financing income or expenses . 

Fair value gain and losses arising from ELOC agreement are measured with reference to the spot price of the Company s shares sold less consideration receivable from the investor. 

Warrant to preferred shares 

The fair value of Silexion s warrant to purchase preferred shares as of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2023 was estimated using a hybrid model in order to reflect two scenarios: (1) an IPO event (including de-SPAC transaction) and (2) other liquidation events. For further details see Note 12 in the annual consolidated financial statements. 

The valuation under the other liquidation events scenario was assessed using an option pricing model (OPM) by implementing a Monte Carlo Simulation, which treats the financial instruments in Silexion s equity as contingent claims whose future payoff depends on Silexion s future equity value. Silexion s entire equity value in 2023 was calculated based, among others, on the financing round closest to the valuation date. 

Promissory Notes 

 In measuring the fair value of the Company s Promissory Notes, a discount rate of - was used, based on a B- rated US dollar zero-coupon discount curve, plus a credit spread of . The expected timing of conversion or redemption of the notes was determined using the Company s forecasts. 

Warrants over ordinary shares 

A Black-Scholes-Merton model are assumptions related to expected life (term), expected stock price, volatility, risk-free interest rate and dividend yield. The Company estimates the volatility of its warrants based on implied volatility from the Company s traded warrants and from historical volatility of selected peer companies Class A ordinary shares that matches the expected remaining life of the warrants. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury zero-coupon yield curve on the grant date for a maturity similar to the expected remaining life of the warrants. The expected life of the warrants is assumed to be equivalent to their remaining contractual term. The dividend rate is based on the historical rate, which the Company anticipates remaining at zero. 

The following table provides quantitative information regarding Level 3 fair value measurements inputs of the warrants:

As of September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, the basic loss per share calculation included a weighted average number of and , respectively, of fully vested pre-funded options. As the inclusion of other potential ordinary shares equivalents in the calculation would be anti-dilutive for all periods presented, diluted net loss per share is the same as basic net loss per share.

ITEM 2 . MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 
 The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with (i) our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly Report, (ii) Silexion s audited financial statements and related notes thereto as of, and for the year ended, December 31, 2023, which were included in the proxy statement/prospectus, and (iii) the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information of New Silexion as of June 30, 2024, and for the year ended December 31, 2023 and six months ended June 30, 2024, which was attached as Exhibit 99.2 to the Super Form 8-K. 
 
 Overview 
 
 We are a Cayman Islands exempted company that was originally formed for the purpose of effectuating the Business Combination and that now serves as a publicly-traded holding company for each of Silexion (through which our operations are carried out) and Moringa (which has no operations). Our ordinary shares and warrants are listed on the Nasdaq Global Market under the trading symbols SLXN and SLXNW , respectively. 
 
 We conduct operations primarily through our principal subsidiary Silexion which is a clinical-stage, oncology-focused biotechnology company engaged in the discovery and development of proprietary treatments for KRAS-driven cancers. The KRAS gene is an oncogene that is involved in the regulation of cell division as a result of its ability to relay external signals to the cell nucleus. Based on its research of refractory solid tumor cancers, Silexion is actively developing a platform focused on the silencing of the KRAS oncogene using RNA-interference therapeutics. Silexion s lead product candidate, SIL-204B, consists of locally administered small interfering RNAs, or siRNA, in an extended-release formulation, as a first-line treatment of locally advanced pancreatic cancer patients, in combination with standard-of-care chemotherapy. 
 
 To date, Silexion has financed its operations primarily with the net proceeds from private offerings of its ordinary shares and convertible preferred shares, grants from the Israeli Innovation Authority (the IIA ), convertible financing agreements and Simple Agreement for Future Equity (SAFE) financings, and royalty-bearing grants from the IIA (which totaled 5.8 million through September 30, 2024). Since its inception, Silexion has incurred significant operating losses. Silexion s net losses were 5.1 million and 3.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. The combined company s net losses (consisting of Silexion s net losses for all periods through the Business Combination, and the combined company's net losses for all periods after) were 14.8 million and 3.4 million for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of 41.6 million (reflecting Silexion's accumulated deficit for all periods through August 15, 2024 and the combined company's accumulated deficit from August 16, 2024 through September 30, 2024). Silexion has not recognized any revenue to date. 

In the near future, our operations conducted almost exclusively through Silexion will be funded from one or more of a number of alternative sources: 

the remaining balance of 333,936 of cash from the trust account transferred to us at the Closing of the Business Combination (from the proceeds of Moringa s initial public offering and the private placements of the Moringa private units, after reduction for payment of funds for (x) redemptions of Moringa public shares in connection with Moringa s shareholder votes on (A) the Business Combination and (B) the extension of the term of Moringa s existence at prior general meetings of Moringa, and (y) payment to EarlyBirdCapital of 350,000 of cash pursuant to the Marketing Agreement in connection with the Business Combination); 

2,000,000 of cash from the PIPE Financing (described below) involving the sale of 200,000 Moringa Class A ordinary shares to the PIPE Investor (as defined below) immediately prior to the Closing of the Business Combination (which shares converted into 200,000 ordinary shares upon the Closing); 

up to 15,000,000 from the ELOC (described below), from which we have raised 2.5 million as of the date of this Quarterly Report; 
 
 2 

additional grants from the IIA; 
 
 potential equity financings, including an offering of ordinary shares (or pre-funded warrants in lieu of ordinary shares), together with ordinary warrants, for which we have filed a registration statement on Form S-1 with the SEC on October 31, 2024; and 

existing working capital of Silexion. 
 
 We expect to continue to incur significant expenses and operating losses for the foreseeable future. The net losses that we incur may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter. Our expenses will depend on many factors, including the timing and extent of spending to further develop SIL-204 and initiate pre-clinical and clinical trials, support research and development efforts, investments in potential additional pipe-line products, and increased overall compensation as we continue to hire additional personnel. We anticipate that our expenses will increase if and as we: 

apply for Orphan Drug Designation in both the U.S. and EU for our SIL-204B product; 

initiate a clinical trial powered for statistical significance with respect to SIL-204B; 

initiate toxicological studies with respect to SIL-204B; 

seek marketing approvals for SIL-204B in various territories; 

maintain, expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio; 

hire additional operational, clinical, quality control and scientific personnel; 

add operational, financial and management information systems and personnel, including personnel to support our product development, any future commercialization efforts and our prospective transition to a public company; and 

invest in research and development and regulatory approval efforts in order to utilize our technology as a platform focused on the silencing of the KRAS oncogene using RNA-interference therapeutics.

Recent Developments Impacting Our Financial Condition and Outlook 
 
 ELOC Financing 
 
 In connection with the Closing of the Business Combination, we entered into an ordinary share purchase agreement, dated August 13, 2024, but effective as of the Closing (the ELOC Agreement ), for an equity line of credit (the ELOC with White Lion Capital, LLC (the ELOC Investor ). Under the ELOC, we have the right to request to sell to the ELOC Investor, and the ELOC Investor is required to purchase, via private placement transactions, up to 15.0 million of our ordinary shares from time to time after the Closing, up until December 31, 2025 (unless the agreement is terminated sooner), subject to certain limitations and conditions as described therein. The number of ordinary shares that we may require the ELOC Investor to purchase in any single sales notice depends on a number of factors, including the type of purchase notice that we deliver. Similarly, the purchase price to be paid by the ELOC Investor for any shares that we require it to purchase depends on the type of sales notice that we deliver, and is derived from the market price of the our ordinary shares for a certain period of time prior to our purchase request or as of the date of our purchase request. We also granted registration rights to the ELOC Investor pursuant to an accompanying registration rights agreement, also dated August 15, 2024, by and between New Silexion and the ELOC Investor (the ELOC Registration Rights Agreement ), for which we filed a registration statement on Form S-1 (SEC file number 333-282017), which was declared effective by the SEC on September 17, 2024. 
 
 Pursuant to the ELOC Agreement, New Silexion agreed, among other things, that if our sales to the ELOC Investor under the ELOC exceed 19.99 of our total number of ordinary shares outstanding, we will seek the approval of our shareholders for the issuance of any ordinary shares under the ELOC in excess of that amount, in accordance with the Nasdaq Listing Rules, subject to certain exceptions based on the price of our ordinary shares to be sold in excess of that limit. 
 
 In consideration for the commitments of the ELOC Investor, we agreed to issue to the ELOC Investor an aggregate of 337,500 of our ordinary shares (the ELOC Commitment Shares based on the closing price of the ordinary shares on the day that is the earlier of (i) the business day prior to effectiveness of the registration statement registering the resale of the shares issuable under the ELOC ordinary share purchase agreement and (ii) the business day prior to the 180 th day following the date of Closing of the Business Combination. 
 
 Through the date of this Quarterly Report, we have sold an aggregate of 4,294,000 ordinary shares to the ELOC Investor for net proceeds (after payment of commissions and expenses to the ELOC Investor) of 2.5 million, in the aggregate. 
 
 The foregoing summary is qualified in its entirety by the full text of the ELOC Agreement, a copy of which was attached as Exhibit 10.3.1 to the Super Form 8-K. 
 
 Settlement of Amounts Due Under Marketing Agreement with EarlyBirdCapital 
 
 Prior to the Closing of the Business Combination, Moringa reached agreement with EarlyBirdCapital on the reduction, to 1.6 million, in the aggregate, of the fee payable to EarlyBirdCapital under the Marketing Agreement. Pursuant to the final invoice provided by EarlyBirdCapital under the Marketing Agreement at the Closing, Moringa paid 350,000 of cash to EarlyBirdCapital from the trust account at the Closing, and we issued to EarlyBirdCapital a convertible promissory note, due December 31, 2025, in an amount of 1.25 million to be paid by us to EarlyBirdCapital in cash and/or via conversion of outstanding amounts into ordinary shares (the EarlyBird Convertible Note ). 
 
 The EarlyBird Convertible Note bears interest at a rate of 6 per annum and matures on December 31, 2025. If not repaid on or prior to that maturity date or such earlier date as to which the repayment obligation may be accelerated under the note, or not converted in accordance with the terms thereof, the rate of interest applicable to the unpaid principal amount would be adjusted to (15 per annum. We are required to make mandatory prepayments on the note (which shall first be applied to accrued interest and then to principal) from time to time in amounts equal to ten percent (10 of the gross proceeds received by us from any equity financings consummated by us prior to the maturity date. We are entitled to voluntarily prepay any additional part of, or all of, the principal and accrued interest, in one or more installments without penalty, prior to the maturity date. 
 
 4 

EarlyBirdCapital, in turn, may elect, at its sole discretion, at any time on or prior to the maturity date, to elect to convert all or part of the then outstanding principal and/or accrued interest under the EarlyBird Convertible Note into ordinary shares, at a per share conversion price equal to 95 of the volume weighted average price of an ordinary share for the five trading days immediately prior to the date of our receipt of a conversion notice, provided, however, we are not required to issue, and EarlyBirdCapital may not elect to convert the principal and/or accrued interest into an aggregate number of ordinary shares that would exceed the maximum number of ordinary shares permitted by Section 5635 of the Nasdaq Listing Rules to be issued without the approval of our shareholders, unless such approval is obtained. 
 
 Through the date of this Quarterly Report, we have made one payment of 100,000 to EarlyBirdCapital due to amounts raised by us under the ELOC. 

The foregoing summary is qualified in its entirety by the full text of the final invoice provided by EarlyBirdCapital under the Marketing Agreement at the Closing, and the EarlyBird Convertible Note, which serve as Exhibits 10.1.1 and 10.1.2 to the Super Form 8-K. 
 
 PIPE Financing 
 
 In connection with, and immediately prior to the Closing of, the Business Combination, Moringa raised 2.0 million via a private investment in public entity financing (the PIPE Financing ), whereby Moringa sold to Greenstar, LP, an affiliate of the Moringa sponsor (the PIPE Investor ), 200,000 newly issued Moringa ordinary shares at a price of 10.00 per share, pursuant to a subscription agreement, dated as of August 15, 2024, by and among Moringa, New Silexion and the PIPE Investor (the PIPE Agreement ). Those 200,000 shares automatically converted upon the Closing of the Business Combination into an equivalent number of New Silexion ordinary shares (the PIPE Shares ). 
 
 The funds raised from the PIPE Financing, together with remaining funds in the trust account after payments to redeeming public shareholders, were used for financing support for Moringa and New Silexion, as well as for payment to service providers to whom outstanding amounts were owed by Moringa, including parties that had provided financial advisory services and capital markets advisory services to Moringa during the period leading up to the Closing. 
 
 The foregoing summary is qualified in its entirety by the full text of the PIPE Agreement, a copy of which was attached as Exhibit 10.2 to the Super Form 8-K. 
 
 Issuance of Amended and Restated Sponsor Promissory Note 
 
 Effective as of the Closing, we issued to the sponsor, and the sponsor accepted, in amendment and restatement, and replacement, in their entirety, of all existing promissory notes issued by Moringa to the sponsor from the IPO until the Closing (and as to which the obligations of Moringa were assigned to New Silexion upon the Closing), an amended and restated promissory note (the A R Sponsor Promissory Note in an amount of 3,433,000, which reflected the total amount owed by Moringa to the sponsor through the Closing Date. The maturity date of the A R Sponsor Promissory Note is the 30-month anniversary of the Closing Date (i.e., February 15, 2027). Amounts outstanding under the A R Sponsor Promissory Note may be repaid (unless otherwise decided by us) only by way of conversion into ordinary shares Note Shares in accordance with the terms set forth in the form of A R Sponsor Promissory Note. New Silexion and the Sponsor may also convert amounts outstanding under the A R Sponsor Promissory Note at the price per share at which we conduct an equity financing following the Closing, subject to a minimum conversion amount of 100,000, in an amount of Note Shares constituting up to thirty percent (30 of the number of ordinary shares issued and sold by us in such equity financing. The sponsor may also elect to convert amounts of principal outstanding under the note into ordinary shares at any time following the 24-month anniversary of the date of the Closing, subject to a minimum conversion of 10,000, at a price per share equal to the volume weighted average price of the ordinary shares on the principal market on which they are traded during the 20 consecutive trading days prior to the conversion date.

 Components of Silexion s Results of Operations 
 
 In this section, the components of, and the actual, results of operations that are presented are: 

for the periods from January 1, 2024 (for the nine-month results) or July 1, 2024 (for the three-month results) through August 15, 2024 (the date of the Business Combination), those of Silexion (which was the accounting acquirer in the Business Combination and our predecessor entity); 

for the remaining period from August 16, 2024 through September 30, 2024, those of the combined company; and 

for the corresponding three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2023, those of Silexion alone.

 Operating Expenses 
 
 Research and Development Expenses 
 
 Research and development expenses include costs directly attributable to the conduct of research and development programs, including the cost of payroll and related expenses, payroll taxes and other employee benefits including share-based compensation related to employees, subcontractors, lab expenses, preclinical and clinical trials cost, material costs and consulting fees. 
 
 We expect to continue to invest in research and development to develop SIL-204, including hiring additional employees and continuing the research and development of that product candidate. As a result, we expect that our research and development expenses will continue to increase in the future. 
 
 6 

General and Administrative Expenses 
 
 General and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs, including share-based compensation related to directors and employees, patent application fees, office space rental costs, and maintenance expenses, external professional service costs, including legal, accounting, audit, finance, human resource services, travel expenses and other consulting fees. 
 
 We expect that our general and administrative expenses will increase in the future to fund our continued research and development activities, primarily due to increased headcount to support anticipated growth in the business and due to incremental costs associated with operating as a public company, including costs to comply with the rules and regulations applicable to public companies such as costs related to compliance and reporting obligations pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC and stock exchange listing standards, public relations, insurance and professional services.

This increase was mainly due to an increase in an amount of 4.8 million in one-time loss upon entering Transactions, offset, in part, by an increase in revaluation income of financial instruments (warrants and promissory notes) in the amount of 1.1 million. 

Net loss 
 
 Net loss increased by approximately 11.1 million, or 1,387.5 , to 11.9 million for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, compared to 0.8 million for the three-month period ended September 30, 2023. The increase was mainly due to an increase in our research and development expenses, general and administrative expenses, and financial expenses including significant non-cash items related to share-based compensation, transaction costs and costs related to becoming a public company. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 Overview 
 
 Our capital requirements will depend on many factors, including the timing and extent of spending to further develop our SIL-204 and initiate pre-clinical and clinical trials, support research and development efforts, investments in potential additional pipe-line products, and increased overall compensation as we continue to hire additional personnel. For the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we (or Silexion, as applicable) had a net loss of 14.8 million and 3.4 million, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, our cash and cash equivalents totaled 2.0 million. 

To date, our principal sources of liquidity have been proceeds from private offerings of our (or Silexion s, for periods prior to the Business Combination) ordinary shares and convertible preferred shares, grants from the Israeli Innovation Authority, and issuance of convertible financing agreements (CFA) and Simple Agreement for Future Equity (SAFE). 
 
 Based on our current business plan, we believe that current cash and cash equivalents will not be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements for the next 12 months. We will need to raise additional capital to finance our operations, expand our business and pipeline, or for other reasons. 

10 

Silexion s audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023 included in the proxy statement/prospectus, and our unaudited condensed financial statements for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 included in this Quarterly Report, note that there is substantial doubt about Silexion s or our (as applicable) ability to continue as a going concern as of such date; and in its report accompanying Silexion s audited consolidated financial statements included in the proxy statement/prospectus, Silexion s independent registered public accounting firm included an explanatory paragraph stating that Silexion s recurring losses from operations and its cash outflows from operating activities raise substantial doubt as to its ability to continue as a going concern. This means that Silexion s management and its independent registered public accounting firm have expressed substantial doubt about Silexion s ability to continue its operations without an additional infusion of capital from external sources. Silexion s unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis and do not include any adjustments that may be necessary should Silexion be unable to continue as a going concern. If we are unable to finance our operations (conducted via Silexion), our business would be in jeopardy and we might not be able to continue operations and might have to liquidate our assets. In that case, investors might receive less than the value at which those assets were carried on our unaudited condensed financial statements for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, and it is likely that investors would lose all or a part of their investment. 
 
 We have lease obligations and other contractual obligations and commitments as part of its ordinary course of business. See Note 4: Operating Leases and Note 6: Commitments and Contingent Liabilities to Silexion s consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023 (as contained in the proxy statement/prospectus) for information about our (then Silexion s) lease obligations. 
 
 We did not have during the periods presented, and do not currently have, any off-balance sheet arrangements involving commitments or obligations, including contingent obligations, arising from arrangements with unconsolidated entities or persons that have or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on its financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, cash requirements or capital resources. 
 
 ELOC 
 
 The ELOC has served as the primary source of financing for us in the period following the Closing of the Business Combination and effectiveness of the registration statement that was filed pursuant to the ELOC Registration Rights Agreement. Please see Overview-Recent Developments Impacting Our Financial Condition and Outlook- ELOC Financing in this Item 2 for more information. 
 
 PIPE Financing 
 
 We raised 2.0 million from the PIPE Financing as an additional source of financing for Silexion in the period following the Business Combination, which was completed immediately prior to the Closing. Please see Overview-Recent Developments Impacting Our Financial Condition and Outlook- PIPE Financing in this Item 2 for more information 
 
 Government Grants 
 
 Our research and development efforts have been financed, in part, through royalty-bearing grants from the Israeli Innovation Authority, or the IIA. As of September 30, 2024, we have received IIA royalty-bearing grants totaling approximately 5.8 million. 

We are committed to pay royalties to the IIA at a rate of approximately 3.0 to 5.0 of the sales of all of its product candidates and other related revenues generated from such projects, that were developed, in whole or in part, using the IIA royalty-bearing grants we received under IIA programs up to the total amount of royalty-bearing grants received, linked to the U.S. dollar and bearing annual interest at rates prescribed by the IIA s rules and guidelines. 
 
 11 

We may in the future apply to receive additional grants from the IIA. However, we cannot predict whether we will be entitled to any future grants, or the amounts of any such grants. 
 
 Under the Israeli Innovation Law, research and development programs that meet specified criteria and are approved by a committee of the IIA are eligible for grants. A company that receives a royalty-bearing grant from the IIA is typically required to pay royalties to the IIA on income generated from products incorporating IIA-funded know-how (including income derived from services associated with such products and from IIA-funded know-how), up to 100 of the U.S. dollar-linked royalty-bearing grant amount plus interest. 
 
 The obligation to pay royalties is contingent on actual income generated from such products and services. In the absence of such income, no payment of royalties is required. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, the total royalty amount that may be payable by us was approximately 5.8 million 6.5 million including interest).

 Cash Flows from Operating Activities 
 
 Net cash used in operating activities increased by approximately 2 million, or 285.7 , to 2.7 million for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, compared to 0.7 million for the three-month period ended September 30, 2023. This increase was mainly from an increase of 11.1 million in the net loss for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, and from an increase of 0.4 million in change of net working capital, offset by (i) an increase of 5.8 million in non-cash share-based compensation and (ii) an increase of 3.6 million in non-cash financial expenses included in the net loss. 

Cash Flows from Investing Activities 
 
 Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities decreased by 0.6 million, or 100 , to 0 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, compared to 0.6 million of cash provided by investing activities in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023. This decrease was mainly due to a reduction in short-term deposits in an amount of 0.5 million, which cash was used for operating activities.

Cash Flows from Financing Activities 
 
 Net cash provided by financing activities increased by 2.4 million, or 480 , to approximately 2.9 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, compared to 0.5 million the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023. This increase was mainly due to an increase in cash received from transactions upon the closing of the Business Combination in an amount of 2.3 million and from an increase in proceeds from issuance of ordinary shares under the ELOC in an amount of 0.6 million, offset by a decrease of 0.5 million in proceeds from issuance of preferred shares, occurred in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023.

This increase was mainly from an increase of 11.1 million in the net loss for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, and from an increase of 0.4 million in change of net working capital, offset by (i) an increase of 5.8 million in share-based compensation and (ii) an increase of 3.6 million in non-cash financial expenses included in the net loss. 

Cash Flows from Investing Activities 
 
 Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities decreased by 0.1 million, or 100 , to 0.0 million for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, compared to cash provided by investing activities of 0.1 million for the three-month period ended September 30, 2023. This decrease was mainly due to sales of property and equipment in the amount of 0.1 million in the three-month period ended September 30, 2023 (which sales were not repeated in the three-month period ended September 30, 2024). 

Cash Flows from Financing Activities

This increase was mainly due to an increase in cash received from transactions in connection with the closing of the Business Combination in an amount of 2.3 million and from an increase in proceeds from issuance of ordinary shares under the ELOC in an amount of 0.6 million. 

Funding Requirements 
 
 We expect to devote substantial financial resources to our ongoing and planned activities, particularly further development of SIL-204 and as we conduct our planned pre-clinical and clinical trials. 
 
 13 

Identifying potential product candidates and conducting pre-clinical testing and clinical trials is a time-consuming, expensive, and uncertain process that takes years to complete, and we may never generate the necessary data or results required to obtain marketing approval and achieve product sales. In addition, our product candidates, if approved, may not achieve commercial success. For additional information please refer to the Risk Factors section of the proxy statement/prospectus, including Risks Related to Silexion s and New Silexion s Financial Condition and Capital Requirement - Silexion has never generated any revenue from product sales and may never be profitable and Risks Related to the Research and Development of Silexion s Product Candidates - Silexion is heavily dependent on the success of its product candidates... . 
 
 We expect our expenses to increase substantially in connection with our ongoing activities, particularly as we advance our pre-clinical studies and clinical trials. In addition, if we obtain marketing approval for SIL-204 in any indication or for any other product candidate we are developing or may develop in the future, we expect to incur significant commercialization expenses related to product manufacturing, sales, marketing, and distribution. Furthermore, as a result of the Closing of the Business Combination, we expect to incur additional costs associated with operating as a public company. Accordingly, we will need to obtain substantial additional funding. 
 
 Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including: 

Material cost. 

Regulatory pathway; and 

Humam clinical trial costs. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of 2.0 million. Based on our then-current cash balance, as well as our history of operating losses and negative cash flows from operations, combined with our anticipated use of cash to, among other things, (i) fund the preclinical and clinical development of our products, (ii) identify and develop new product candidates, and (iii) seek approval for SIL-204 and any other product candidates we may develop, our management has concluded that we do not have sufficient cash to fund our operations for 12 months from the date of this Quarterly Report without additional financing, and as a result, there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. 
 
 In making this determination, applicable accounting standards prohibited us from considering the potential mitigating effect of plans that have not been fully implemented as of the date of our unaudited condensed financial statements for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, including, without limitation, the plans to raise additional capital. Our financial information, including our unaudited condensed financial statements for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 included in this Quarterly Report, has been prepared on a basis that assumes that we will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. This financial information and our unaudited condensed financial statements for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 do not include any adjustments that may result from an unfavorable outcome of this uncertainty. 
 
 We believe that as of the date of this Quarterly Report, we do not have cash sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements for the next 12 months. 

We have based these estimates and expectations on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and our operating plan may change as a result of many factors currently unknown to us. We could not, as of the September 30, 2024 balance sheet date of the unaudited condensed financial statements for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, determine the exact level of funds that will be available to us upon potential equity financings. Our expected use of funds represents our intentions based upon our current plans and business condition, which could change in the future as our plans and business condition evolve and the level of funding available to us becomes clear. In addition, changing circumstances could cause us to consume capital significantly faster than we currently anticipate, and we may need to spend more than currently expected because of circumstances beyond our control. As a result, we could deplete our capital resources sooner than we currently expect. In addition, because the successful development of SIL-204 and any studies or other product candidates that we pursue is highly uncertain, at this time we cannot reasonably estimate or know the nature, timing and costs of the efforts that will be necessary to complete the development of any product candidate. 
 
 14 

Until such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial revenues from our product sales, we expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of public and private equity offerings and debt financings, strategic alliances, collaborations, and marketing, distribution, or licensing arrangements. However, adequate additional financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all, and may be impacted by the economic climate and market conditions. 
 
 Reliance on the ELOC or other similar types of equity financings as a source of ongoing funding for our operations following the Business Combination could involve significant issuances of ordinary shares by us that could cause the following impacts (among others): 

significant dilution to the equity interests of our current shareholders; 

a deemed change of control of our company due to the issuance of a substantial number of ordinary shares, which may affect, among other things, our ability to use our net operating loss carry forwards, if any, and could result in a change in the officers and directors of our company relative to our current officers and directors, to the extent any shareholders build up significant beneficial ownership from ordinary shares issued pursuant to the ELOC; 

may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of our company by diluting the share ownership or voting rights of a person seeking to obtain control; and 

may adversely affect prevailing market prices for our ordinary shares or warrants. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 
 For a description of our significant accounting policies, see Note 2 to Silexion s consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023 included in the proxy statement/prospectus and our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 included in this Quarterly Report. 
 
 The preparation of Silexion s consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023 and our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 in conformity with U.S. GAAP required our management to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023 and unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and related footnotes. Actual results may differ from these estimates. We have based our judgments on our experience and on various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. 
 
 Of our policies, the following are considered critical to an understanding of Silexion s consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023 and our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 as they require the application of subjective and complex judgment, involving critical accounting estimates and assumptions impacting those consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023 and unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 15 

The critical accounting estimates relate to the following: 
 
 Share-Based Compensation 
 
 Share-based compensation expense related to share awards is recognized based on the fair value of the awards granted. The fair value of each option award is estimated on the grant date using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The Black-Scholes option pricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions, including, prior to the Business Combination, the fair value of the underlying ordinary shares (see below), the expected term of the option, and the expected volatility of the price of our ordinary shares. These estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management s judgment. The related share-based compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the awards, including awards with graded vesting and no additional conditions for vesting other than service conditions. Forfeitures are accounted for as they occur instead of estimating the number of awards expected to be forfeited. 

Our use of the Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions. If factors change and different assumptions are used, our share-based compensation expense could be materially different in the future. 
 
 We will continue to use judgment in evaluating the assumptions related to our share-based compensation on a prospective basis. As we continue to accumulate additional data related to our ordinary shares, we may refine our estimation process, which could materially impact our future share-based compensation expense. 
 
 Valuations of Instruments Convertible to Silexion Ordinary and Preferred Shares prior to the Business Combination 

Silexion s preferred shares were classified as temporary equity, as they included clauses that could constitute as in-substance redemption clauses that were outside Silexion s control. Warrants and other instruments over Silexion s preferred shares were classified as liabilities under ASC 480 and measured at fair value, with subsequent changes in fair value recognized in the statements of operations in each period. 
 
 The fair value of Silexion s preferred shares underlying Silexion s convertible instruments was determined by Silexion s board of directors, after considering contemporaneous third-party valuations and input from management. Prior to the Business Combination, in the absence of a public trading market, Silexion s board of directors, with input from management, exercised significant judgment and considered various objective and subjective factors to determine the fair value of Silexion s equity including the following factors: 

History of transactions in Silexion s preferred shares; 

Probability of an IPO scenario (including de SPAC transaction); 

Probability of other liquidation events; 

Expected time to liquidation; and 

Expected return on equity. 
 
 The resulting equity value was then allocated to each share class based on differences in liquidation preferences of the various share classes using an Option Pricing Model OPM through the use of a series of call options and by implementing a Monte Carlo simulation. The OPM allocates the overall company value to the various share classes based on differences in liquidation preferences, using a series of call options. The OPM is appropriate to use when the range of possible future outcomes is difficult to predict. Starting from 2023, for the IPO scenario (including de SPAC transaction) Silexion utilized a probability-weighted expected return method PWERM to allocate value among the various share classes. The PWERM involves the estimation of the value of the company under multiple future potential outcomes and estimates the probability of each potential outcome. After the value of each applicable class of shares was determined, a discount for lack of marketability DLOM was applied to arrive at the fair value of the ordinary shares on a non-marketable basis. A DLOM is applied in order to reflect the lack of a recognized market for a closely held interest and the fact that a non-controlling equity interest may not be readily transferable. A market participant purchasing this share would recognize this illiquidity associated with the shares, which would reduce the overall fair market value. 
 
 16 

In some cases, Silexion considered the amount of time between rounds of financing to determine whether to use a mid price calculation between two dates. 
 
 Upon completion of the Business Combination, our ordinary shares are publicly traded, and we rely on the closing price of our ordinary shares as reported on the date of the applicable valuations. 
 
 The fair value of the warrants for the purchase of preferred shares was calculated using the OPM as part of the allocation of the equity value to the various share classes (as described above). 
 
 Valuation of Private Warrants 
 
 As part of the Business Combination, we assumed a derivative warrant liability related to previously issued private warrants in connection with Moringa s initial public offering. The private warrants were classified as a liability. We utilize a Black-Scholes model option pricing model to estimate the fair value of the private warrants. The volatility of the private warrants is based on implied volatility of the publicly traded warrants and the historical volatility of our share price and of a selected peer companies that matches the expected remaining life of the warrants. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury zero-coupon yield curve as of the valuation date for a maturity similar to the expiration of the warrants. The dividend yield is based on the historical rate, which we anticipate remaining at zero. 
 
 Valuation of Promissory Notes 
 
 As part of the Business Combination, we issued to Moringa s sponsor, as well as EarlyBird Capital, Inc. promissory notes, which we irrevocably designated to be measured at fair value. The fair value Promissory Notes is measured using a discount rate based on a B- rated US dollar zero-coupon discount curve, plus a credit spread of 6.67 . The discount rate was determined with reference to benchmark interest rates of secured loans reported by venture capitals, which were then used to extract our entity-specific credit spread. The expected timing of conversion or redemption of the notes was determined using the management s forecasts. 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
 
 See Note 2 on page F-29 to Silexion s financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023 included in the proxy statement/prospectus for a description of recent accounting pronouncements applicable to Silexion s financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 ITEM 3 . QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 
 Our funds are invested in demand-deposit interest-bearing bank accounts. The interest accruing in those accounts is subject to fluctuation based on market changes in interest rates. We do not believe that any fluctuation in market interest rates will materially impact the value of those funds in those accounts. 
 
 ITEM 4 . CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 Disclosure controls are procedures that are designed with the objective of ensuring that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act, such as this Report, is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time period specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls are also designed with the objective of ensuring that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including the chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 
 Our management evaluated, with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, whom we refer to as our Certifying Officers, the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024, pursuant to Rule 13a-15(b) or Rule 15d-15(b) under the Exchange Act. 
 
 Based upon that evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
 During the most recently completed fiscal quarter, there has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
