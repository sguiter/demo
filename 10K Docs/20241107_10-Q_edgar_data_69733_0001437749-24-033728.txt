and , respectively, and was based upon review of observable pricing in secondary markets as of March 31, 2024. Accordingly, the Company classified it as Level 2. 

Certain non-financial assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis; that is, the assets and liabilities are not measured at fair value on an ongoing basis but are subject to fair value adjustments in certain circumstances, such as when evidence of impairment exists. At September 29, 2024, no fair value adjustment or material fair value measurements were required for non-financial assets or liabilities.

Less: allowance for credit losses 

Accounts and other receivables, net 

Our provision for credit losses is based on the current expected credit losses model. The Company is exposed to credit losses through its trade accounts receivable. Trade accounts receivable are generally due within 30 days and are stated at amounts due from franchisees, including virtual kitchens, retail licensees and Branded Product Program customers, net of an allowance for credit losses. Accounts that are outstanding longer than the contractual payment terms are generally considered past due. 

An allowance for credit losses is determined by pooling financial assets based on similar risk characteristics and delinquency status under an aging method at the measurement date. The Company considers both qualitative and quantitative information when developing the estimate including assessments of collectability based on historical trends, the financial condition of the Company s franchisees, licensees and Branded Product Program customers, including any known or anticipated bankruptcies, and an evaluation of current economic conditions as well as the Company s expectations of conditions in the future. 

The Company provides for expected credit losses through a charge to earnings. After the Company has used reasonable collection efforts, it writes off accounts receivable through a charge to the allowance for credit losses. 

Changes in the Company s allowance for credit losses for the twenty-six week period ended September 29, 2024 and the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024 are as follows (in thousands):

The Company tests for recoverability based on the projected undiscounted cash flows to be derived from such assets. If the projected undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset, the Company will record on a restaurant-by-restaurant basis, an impairment loss, if any, based on the difference between the estimated fair value and the carrying value of the asset. The Company generally measures fair value by considering discounted estimated future cash flows from such assets. Cash flow projections and fair value estimates require significant estimates and assumptions by management. Should the estimates and assumptions prove to be incorrect, the Company may be required to record impairment charges in future periods and such impairments could be material. 

There have been no significant events or changes in circumstances during the thirteen and twenty-six week periods ended September 29, 2024 that would indicate that the carrying amount of the Company s long-lived assets may be impaired as of September 29, 2024.

Interest rate 

Volatility 

Dividend yield 

The expected dividend yield is based on historical and projected dividend yields. The Company estimates volatility based primarily on historical monthly price changes of the Company s stock equal to the expected life of the option. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield in effect at the time of grant. The expected option term is the number of years the Company estimates the options will be outstanding prior to exercise based on expected historical exercise patterns and employment termination behavior.

Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 

Forward-Looking Statements 

This Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1933, as amended (the Exchange Act ), that involve risks and uncertainties. You can identify forward-looking statements because they contain words such as believes, expects, projects, may, would, should, seeks, intends, plans, estimates, anticipates or similar expressions that relate to our strategy, plans or intentions. All statements we make relating to our estimated and projected earnings, margins, costs, expenditures, cash flows, growth rates and financial results or to our expectations regarding future industry trends are forward-looking statements. In addition, we, through our senior management, from time to time make forward-looking public statements concerning our expected future operations and performance and other developments. These forward-looking statements are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may change at any time, and, therefore, our actual results may differ materially from those that we expected. We derive many of our forward-looking statements from our operating budgets and forecasts, which are based upon many detailed assumptions. While we believe that our assumptions are reasonable, we caution that it is very difficult to predict the impact of known factors, and, of course, it is impossible for us to anticipate all factors that could affect our actual results. All forward-looking statements contained in this Form 10-Q are based upon information available to us on the date of this Form 10-Q. 

Statements in this Form 10-Q quarterly report may be forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements that express our intentions, beliefs, expectations, strategies, predictions or any other statements relating to our future activities or other future events or conditions. These statements are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about our business based, in part, on assumptions made by management. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. These risks and uncertainties, many of which are not within our control, include but are not limited to: the impact of disease epidemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic; increases in the cost of food and paper products; the impact of price increases on customer visits; the status of our licensing and supply agreements, including our licensing revenue and overall profitability being substantially dependent on our agreement with Smithfield Foods, Inc.; the impact of our debt service and repayment obligations under our Credit Agreement, including the effect on our ability to fund working capital, operations and make investments; economic (including inflationary pressures like those currently being experienced); weather (including the impact on sales at our restaurants particularly during the summer months); changes in the price of beef and beef trimmings; our ability to pass on the cost of any price increases in beef and beef trimmings; legislative and business conditions; the collectability of receivables; changes in consumer tastes; the continued viability of Coney Island as a destination location for visitors; the ability to attract franchisees; the impact of the minimum wage legislation on labor costs in New York State or other changes in labor laws, including regulations which could render a franchisor as a joint employer or the impact of our union contracts; our ability to attract competent restaurant and managerial personnel; the enforceability of international franchising agreements; the future effects of any food borne illness such as bovine spongiform encephalopathy, BSE or e-coli; as well as those risks discussed from time to time in this Form 10-Q and our Form 10-K annual report for the year ended March 31, 2024, and in other documents we file with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Therefore, actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or forecasted in the forward-looking statements. We generally identify forward-looking statements with the words believe, intend, plan, expect, anticipate, estimate, will, should and similar expressions. Any forward-looking statements speak only as of the date on which they are made, and we do not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this Form 10-Q. 

Introduction 

As used in this Report, the terms we , us , our , Nathan s or the Company mean Nathan s Famous, Inc. and its subsidiaries (unless the context indicates a different meaning). 

We are engaged primarily in the marketing of the Nathan s Famous brand and the sale of products bearing the Nathan s Famous trademarks through several different channels of distribution. Historically, our business has been the operation and franchising of quick-service restaurants featuring Nathan s World Famous Beef Hot Dogs, crinkle-cut French fries, and a variety of other menu offerings. Our Company-owned and franchised restaurants operate under the name Nathan s Famous, the name first used at our original Coney Island restaurant opened in 1916. Nathan s product licensing program sells packaged hot dogs; frozen crinkle-cut French fries and additional products to retail customers through supermarkets, grocery channels and club stores for off-site consumption. Our Branded Product Program enables foodservice retailers and others to sell some of Nathan s proprietary products outside of the realm of a traditional franchise relationship. In conjunction with this program, purchasers of Nathan s products are granted a limited use of the Nathan s Famous trademark with respect to the sale of the purchased products, including Nathan s World Famous Beef Hot Dogs, certain other proprietary food items and paper goods. Our Branded Menu Program is a limited franchise program, under which foodservice operators may sell a greater variety of Nathan s Famous menu items than under the Branded Product Program. 

-20-

Our revenues are generated primarily from selling products under Nathan s Branded Product Program, operating Company-owned restaurants, licensing agreements for the sale of Nathan s products within supermarkets, grocery stores and club stores, the sale of Nathan s products directly to other foodservice operators, the manufacture of certain proprietary spices by third parties and the royalties, fees and other sums we can earn from franchising the Nathan s restaurant concept (including the Branded Menu Program and virtual kitchens). 

At September 29, 2024, our restaurant system, excluding virtual kitchens, consisted of 243 locations, including 128 Branded Menu Program locations, and four Company-owned restaurants (including one seasonal unit), located in 17 states, and 13 foreign countries. 

At September 24, 2023, our restaurant system, excluding virtual kitchens, consisted of 235 locations, including 117 Branded Menu Program locations, and four Company-owned restaurants (including one seasonal unit), located in 17 states, and 13 foreign countries. 

Our primary focus is to expand the market penetration of the Nathan s Famous brand by increasing the number of distribution points for our products across all of our business platforms, including our Licensing Program for distribution of Nathan s Famous branded consumer packaged goods, our Branded Products Program for distribution of Nathan s Famous branded bulk products to the foodservice industry, and our namesake restaurant system comprised of both Company-owned restaurants and franchised locations, including virtual kitchens. The primary drivers of our growth have been our Licensing and Branded Product Programs which have been the largest contributors to the Company s revenues and profits. 

While we do not expect to significantly increase the number of Company-owned restaurants, we may opportunistically and strategically invest in a small number of new units as showcase locations for prospective franchisees and master developers as we seek to grow our franchise system. We continue to seek opportunities to drive sales in a variety of ways as we adapt to the ever-changing consumer and business climate. 

As described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2024, our future results could be materially impacted by many developments including our dependence on Smithfield Foods, Inc. as our principal supplier and the dependence of our licensing revenue and overall profitability on our agreement with Smithfield Foods, Inc. In addition, our future operating results could be impacted by supply constraints on beef or by increased costs of beef, beef trimmings and other commodities due to inflationary pressures compared to earlier periods. 

As described below, we are also including information relating to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, which are non-GAAP financial measures, in this Form 10-Q quarterly report. See Reconciliation of GAAP and Non-GAAP Measures. 

Recent events 

Refinancing of Senior Secured Notes due 2025 

On July 10, 2024, the Company entered into a five-year unsecured Credit Agreement with Citibank, N.A. and borrowed 60,000,000 in Term Loan borrowings to refinance and redeem the 6.625 Senior Secured Notes due 2025 (the 2025 Notes ). See NOTE P LONG TERM DEBT of the preceding consolidated financial statements and Liquidity and Capital Resources for additional information on the Credit Agreement and refinancing. Our future results may be impacted by our debt service and repayment obligations under our Credit Agreement. 

Inflationary Factors 

Inflationary pressures impacted our results of operations during the first half of fiscal 2025, including higher commodity prices on beef and beef trimmings. This trend may continue throughout the remainder of fiscal year 2025. In general, we have been able to offset cost increases resulting from inflation by increasing prices and adjusting product mix. We continue to monitor these inflationary pressures and will continue to implement mitigation measures as needed. Inherent volatility in commodity markets, including beef and beef trimmings, could have a significant impact on our results of operations. Delays in implementing price increases, competitive pressures, a decline in consumer spending levels and other factors may limit our ability to implement further price increases in the future.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 

As discussed in our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024, the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America US GAAP ). The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses reported in those consolidated financial statements. These judgments can be subjective and complex, and consequently, actual results could differ from those estimates. Our most critical accounting policies and estimates relate to impairment of intangible assets; impairment of long-lived assets; current expected credit losses and income taxes (including uncertain tax positions). There have been no changes to our critical accounting estimates or significant accounting policies as disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024. 

New Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted 

Please refer to Note B of the preceding consolidated financial statements for our discussion of the New Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted. 

EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA 

The Company believes that EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, which are non-GAAP financial measures, are useful to investors to assist in assessing and understanding the Company's operating performance and underlying trends in the Company's business because EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are (i) among the measures used by management in evaluating performance and (ii) are frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties as a common performance measure. 

Reconciliation of GAAP and Non-GAAP Measures 

The following is provided to supplement certain Non-GAAP financial measures. 

In addition to disclosing results that are determined in accordance with US GAAP, the Company has provided EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, which is defined as net income excluding (i) interest expense; (ii) provision for income taxes and (iii) depreciation and amortization expense. The Company has also provided Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, which is defined as EBITDA, excluding (i) the loss on debt extinguishment and (ii) share-based compensation that the Company believes will impact the comparability of its results of operations. 

EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not recognized terms under US GAAP and should not be viewed as alternatives to net income or other measures of financial performance or liquidity in conformity with US GAAP. Additionally, our definitions of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may differ from other companies. Analysis of results and outlook on a non-US GAAP basis should be used as a complement to, and in conjunction with, data presented in accordance with US GAAP. 

The following is a reconciliation of net income to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA (in thousands):

Seasonality 

Our routine business pattern is affected by seasonal fluctuations, including the effects of weather and economic conditions. Historically, sales from our Company-owned restaurants, principally at Coney Island, and franchised restaurants from which franchised royalties are earned and the Company s earnings have been highest during our first two fiscal quarters, with the fourth quarter representing the slowest period. Additionally, revenues from our Branded Product Program, Branded Menu Program and retail licensing program generally follow similar season fluctuations, although not to the same degree. We expect that this seasonality will continue. Working capital requirements may vary throughout the year to support these seasonal patterns. 

Due to the above seasonal factors, as well as inflationary pressures, our results of operations for the thirteen and twenty-six weeks ended September 29, 2024 are not necessarily indicative of those for a full fiscal year. 

Results of Operations 

Thirteen weeks ended September 29, 2024 compared to thirteen weeks ended September 24, 2023 

Revenues 

Total revenues increased by approximately 6 to 41,109,000 for the thirteen weeks ended September 29, 2024 second quarter fiscal 2025 as compared to 38,744,000 for the thirteen weeks ended September 24, 2023 second quarter fiscal 2024 ). 

Foodservice sales from the Branded Product Program increased by approximately 5 to 24,536,000 for the second quarter fiscal 2025 as compared to 23,352,000 for the second quarter fiscal 2024. During the second quarter fiscal 2025, the volume of hot dogs sold in the Branded Product Program increased by approximately 4 as compared to the second quarter fiscal 2024. Our average selling prices increased by approximately 1.4 as compared to the second quarter fiscal 2024. 

Total Company-owned restaurant sales increased by approximately 3 to 5,348,000 during the second quarter fiscal 2025 as compared to 5,193,000 during the second quarter fiscal 2024. Restaurant sales were impacted by higher sales at our Coney Island locations due to an increase in our average check, offset by lower sales at our locations in Oceanside and Yonkers, New York. 

License royalties increased by approximately 14 to 9,491,000 in the second quarter fiscal 2025 as compared to 8,339,000 in the second quarter fiscal 2024. Total royalties earned on sales of hot dogs from our license agreement with Smithfield Foods, Inc. at retail and foodservice, increased 14 to 8,595,000 for the second quarter fiscal 2025 as compared to 7,507,000 in the second quarter fiscal 2024. The increase is due to an 18 increase in retail volume which was offset, in part, by a 4 decrease in net selling price . The foodservice business earned higher royalties of 39,000 as compared to the second quarter fiscal 2024. Royalties earned from all other licensing agreements for the manufacture and sale of Nathan s products increased by 64,000 during the second quarter fiscal 2025 as compared to the second quarter fiscal 2024 primarily due to higher royalties earned on sales of proprietary spices, franks-in-a-blanket, mozzarella sticks and other hors d oeuvres. 

Franchise fees and royalties decreased by approximately 9 to 1,174,000 in the second quarter fiscal 2025 as compared to 1,291,000 in the second quarter fiscal 2024. Total royalties were 1,066,000 in the second quarter fiscal 2025 as compared to 1,148,000 in the second quarter fiscal 2024. Royalties earned under the Branded Menu Program were 248,000 in the second quarter fiscal 2025 as compared to 272,000 in the second quarter fiscal 2024. Royalties earned under the Branded Menu Program are not based upon a percentage of restaurant sales but are based upon product purchases. Virtual kitchen royalties were 11,000 in the second quarter fiscal 2025 as compared to 18,000 in the second quarter fiscal 2024. Traditional franchise royalties were 807,000 in the second quarter fiscal 2025 as compared to 858,000 in the second quarter fiscal 2024. Franchise restaurant sales decreased to 18,681,000 in the second quarter fiscal 2025 as compared to 19,171,000 in the second quarter fiscal 2024 primarily due to lower traffic at international locations and other seasonal entertainment venues. Comparable domestic franchise sales (consisting of 59 Nathan s outlets, excluding sales under the Branded Menu Program) were 14,961,000 in the second quarter fiscal 2025 as compared to 15,286,000 in the second quarter fiscal 2024. 

At September 29, 2024, 243 franchised locations, including domestic, international and Branded Menu Program units were operating as compared to 235 franchised locations, including domestic, international and Branded Menu Program units at September 24, 2023. Total franchise fee income was 108,000 in the second quarter fiscal 2025 as compared to 143,000 in the second quarter fiscal 2024. Domestic franchise fee income was 35,000 in the second quarter fiscal 2025 as compared to 28,000 in the second quarter fiscal 2024. International franchise fee income was 59,000 in the second quarter fiscal 2025 as compared to 60,000 in the second quarter fiscal 2024. 

-23-

We recognized 14,000 and 55,000 in forfeited fees in the second quarter fiscal 2025 and the second quarter fiscal 2024, respectively. During the second quarter fiscal 2025, eighteen franchise locations opened and six franchise locations closed. During the second quarter fiscal 2024, seven franchise locations opened and seven franchise locations closed. 

Advertising fund revenue, after eliminating Company contributions, was 560,000 during the second quarter fiscal 2025 as compared to 569,000 during the second quarter fiscal 2024. 

Costs and Expenses 

Overall, our cost of sales increased by approximately 8 to 26,029,000 in the second quarter fiscal 2025 as compared to 24,187,000 in the second quarter fiscal 2024. Our gross profit (calculated as total Branded Products sales plus total Company-owned restaurant sales less cost of sales) was 3,855,000 or 13 during the second quarter fiscal 2025 as compared to 4,358,000 or 15 during the second quarter fiscal 2024. 

Cost of sales in the Branded Product Program increased by 9 to 23,318,000 in the second quarter fiscal 2025 as compared to 21,442,000 in the second quarter fiscal 2024, primarily due to a 4 increase in the volume of hot dogs sold, as well as a 5 increase in the average cost per pound of our hot dogs. A shrinking supply of cattle, combined with industry demand and inflationary pressures have resulted in higher commodity prices, including beef and beef trimmings, contributing to the increase in the average cost per pound of our hot dogs. We did not make any purchase commitments of beef during the second quarter fiscal 2025 or the second quarter fiscal 2024. If the cost of beef and beef trimmings increases and we are unable to pass on these higher costs through price increases or otherwise reduce any increase in our costs through the use of purchase commitments, our margins will be adversely impacted. With respect to Company-owned restaurants, our cost of sales during the second quarter fiscal 2025 was 2,711,000 or 51 of restaurant sales as compared to 2,745,000 or 53 of restaurant sales during the second quarter fiscal 2024. Food and paper costs as a percentage of Company-owned restaurant sales were 24.2 , down from 27.6 in the comparable period of the prior year driven, in part, by price increases across most menu offerings. Labor and related expenses as a percentage of Company-owned restaurant sales were 26.5 , up from 25.3 in the comparable period of the prior year due to higher salaries expense attributable to minimum wage increases as well as higher incentive compensation expense. 

Restaurant operating expenses were 1,389,000 in the second quarter fiscal 2025 as compared to 1,340,000 in the second quarter fiscal 2024. The increase is due primarily to higher occupancy expenses of 103,000 and higher insurance costs of 26,000 which were offset, in part, by lower marketing expenses of 23,000 and lower delivery charges of 23,000. As a percentage of Company-owned restaurant sales, restaurant operating expenses were 26 in the second quarter fiscal 2025 as compared to 25.8 in the second quarter fiscal 2024. 

Depreciation and amortization, which primarily consists of the depreciation of fixed assets, including leasehold improvements and equipment, and the amortization of a definite-lived intangible asset, was 247,000 in the second quarter fiscal 2025 as compared to 315,000 in the second quarter fiscal 2024. 

General and administrative expenses increased by 23,000 or 1 to 3,252,000 in the second quarter fiscal 2025 as compared to 3,229,000 in the second quarter fiscal 2024. The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to higher stock compensation expense of 47,000 and higher incentive compensation expense of 44,000 which were offset, in part, by lower professional fees of 39,000. 

Advertising fund expense, after eliminating Company contributions, was 560,000 during the second quarter fiscal 2025 as compared to 569,000 in the second quarter fiscal 2024. 

Other Items 

Interest expense of 1,441,000 in the second quarter fiscal 2025 represented interest expense of 458,000 and 930,000 on the 2025 Notes and the Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR Term Loan borrowings, respectively, and amortization of debt issuance costs of 35,000 and 18,000 on the 2025 Notes and the SOFR Term Loan borrowings, respectively. 

Interest expense of 1,413,000 in the second quarter fiscal 2024 represented interest expense of 1,321,000 on the 2025 Notes and amortization of debt issuance costs of 92,000. 

On July 10, 2024, the Company refinanced and redeemed its outstanding 2025 Notes. In connection with this transaction, the Company recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of 334,000 that reflected the write-off of the remainder of previously recorded debt issuance costs. 

Interest and dividend income of 219,000 in the second quarter fiscal 2025 represented amounts earned by the Company on its interest bearing bank and money market accounts and mutual funds as compared to 150,000 in the fiscal 2024 period. 

-24-

Other income, net was 23,000 in the second quarter fiscal 2025 and the second quarter fiscal 2024 which primarily relates to sublease income from a franchised restaurant. 

Provision for Income Taxes 

The effective income tax rate for the second quarter fiscal 2025 was 25.5 compared to 27.4 in the second quarter fiscal 2024. The effective income tax rate for the second quarter fiscal 2025 reflected income tax expense of 2,069,000 recorded on 8,099,000 of pre-tax income. The effective income tax rate for the second quarter fiscal 2024 reflected income tax expense of 2,153,000 recorded on 7,864,000 of pre-tax income. The effective tax rates are higher than the U.S. Federal statutory rates primarily due to state and local taxes as well as non-deductible compensation under the Internal Revenue Code Section 162(m). The effective tax rate for the second quarter fiscal 2024 included a discrete adjustment of 0.8 . 

The amount of unrecognized tax benefits at September 29, 2024 was 494,000 all of which would impact the Company s effective tax rate, if recognized. As of September 29, 2024, the Company had approximately 379,000 accrued for the payment of interest and penalties in conjunction with unrecognized tax benefits. 

Nathan s estimates that its unrecognized tax benefit excluding accrued interest and penalties could be further reduced by up to 46,000 during the fiscal year ending March 30, 2025 due primarily to the lapse of statutes of limitations which would favorably impact the Company s effective tax rate, although no assurances can be given in this regard. 

Results of Operations 

Twenty-six weeks ended September 29, 2024 compared to twenty-six weeks ended September 24, 2023 

Revenues 

Total revenues increased by approximately 6 to 85,876,000 for the twenty-six weeks ended September 29, 2024 fiscal 2025 period as compared to 80,729,000 for the twenty-six weeks ended September 24, 2023 fiscal 2024 period ).

Total Company-owned restaurant sales increased by approximately 8 to 9,547,000 during the fiscal 2025 period as compared to 8,851,000 during the fiscal 2024 period.

The increase is due to a 14 increase in retail volume which was offset, in part, by a 2 decrease in net selling price. The foodservice business earned higher royalties of 107,000 as compared to the fiscal 2024 period. Royalties earned from all other licensing agreements for the manufacture and sale of Nathan s products increased by 113,000 during the fiscal 2025 period as compared to the fiscal 2024 period primarily due to higher royalties earned on sales of French fries, onion rings, and proprietary spices, offset by lower royalties earned on sales of pickles, franks-in-a-blanket, mozzarella sticks and other hors d oeuvres. 

Franchise fees and royalties decreased by approximately 5 to 2,247,000 in the fiscal 2025 period as compared to 2,366,000 in the fiscal 2024 period.

Traditional franchise royalties were 1,599,000 in the fiscal 2025 period as compared to 1,625,000 in the fiscal 2024 period. Franchise restaurant sales decreased to 36,334,000 in the fiscal 2025 period as compared to 36,433,000 in the fiscal 2024 period primarily due to lower traffic at international locations, seasonal entertainment venues, and travel plazas which were offset, in part, by higher traffic at casino locations primarily in Las Vegas, Nevada. Comparable domestic franchise sales (consisting of 58 Nathan s outlets, excluding sales under the Branded Menu Program) were 29,037,000 in the fiscal 2025 period as compared to 29,388,000 in the fiscal 2024 period. 

-25-

At September 29, 2024, 243 franchised locations, including domestic, international and Branded Menu Program units were operating as compared to 235 franchised locations, including domestic, international and Branded Menu Program units at September 24, 2023. Total franchise fee income was 200,000 in the fiscal 2025 period as compared to 238,000 in the fiscal 2024 period. Domestic franchise fee income was 58,000 in the fiscal 2025 period as compared to 55,000 in the fiscal 2024 period. International franchise fee income was 119,000 in the fiscal 2025 period as compared to 120,000 in the fiscal 2024 period. 

We recognized 23,000 and 63,000 in forfeited fees in the fiscal 2025 period and fiscal 2024 period, respectively. During the fiscal 2025 period, twenty-one franchise locations opened and eight franchise locations closed. During the fiscal 2024 period, fourteen franchise locations opened and eleven franchise locations closed. 

Advertising fund revenue, after eliminating Company contributions, was 988,000 during the fiscal 2025 period as compared to 993,000 during the fiscal 2024 period. 

Costs and Expenses 

Overall, our cost of sales increased by approximately 5 to 51,270,000 in the fiscal 2025 period as compared to 48,871,000 in the fiscal 2024 period. Our gross profit (calculated as total Branded Products sales plus total Company-owned restaurant sales less cost of sales) was 8,959,000 or 15 during the fiscal 2025 period as compared to 8,502,000 or 15 during the fiscal 2024 period. 

Cost of sales in the Branded Product Program increased by 5 to 46,290,000 during the fiscal 2025 period as compared to 44,010,000 during the fiscal 2024 period, primarily due to a 2 increase in the volume of hot dogs sold, as well as a 3 increase in the average cost per pound of our hot dogs. A shrinking supply of cattle, combined with industry demand and inflationary pressures have resulted in higher commodity prices, including beef and beef trimmings, contributing to the increase in the average cost per pound of our hot dogs. We did not make any purchase commitments of beef during the fiscal 2025 and 2024 periods. If the cost of beef and beef trimmings increases and we are unable to pass on these higher costs through price increases or otherwise reduce any increase in our costs through the use of purchase commitments, our margins will be adversely impacted. With respect to Company-owned restaurants, our cost of sales during the fiscal 2025 period was 4,980,000 or 52 of restaurant sales, as compared to 4,861,000 or 55 of restaurant sales in the fiscal 2024 period. Food and paper costs as a percentage of Company-owned restaurant sales were 24.8 , down from 27.8 in the comparable period of the prior year driven, in part, by price increases across most menu offerings. Labor and related expenses as a percentage of Company-owned restaurant sales were 27.4 , up from 27.1 in the comparable period of the prior year due to higher salaries expense attributable to minimum wage increases as well as higher incentive compensation expense. 

Restaurant operating expenses were 2,518,000 in the fiscal 2025 period as compared to 2,383,000 in the fiscal 2024 period. The increase is due primarily to higher occupancy expenses of 147,000 and higher insurance costs of 54,000 which were offset, in part, by lower marketing expenses of 16,000 and lower delivery charges of 37,000. As a percentage of Company-owned restaurant sales, restaurant operating expenses were 26.4 in the fiscal 2025 period as compared to 26.9 in the fiscal 2024 period. 

Depreciation and amortization, which primarily consists of the depreciation of fixed assets, including leasehold improvements and equipment, and the amortization of a definite-lived intangible asset, was 496,000 in the fiscal 2025 period as compared to 628,000 in the fiscal 2024 period. 

General and administrative expenses decreased by approximately 60,000 or 1 to 7,227,000 in the fiscal 2025 period as compared to 7,287,000 in the fiscal 2024 period. The decrease in general and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to lower professional fees of 142,000, which were offset, in part, by higher incentive compensation expense of 57,000 and higher share-based compensation expense of 58,000. 

Advertising fund expense, after eliminating Company contributions, was 988,000 during the fiscal 2025 period as compared to 993,000 in the fiscal 2024 period. 

Other Items 

Interest expense of 2,501,000 in the fiscal 2025 period represented interest expense of 1,449,000 and 930,000 on the 2025 Notes and the SOFR Term Loan borrowings, respectively, and amortization of debt issuance costs of 104,000 and 18,000 on the 2025 Notes and the SOFR Term Loan borrowings, respectively. 

Interest expense of 2,827,000 in the fiscal 2024 period represented interest expense of 2,643,000 on the 2025 Notes and amortization of debt issuance costs of 184,000. 

-26-

On July 10, 2024, the Company refinanced and redeemed its outstanding 2025 Notes. In connection with this transaction, the Company recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of 334,000 that reflected the write-off of the remainder of previously recorded debt issuance costs. 

Interest and dividend income of 297,000 in the fiscal 2025 period represented amounts earned by the Company on its interest bearing bank and money market accounts and mutual funds, as compared to 212,000 in the fiscal 2024 period. 

Other income, net was 44,000 in the fiscal 2025 and fiscal 2024 periods which primarily relates to sublease income from a franchised restaurant. 

Provision for Income Taxes 

The effective income tax rate for the fiscal 2025 period was 26.7 compared to 27.2 in the fiscal 2024 period. The effective income tax rate for the fiscal 2025 period reflected income tax expense of 5,576,000 recorded on 20,883,000 of pre-tax income. The effective income tax rate for the fiscal 2024 period reflected income tax expense of 4,897,000 recorded on 17,996,000 of pre-tax income. The effective tax rates are higher than the statutory rates primarily due to state and local taxes as well as non-deductible compensation under the Internal Revenue Code Section 162(m). 

The amount of unrecognized tax benefits at September 29, 2024 was 494,000 all of which would impact the Company s effective tax rate, if recognized. As of September 29, 2024, the Company had approximately 379,000 accrued for the payment of interest and penalties in connection with unrecognized tax benefits. 

Nathan s estimates that its unrecognized tax benefit excluding accrued interest and penalties could be further reduced by up to 46,000 during the fiscal year ending March 30, 2025 due primarily to the lapse of statutes of limitations which would favorably impact the Company s effective tax rate, although no assurances can be given in this regard. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

At September 29, 2024 and September 24, 2023, Nathan s did not have any open purchase commitments for hot dogs. Nathan s may enter into purchase commitments in the future as favorable market conditions become available. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Sources and uses of cash 

Cash and cash equivalents at September 29, 2024 aggregated 31,207,000, a 10,180,000 increase during the fiscal 2025 period as compared to cash of 21,027,000 at March 31, 2024. Net working capital increased to 32,618,000 at September 29, 2024 as compared to 23,203,000 at March 31, 2024. 

Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations. Our primary cash requirements are to fund our quarterly dividends, to satisfy the debt service under our debt instrument, capital expenditures, working capital and general corporate needs. 

On May 1, 2024, we paid our first semi-annual interest payment on the 2025 Notes of 1,987,500 for the fiscal 2025 period. On August 13, 2024, in connection with the redemption of all of the outstanding 60,000,000 principal amount of its 2025 Notes, the Company paid its required interest payment of 1,137,000 on the redeemed 2025 Notes. Subsequent to the quarter ending September 29, 2024, we paid our mandatory debt principal repayment of 600,000 on our Term Loan borrowings under the Credit Agreement. Additionally, on October 10, 2024, we paid interest of 1,042,000 on our Term Loan borrowings and made a voluntary principal prepayment of 8,000,000 on our outstanding Term Loan borrowings. 

On July 2, 2024 and September 6, 2024, we paid our first and second quarterly cash dividends of fiscal 2025 aggregating 4,085,000. We expect to pay our third quarterly dividend on December 6, 2024. 

Cash flow for the fiscal year 2025 will be impacted by various factors, including, as discussed further below in this Liquidity and Capital Resources section, (i) debt issuance costs incurred in connection with our new Credit Agreement, (ii) mandatory debt repayments on our Term Loan borrowings under our new Credit Agreement, (iii) interest payments on our 2025 Notes and our Term Loan borrowings under our new Credit Agreement, (iv) voluntary debt repayments on our Term Loan borrowings and (v) expected dividend payments.

Operating activities 

Cash provided by operations of 14,826,000 in the fiscal 2025 period is primarily attributable to net income of 15,307,000 in addition to other non-cash operating items of 1,278,000, offset by changes in other operating assets and liabilities of 1,759,000. Non-cash operating expenses consist principally of depreciation and amortization of 496,000, amortization of debt issuance costs of 122,000, share-based compensation expense of 417,000, a loss on debt extinguishment of 334,000 and a provision for credit losses of 53,000. In the fiscal 2025 period, accounts and other receivables increased by 994,000 due primarily to higher Branded Product Program receivables of 696,000, and higher receivables due to the Advertising Fund of 933,000 which were offset, in part, by lower franchise and license royalties receivable of 556,000. Prepaid expenses and other current assets decreased by 1,370,000 due principally to a decrease in prepaid income taxes of 858,000, a decrease in prepaid insurance of 174,000 and a decrease in prepaid marketing and other expenses of 324,000. Accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities decreased by 1,912,000 due to a decline in accrued payroll and other benefits of 1,609,000 resulting primarily from the payment of year-end fiscal 2024 incentive compensation; earned deferred revenue of 775,000; and a decline in accrued interest expense of 746,000 resulting primarily from our May 2024 semi-annual interest payment on our 2025 Notes. Offsetting these decreases was an increase in accounts payable due to the timing of seasonal product purchases for our Branded Product Program and Company-owned restaurants. 

Investing activities 

Cash used in investing activities of 130,000 is primarily comprised of capital expenditures incurred for our Branded Product Program and our Coney Island restaurants. 

Financing activities 

In connection with the Company s refinancing of the 2025 Notes, the Company borrowed 60,000,000 in Term Loan borrowings pursuant to the Credit Agreement and simultaneously redeemed the 2025 Notes. We incurred 431,000 of debt issuance costs in connection with this refinancing. Additionally, the Company paid its first and second quarter cash dividends of 0.50 per share totaling 4,085,000. 

Credit Facility 

On July 10, 2024 (the Effective Date ), the Company entered into a five-year unsecured Credit Agreement (the Credit Agreement among the Company, as borrower, direct and indirect subsidiaries of the Company, as guarantors, the lenders from time to time party thereto (the Lenders and Citibank, N.A., as administrative agent, swing line lender, L/C issuer and a Lender. 

The Credit Agreement provides for a term loan facility Term Loan of 60,000,000 and a revolving credit facility Revolving Loan of up to 10,000,000. The Credit Agreement also provides that the Company has the right from time to time during the term of the Credit Agreement to request the Lenders for incremental revolving loan borrowing increases of up to an additional 10,000,000 in the aggregate, subject to, among other items, the Lenders agreeing to lend any such additional amounts and compliance with terms specified in the Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement matures on July 10, 2029. 

The Company borrowed 60,000,000 in Term Loan borrowings on the Effective Date to refinance and redeem its 2025 Notes. The Company will use any Revolving Loan borrowings under the Credit Agreement for working capital and general corporate purposes. See NOTE P LONG TERM DEBT in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information on the Credit Agreement. 

-28-

Share Repurchases 

In 2016, the Board authorized increases to the sixth stock repurchase plan for the purchase of up to 1,200,000 shares of its common stock on behalf of the Company. As of September 29, 2024, Nathan s has repurchased 1,101,884 shares at a cost of 39,000,000 under the sixth stock repurchase plan. At September 29, 2024, there were 98,116 shares remaining to be repurchased pursuant to the sixth stock repurchase plan. The plan does not have a set expiration date. Purchases under the Company s stock repurchase program may be made from time to time, depending on market conditions, in open market or privately negotiated transactions, at prices deemed appropriate by management. There is no set time limit on the repurchases. There were no stock repurchases during the fiscal 2025 period. We may return capital to our stockholders through stock repurchases, subject to any restrictions in our new Credit Agreement, although there is no assurance that the Company will make any repurchases under its existing stock repurchase plan. 

Common Stock Dividends 

As discussed above, we had cash and cash equivalents at September 29, 2024 aggregating 31,207,000. Our Board routinely monitors and assesses its cash position and our current and potential capital requirements. The Company paid its first and second quarterly cash dividends of fiscal 2025 on July 2, 2024 and September 6, 2024 aggregating 4,085,000. 

Effective November 7, 2024, the Company declared its third quarter fiscal 2025 dividend of 0.50 per common share to stockholders of record as of the close of business on November 25, 2024, which is payable on December 6, 2024. 

If the Company pays regular quarterly cash dividends for the remainder of fiscal 2025 at the same rate as declared in the first and second quarter of fiscal 2025, the Company s total cash requirement for dividends for all of fiscal 2025 would be approximately 8,169,000 based on the number of shares of common stock outstanding at November 7, 2024. The Company intends to declare and pay quarterly cash dividends; however, there can be no assurance that any additional quarterly dividends will be declared or paid or of the amount or timing of such dividends, if any. 

Our ability to pay future dividends is limited by the terms of our Credit Agreement. In addition, the payment of any cash dividends in the future are subject to final determination of the Board and will be dependent upon our earnings and financial requirements and the terms of our Credit Agreement. 

Cash Flow Outlook 

We expect that in the future we will make investments in certain existing restaurants, support the growth of the Branded Product and Branded Menu Programs, service the principal and interest obligations under the Credit Agreement, fund our dividend program and may continue our stock repurchase programs, funding those investments from our operating cash flow. We may also incur capital and other expenditures or engage in investing activities in connection with opportunistic situations that may arise on a case-by-case basis. During the fiscal year ending March 30, 2025, we made cash interest payments of 3,125,000 on the 2025 Notes. While our Credit Agreement bears interest at a fluctuating interest rate based on SOFR plus a spread adjustment, if the Company makes its remaining fiscal year 2025 cash interest payments on its outstanding Term Loan borrowings at the interest rate effective at November 7, 2024, then during the fiscal year ended March 30, 2025, we expect to make cash interest payments of approximately 2,400,000 on the Term Loan borrowings. 

We may from time to time seek to make voluntary prepayments of our Credit Agreement. Subsequent to the quarter ending September 29, 2024, on October 10, 2024, we made a voluntary principal prepayment of 8,000,000 of Term Loan borrowings under our Credit Agreement. Such voluntary prepayments, if any, will depend on market conditions, our liquidity requirements, satisfactory compliance of covenants and conditions pursuant to our Credit Agreement and other factors. 

Management believes that available cash and cash equivalents and cash generated from operations should provide sufficient capital to finance our operations, satisfy our debt service requirements, fund dividend distributions and, if any, stock repurchases for at least the next 12 months. 

Contractual Obligations 

At September 29, 2024, we sublet one property to a franchisee that we lease from a third party. We remain contingently liable for all costs associated with this property including rent, property taxes and insurance. We may incur future cash payments with respect to such property, consisting primarily of future lease payments, including costs and expenses associated with terminating such lease. 

-29-

At September 29, 2024, our contractual obligations primarily consist of the Term Loan borrowings under our Credit Agreement and the mandatory debt principal repayments and the related interest payments, operating leases, and employment agreements with certain executive officers. These contractual obligations impact our short-term and long-term liquidity and capital resource needs. See NOTE P LONG TERM DEBT and NOTE Q LEASES in the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1. for additional information. 

Inflationary Impact 

Inflationary pressures on commodity prices, most notably for beef and beef trimmings, have impacted our consolidated results of operations during the fiscal 2025 period, and this trend may continue through the remainder of fiscal year 2025. 

Our average cost of hot dogs during the fiscal 2025 period was approximately 3 higher than during the fiscal 2024 period. Inherent volatility experienced in certain commodity markets, such as those for beef and beef trimmings due to seasonal shifts, climate conditions, industry demand, inflationary pressures and other macroeconomic factors could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. This impact will depend on our ability to manage such volatility through price increases and product mix. We are unable to predict the future cost of our hot dogs and expect to experience price volatility for our beef products during the remainder of fiscal 2025. To the extent that beef prices increase as compared to earlier periods, it could impact our results of operations. In the past, we entered into purchase commitments for a portion of our hot dogs to reduce the impact of increasing market prices. We may attempt to enter into similar purchase arrangements for hot dogs and other products in the future. 

We have experienced competitive pressure on labor rates as a result of the increase in the minimum hourly wage for fast food workers where our Company-owned restaurants are located. On January 1, 2024, the minimum wage increased to 16.00 in New York City, Long Island and Westchester which will be followed by 0.50 annual increases in 2025 and 2026. Further, beginning in 2027, the minimum wage across New York State will increase annually according to the Consumer Price Index. There has also been an increased demand for labor at all levels which has resulted in greater challenges retaining adequate staffing levels at our Company-owned restaurants; our franchised restaurants and Branded Menu Program locations; as well as for certain vendors in our supply chain that we depend on for our commodities. We remain in contact with our major suppliers and to date we have not experienced significant disruptions in our supply chain. 

We believe that these increases in the minimum wage and other changes in employment laws have had a significant financial impact on our financial results and the results of our franchisees that operate in New York State. Our business could be negatively impacted if the decrease in margins for our franchisees results in the potential loss of new franchisees or the closing of a significant number of franchised restaurants. 

We expect to continue experiencing volatility in oil and gas prices on our distribution costs for food products and utility costs in the Company-owned restaurants and volatile insurance costs resulting from the uncertainty of the insurance markets. 

Continued increases in labor costs, commodity prices and other operating expenses, including health care, could adversely affect our operations. We attempt to manage inflationary pressure, and rising commodity costs, at least in part, through raising prices. Delays in implementing price increases, competitive pressures, consumer spending levels and other factors may limit our ability to offset these rising costs. Volatility in commodity prices, including beef and beef trimmings could have a significant adverse effect on our results of operations. 

The Company s business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows can be impacted by a number of factors, including but not limited to those set forth above in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, any one of which could cause our actual results to vary materially from recent results or from our anticipated future results. For a discussion identifying additional risk factors and important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated, also see the discussions in Forward-Looking Statements and Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q and Risk Factors in our Form 10-K for our fiscal year ended March 31, 2024.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 

Cash and Cash Equivalents 

We have historically invested our cash in money market funds or short-term, fixed rate, highly rated and highly liquid instruments which are generally reinvested when they mature. Although these existing investments are not considered at risk with respect to changes in interest rates or markets for these instruments, our rate of return on short-term investments could be affected at the time of reinvestment as a result of intervening events. As of September 29, 2024, Nathan s cash and cash equivalents balance aggregated 31,207,000. Earnings on this cash would increase or decrease by approximately 78,000 per annum for each 0.25 change in interest rates. 

Borrowings 

On July 10, 2024, we entered into the Credit Agreement and borrowed 60,000,000 in Term Loan borrowings to refinance and redeem the 2025 Notes. Borrowings under our Credit Agreement bear interest at a fluctuating interest rate based on SOFR or a base rate plus a spread adjustment. Accordingly, a rising interest rate environment would result in higher interest expense due on borrowings. A hypothetical 100 bps increase in the interest rate on our outstanding unsecured Term Loan borrowings at September 29, 2024 would lead to an increase of approximately 600,000 in cash interest costs over the next twelve months. We currently do not anticipate entering into interest rate swaps or other financial instruments to hedge our borrowings. 

Commodity Costs 

Inflationary pressures on commodity prices have directly impacted our consolidated results of operations during the fiscal 2025 period, most notably within our restaurant operations and Branded Product Program segments. We expect this trend to continue for the remainder of fiscal 2025. Our average cost of hot dogs during the fiscal 2025 period was approximately 3 higher than during the fiscal 2024 period. 

We are unable to predict the future cost of our hot dogs and expect to experience price volatility for our beef products during fiscal 2025. Factors that affect beef prices are outside of our control and include foreign and domestic supply and demand, inflation, weather and seasonality. To the extent that beef prices increase as compared to earlier periods, it could impact our results of operations. In the past, we have entered into purchase commitments for a portion of our hot dogs to reduce the impact of increasing market prices. We may attempt to enter into purchase arrangements for hot dogs and other products in the future. Additionally, we expect to continue experiencing volatility in oil and gas prices on our distribution costs for our food products and utility costs in the Company-owned restaurants and volatile insurance costs resulting from rising rates. 

We have not attempted to hedge against fluctuations in the prices of the commodities we purchase using future, forward, option or other instruments. As a result, we expect that the majority of our future commodity purchases will be subject to market changes in the prices of such commodities. We have attempted to enter sales agreements with our Branded Product Program customers that are correlated to our cost of beef, thus reducing our market volatility, or have passed through permanent increases in our commodity prices to our Branded Product Program customers that are not on formula pricing, thereby reducing the impact of long-term increases on our financial results. A short-term increase or decrease of 10 in the cost of our food and paper products for the period ended September 29, 2024 would have increased or decreased our cost of sales by approximately 4,741,000. 

Foreign Currencies 

Foreign franchisees generally conduct business with us and make payments in United States dollars, reducing the risks inherent with changes in the values of foreign currencies. As a result, we have not purchased future contracts, options or other instruments to hedge against changes in values of foreign currencies and we do not believe fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies would have a material impact on our financial results. 

-31-

Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as required by Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e) and Exchange Act Rule 15d-15(e). Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the SEC s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Changes in Internal Controls 

There were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended September 29, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls 

We believe that a control system, no matter how well designed and operated, cannot provide absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met, and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within a company have been detected. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that such controls and procedures are effective at the reasonable assurance level.
