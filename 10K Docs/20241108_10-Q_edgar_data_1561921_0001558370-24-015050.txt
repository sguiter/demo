In addition to historical financial information, some of the information contained in the following discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ). All statements other than statements of historical facts, including statements regarding our future results of operations and financial position, business strategy, current and prospective products, product approvals, research and development costs, current and prospective collaborations, timing and likelihood of success, plans and objectives of management for future operations and future results of current and anticipated products, are forward-looking statements. These statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties, assumptions and other important factors that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. Overview We are a commercial-stage medical technology company focused on providing innovative soft-tissue reconstruction solutions that optimize clinical outcomes by prioritizing the preservation and restoration of the patient s own anatomy. Our growing product portfolio is purposefully designed to leverage the patient s natural healing response while minimizing long-term exposure to permanent synthetic materials. We are committed to delivering our advanced technologies with a strong economic value proposition to assist surgeons and institutions in providing next-generation soft-tissue repair solutions to more patients worldwide. We are dedicated to building true partnerships with surgeons and healthcare providers to deliver solutions that provide both clinical and economic improvements. We believe that genuine collaboration with surgeons and healthcare providers results in the development of new solutions that empower patient care. Our first portfolio of products, the OviTex Reinforced Tissue Matrix OviTex which we first commercialized in the U.S. in July 2016 and in Europe in February 2019, addresses unmet needs in hernia repair and abdominal wall reconstruction by combining the benefits of biologic matrices and polymer materials while minimizing their shortcomings, at a cost-effective price. Hernia repair is one of the most common surgeries performed in the U.S., representing approximately 1.1 million procedures annually. Based on the volume weighted average selling price of our OviTex products, we estimate the annual U.S. total addressable market opportunity for our OviTex products to be approximately 1.5 billion. Our OviTex portfolio consists of multiple product configurations intended to address various surgical procedures within hernia repair and abdominal wall reconstruction, including ventral, inguinal, and hiatal hernia repair. In addition, we have also designed an OviTex product specifically for use in laparoscopic and robotic-assisted hernia repair, which we market as OviTex LPR and began commercializing this product in November 2018. In February 2023, we launched two larger configurations of OviTex LPR, designed for ventral and incisional hernias. In April 2024, we launched OviTex IHR Reinforced Tissue Matrix, a new OviTex configuration specifically designed to address inguinal hernia procedures performed robotically and laparoscopically. We have also focused on evaluating and publishing clinical data on the effectiveness and safety of our OviTex products. To date, there have been over thirty published or presented works relating to these clinical findings, either by us or a third-party evaluating the OviTex product. In October 2022, the 24-month results of our single arm, multicenter post-market clinical study, which we refer to as our BRAVO study, were published in the Annals of Medicine and

 Surgery . The BRAVO study was designed to evaluate the clinical performance of OviTex for primary or recurrent ventral hernias using open, laparoscopic, or robotic techniques in 92 enrolled patients. The recurrence rate at the 24-month time point was 2.6 , and surgical site occurrences, or SSOs, were observed in 38 of the study population. Of the enrolled patients, 78 were characterized as high risk for experiencing an SSO based on at least one known risk factor, which included obesity, active smoking, COPD, diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, or advanced age 75 years). The results also indicated that BRAVO patients experienced statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvements in their quality of life and perceived health based on patient responses to the EuroQol-5 Dimension (EQ-5D) health assessment and the validated 12-question Hernia-Related Quality of Life survey (HerQLes). In addition to the BRAVO study and other current clinical initiatives, we also commenced enrollment in May 2021 for our BRAVO II study, a prospective study evaluating the use of OviTex in robot-assisted ventral and inguinal hernia repairs. Our second portfolio of products, the OviTex PRS Reinforced Tissue Matrix, OviTex PRS which we first commercialized in the U.S. in May 2019, addresses unmet needs in plastic and reconstructive surgery. OviTex PRS is indicated for use in implantation to reinforce soft-tissue where weakness exists in patients requiring soft-tissue repair or reinforcement in plastic and reconstructive surgery. Our OviTex PRS portfolio consists of three product configurations with two or three layers of high-quality tissue derived from ovine rumen, which is reinforced with either permanent or resorbable polymer for added strength, stabilization, and controlled stretch. These products are designed to improve outcomes by facilitating functional tissue remodeling while controlling the degree and direction of stretch. In August 2023, we announced the launch of our OviTex PRS Long-Term Resorbable product configuration, which was designed to enhance the OviTex PRS portfolio with specific design features including bi-directional stretch and a fully resorbable, long-term polymer for reinforcement. Our OviTex PRS portfolio is supported by non-human primate data that demonstrated more rapid tissue integration and tissue remodeling compared to the market leading biologic matrix used in this indication. Based on the current sales of biologic matrices in the U.S., we estimate the annual U.S. current addressable market opportunity for our OviTex PRS products to be approximately 700 million. Our OviTex products have received 510(k) clearances from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, FDA which clearances were obtained and are currently held by our exclusive contract manufacturer of these products, Aroa. In April 2019, our first OviTex PRS products received 510(k) clearance from the FDA, which clearance was initially obtained by Aroa and is currently held by us. In March 2023, we received an additional 510(k) clearance for our OviTex PRS Long-Term Resorbable device, which is currently held by us. In May 2024, we received clearance of a Special 510(k) related to minor changes to our OviTex PRS Permanent and Short-Term Resorbable devices. In October 2024, we received approval from the FDA for our investigational device exemption application relating to the study of the safety and effectiveness of our OviTex PRS product in implant-based breast reconstruction. We continue to evaluate and finalize the clinical study protocol and anticipate additional FDA interactions related to such to support a pre-market application to obtain an indication for OviTex PRS for use in breast reconstruction. We also continue to expand our service offerings and diversify our supplier base as we continue to create a soft tissue preservation and restoration portfolio, including through the development of complimentary solutions in our indications such as atraumatic mesh fixation devices or surgical wound management and infection control. In September 2023, we entered into a distribution agreement with Advanced Medical Solutions Limited, a company registered in England, to distribute their LiquiFix Hernia Mesh Fixation Devices (LiquiFix FIX8 and LiquiFix Precision ). In March 2024, we announced the full commercial launch of LiquiFix in the U.S. We previously co-developed and commercialized our NIVIS Fibrillar Collagen Pack, NIVIS an absorbent matrix of Type I and Type III bovine collagen designed to manage moderately to heavily exudating wounds and to control minor bleeding, in partnership with Regenity Biosciences. In March 2024, we sold our distribution rights to MiMedx Group, Inc. in exchange for an initial 5.0 million payment and additional future payments aggregating between a minimum of 3.0 million and a maximum of 7.0 million based on net sales of NIVIS during the first two years following its launch by MiMedx Group, Inc. We continue to assess additional strategic partnerships with medical device companies whereby we may enter into distribution, product development and/or licensing agreements for new products complimentary to, or related to, existing and future products in our distribution channel.

 We have a broad portfolio of intellectual property protecting our products that we believe, when combined with the proprietary manufacturing processes associated with our products and our know-how, provides significant barriers to entry. Our intellectual property applies to our differentiated product construction and materials. In addition, we believe our exclusive manufacturing and long-term supply and license agreement with Aroa creates a competitive advantage by allowing us to secure an exclusive supply of ovine rumen at a low cost. Ovine rumen, the forestomach of a sheep, is the source of the biologic material used in our OviTex and OviTex PRS products. We use biologic material from ovine rumen because of its plentiful supply, optimal biomechanical profile and open collagen architecture that allows for rapid cellular infiltration. Our OviTex products are manufactured by Aroa at their FDA registered and ISO 13485 compliant facility in Auckland, New Zealand. We purchase product from Aroa at a fixed transfer cost as a percentage of Aroa s cost of goods sold, and, with the exception of our recent IHR-dedicated products, equals 27 of our net sales of licensed products. This revenue sharing arrangement allows us to competitively price our products and pass along cost-savings to our customers. We market our products through a single direct sales force, predominantly in the U.S., as augmented by a smaller number of sales representatives and distributors in certain European countries. We have invested in our direct sales and marketing infrastructure to expand our presence and to promote awareness and adoption of our products. As of September 30, 2024, we had 75 sales territories in the U.S. We believe we can enhance the productivity of our sales force by improving customer segmentation and targeting, implementing and further refining our proprietary training programs, leveraging support from our medical education and medical affairs functions to drive physician awareness, education and clinical understanding of our products, and utilizing engagement analytics to support further product development and enhancement opportunities. Additionally, we have contracted with three national group purchasing organizations, GPOs covering our OviTex and OviTex PRS products and plan to continue to contract with additional GPOs and other integrated delivery networks IDNs to increase access to and penetration of hospital accounts. We are currently devoting research and development resources to develop additional variations of our OviTex and OviTex PRS product lines, including larger versions of our current product configurations, the development of configurations with longer-acting resorbable polymers and other potential product and packaging enhancements to extend the shelf life of our products. In addition, we also continue to explore the development of lower-cost, higher-margin resorbable polymer-based devices targeting our current indications. We are also exploring additional technologies that may complement our existing products, or expand the number of our product lines, in each case within the hernia, plastic and reconstruction, and broader soft-tissue reconstruction and preservation markets. We intend to continue to make investments in research and development efforts to develop improvements and enhancements to our product portfolio. We are also assessing strategic partnerships with medical device companies whereby we may enter into distribution, product development and/or licensing agreements for products complimentary to, or related to, existing and future products in our distribution channel, which could result in the payment by us of single digit percentage royalties or other product acquisition costs. The vast majority of our revenue to date has been generated by the sale of our OviTex products. Our revenue increased by 3.9 million, or 26 , from 15.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 19.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and by 10.2 million, or 25 , from 41.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 51.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Our net loss decreased by 0.6 million, or 5 , from 11.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 10.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024. Our net loss decreased by 5.1 million, or 15 , from 33.8 million to 28.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 due to the gain on sale of NIVIS. We have not been profitable since inception and as of September 30, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of 349.5 million. Starting in the third quarter of 2024, we implemented certain cost-cutting measures which are expected to result in reduced operating expenses in future periods. However, we expect to incur losses for the foreseeable future. Business Update Regarding Macroeconomic Conditions and COVID-19 Our business, results of operations and commercial operations have been impacted by macroeconomic conditions, including the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as, to a lesser extent, inflationary pressures, fluctuations in foreign currency 

 20 

Table of Contents 
 in the jurisdictions in which we operate, banking instability, monetary policy changes and geopolitical conflicts. These factors have and may continue to impact us in the following ways: COVID-19 : Our business was directly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, including due to government restrictions on elective procedures and surgical staffing challenges that lead to the deferral of elective surgeries and lower surgical procedural volumes overall. We believe that surgical procedures have started to normalize to pre-pandemic levels and that hospital systems have begun to address any remaining backlog of procedures previously delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the true economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic may have created other labor and financial strains on healthcare systems that continue to reduce procedural volumes. General Economic Uncertainty : Continued concerns about the systemic impact of a potential economic downturn or recession, increasing interest rates, further economic downturn or banking instability, monetary policy changes and geopolitical issues, including the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict, the current conflict in Israel and Gaza (including any escalation or expansion) and increasing tensions between China and Taiwan, have contributed to increased market volatility and diminished expectations for economic growth in the world. Due to this uncertainty and other factors, we have experienced high volatility in our stock price over the prior year. Continued uncertainty, perception of worsening market conditions and the introduction of new products which may, or may be perceived to, negatively impact the demand for our products now or in the future could result in a decline in our stock price, high inflation, an increase in our cost of capital and an adverse effect on our ability to access the capital markets in the future on terms acceptable to us or at all. External Cybersecurity Events : The sale of our medical products is correlated to the frequency of surgical procedural volumes at current and prospective hospital accounts. During the second quarter of 2024, we became aware of multiple cybersecurity events, including ransomware attacks and other similar system disruptions and outages, in the U.S. and Europe that adversely impacted the procedural volumes at current customer accounts, including those affiliated across one of our GPOs. To the extent current or future cybersecurity events continue to impact the hospital systems we serve, or otherwise affect third-party payors or other vendors within the healthcare industry critical to the patient care, we may experience additional reductions in procedural volumes that lead to lower sales volume for our products. External Supply Constraints for Critical Surgical Supplies : Any disruptions to the supply of critical surgical supplies, including, for example, IV fluids, could lead to deferrals of elective surgical procedures, including those utilizing our products. To the extent that our current and prospective hospital customers experience significant shortages of these critical supplies, whether due to extreme weather events, labor or work stoppages, or other supply chain disruptions, we may experience reductions in procedural volumes that lead to lower sales volume for our products. Financial Strain : Market acceptance of our medical products in the U.S. and other countries is dependent upon the procurement practices of our customers, patient need for our products and procedures and the reimbursement of patients medical expenses by government healthcare programs and third-party payors. The continuing uncertainty surrounding macroeconomic conditions and financial markets, including the financial strain suffered by hospital customers during the COVID-19 pandemic, may adversely affect demand for our products and procedures and result in lower reimbursement rates or coverage for our products, resulting in lower sales volume and downward pricing pressure on our products and slower adoption of new products. Components of Our Results of Operations Revenue The majority of our revenue consists of direct sales of our products to hospital accounts in the U.S. Depending on the terms of our agreements with our customers, we recognize revenue related to product sales when control transfers, which generally occurs when the product is shipped to the customer, or when the product is utilized in a surgical procedure in the case of consignment agreements. Fees charged to customers for shipping are recognized as revenue. Recent revenue growth has been driven by increasing revenue from product sales due to our expanding customer base, although macroeconomic pressures described in this Quarterly Report may impair our ability to continue to generate revenue and expand our customer base at historic rates.

 Cost of Revenue Cost of revenue primarily consists of the costs of licensed products, charges related to excess and obsolete inventory adjustments, royalties and costs related to shipping. We purchase product from Aroa at a fixed transfer cost as a percentage of Aroa s cost of goods, which, with the exception of our recent IHR-dedicated products, equals 27 of our net sales of licensed products. The initial term of our Aroa License terminates on the expiration of the last patent covering bovine and ovine products, with an option to extend for an additional ten-year period. We expect our cost of revenue to increase in absolute dollars as, and to the extent, our sales volume grows. Any delay in volume growth, whether due to macroeconomic pressures or otherwise, could lead to additional charges to excess and obsolete inventory. Amortization of Intangible Assets Amortization of intangible assets relates to the amortization of capitalized milestone amounts paid to Aroa related to license fees or commercialization rights after future economic benefit has been established for a product. These capitalized milestone amounts relate to regulatory clearances, the receipt of certain supply quantities of product, and amounts based upon aggregate net sales thresholds within a specified territory, and are amortized over the remaining useful life of the intellectual property. Gross Profit and Gross Margin Our gross profit is calculated by subtracting our cost of revenue and amortization of intangible assets from our revenue. We calculate our gross margin percentage as our gross profit divided by our revenue. Our gross margin has been, and we expect it will continue to be, affected by a variety of factors, including sales volume, royalties and inventory excess and obsolescence costs. Our gross profit may increase to the extent our revenue grows. Sales and Marketing Expenses Sales and marketing expenses consist of commercial activities related to the sale of our products, along with the salaries and related benefits, including sales commissions and stock-based compensation for employees focused on these efforts. Other significant sales and marketing expenses include costs incurred with post-market clinical studies, conferences and trade shows, promotional and marketing activities, market research, as well as travel and training expenses. We expect future sales and marketing expenses will primarily depend on our ability to drive operational leverage and efficiencies from our expanded commercial organization. We expect our sales and marketing expenses to continue to decrease as a percentage of revenue, as and to the extent, our revenue grows. General and Administrative Expenses General and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related benefits, including stock-based compensation for personnel in executive, finance, information technology and administrative functions. General and administrative expenses also include professional service fees for legal, accounting, consulting, investor and public relations, insurance costs and direct and allocated facility-related costs. We expect future general and administrative expenses will primarily depend on our ability to efficiently execute on our growth initiatives. We expect our general and administrative expenses to decrease as a percentage of revenue primarily as, and to the extent, our revenue grows. Research and Development Expenses Research and development expenses consist primarily of product research, engineering, product development, regulatory compliance and clinical development. These expenses include salaries and related benefits including stock-based compensation, for employees focused on these efforts, consulting services, costs associated with our preclinical studies, costs incurred with our manufacturing partner under development agreements related to technology transfer, costs incurred from license agreements with no alternative future uses, laboratory materials and supplies and an allocation of related facilities costs. We expense research and development costs as they are incurred.

Table of Contents 
 We expect future research and development expenses will primarily depend on our ability to efficiently develop new products, enhance existing products and conduct research to generate clinical data in support of new or expanded indications for our products. We expect research and development expenses as a percentage of revenue to vary over time depending on the level and timing of new product development and clinical trial initiatives. Gain on Sale of Product Line In March 2024, we entered into an asset purchase agreement with MiMedx Group, Inc. to sell certain assets related to NIVIS. These assets mainly included our existing inventory of NIVIS, with a net carrying value of 0.8 million, and certain intellectual property rights to sell NIVIS, with no carrying value. We transferred control of the nonfinancial asset group in March 2024 and recognized a gain of 7.6 million on the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. At each reporting date, we assess the constraint of variable consideration and record increases in the transaction price in the period that the estimate of variable consideration changes. Interest Expense Interest expense consists of cash interest under our credit facilities and non-cash interest attributable to the amortization of final payment fees and the amortization of deferred financing costs related to our indebtedness. Other Income Other income consists primarily of income earned on our cash and cash equivalents offset by miscellaneous tax expenses and foreign currency exchange gains and losses.

 increased. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we sold 4,767 units of OviTex as compared to 3,426 units of OviTex during the three months ended September 30, 2023, a 39 increase in unit sales volume. Additionally, we sold 1,293 units of OviTex PRS during the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 896 units during the three months ended September 30, 2023, a 44 increase in unit sales volume. Cost of Revenue Cost of revenue (excluding amortization of intangible assets) increased by 1.4 million, or 31 , to 6.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 4.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in cost of revenue was primarily the result of an increase in products purchased to support demand from our higher unit sales and a higher charge for excess and obsolete inventory. Amortization of Intangible Assets Amortization of intangible assets was 95,000 for both the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Gross Margin Gross margin decreased to 68 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 69 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to a higher charge for excess and obsolete inventory as a percentage of revenue. Sales and Marketing Sales and marketing expenses increased by 2.0 million, or 14 , to 16.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 14.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to higher compensation costs, including increased severance costs, and additional consulting and travel expenses. General and Administrative General and administrative expenses were 3.7 million for both the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The slight decrease was due to lower insurance expense, professional fees and compensation and benefits which offset higher software-related costs and banking fees. Research and Development Research and development expenses decreased by 0.3 million, or 13 , to 2.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 2.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to lower study and development costs which offset higher compensation and benefits. Interest Expense Interest expense was 1.3 million for both the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Other Income Other income decreased by 0.2 million, or 40 , to 0.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 0.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to lower interest income as a result of lower cash balances.

The increase in revenue was primarily driven by an increase in unit sales of our products due to our expanded commercial organization, which resulted in the addition of new customers and growing international sales. This growth was partially offset by a decrease in average selling prices caused by product mix as the share of smaller-sized units increased. In addition, we estimate that additional forecasted revenue was negatively impacted as a result of two external cybersecurity events, each of which reduced surgeries at certain facilities during the second quarter of 2024. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we sold 13,034 units of OviTex as compared to 9,704 units of OviTex during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, a 34 increase in unit sales volume. Additionally, we sold 3,467 units of OviTex PRS during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 2,484 units during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, a 40 increase in unit sales volume. Cost of Revenue Cost of revenue (excluding amortization of intangible assets) increased by 3.4 million, or 27 , to 16.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 12.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in cost of revenue was primarily the result of an increase in products purchased to support demand from our higher unit sales and a higher charge for excess and obsolete inventory.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources Overview As of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of 17.3 million, working capital of 27.3 million and an accumulated deficit of 349.5 million. As of December 31, 2023, we had cash and cash equivalents of 46.7 million, working capital of 54.8 million and an accumulated deficit of 320.9 million. In March 2024, we sold our distribution rights for NIVIS to MiMedx Group, Inc. in exchange for an initial 5.0 million payment and additional future payments aggregating between a minimum of 3.0 million and a maximum of 7.0 million based on net sales of NIVIS during the first two years following its launch by MiMedx Group, Inc. Subsequent to September 30, 2024, we completed an underwritten public offering of 14,670,000 shares of our common stock, including the exercise in full of the underwriters option to purchase additional shares, at a price to the public of 2.25 per share and, in lieu of common stock to investors who so chose, pre-funded warrants to purchase 5,800,000 shares of common stock at a public offering price of 2.2499 per pre-funded warrant, which represents the per share public offering price for the shares of common stock less the 0.0001 per share exercise price for each pre-funded warrant. The offering resulted in gross proceeds of 46.0 million, before deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other estimated offering expenses and assuming no exercise of the pre-funded warrants. The exercise of the pre-funded warrants, if any, is not expected to provide significant additional funding to us. We have incurred operating losses since our inception, and we anticipate that our operating losses will continue in the near term as we seek to invest in our sales and marketing initiatives to support our growth in existing and new markets and in additional research and development activities. As of September 30, 2024, we had 40.0 million of borrowings outstanding under our Credit and Security Agreement (the MidCap Credit Agreement with MidCap Financial Trust, as agent and certain lender parties thereto. The MidCap Credit Agreement matures in May 2027. Upon closing, we used a portion of the proceeds to repay borrowings under a previous credit facility and intend to use the remaining proceeds to fund operations and other general corporate purposes. Based on our current business plan, we believe that our existing cash resources, inclusive of the proceeds received in the underwritten public offering described above, will be sufficient to meet our capital requirements and fund our operations for at least the next 12 months from the issuance of this Quarterly Report. Cash used in operating activities during the remaining interim period of 2024 is expected to decrease primarily due to the combination of our forecasted growth in revenue and constraint of operating spend, however, we can provide no assurance that our expectations will be achieved. Starting in the third quarter of 2024, we implemented certain cost-cutting measures which are expected to result in reduced operating expenses in future periods. To the extent that these sources are insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements, despite our recent cost-cutting measures, we may seek to sell common or preferred equity or debt securities or enter into a new credit facility. In November 2023, we entered into a new Equity Distribution Agreement (the 2023 Equity Agreement with Piper Sandler Co. Piper in connection with the establishment of an at-the-market offering program under which we may sell shares of our common stock, from time to time through Piper as sales agent, in an initial amount of up to 50.0 million. No sales were made under the 2023 Equity Agreement during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. If we raise additional funds by issuing equity or equity-linked securities, our stockholders would experience dilution and any new equity securities could have rights, preferences and privileges superior to those of holders of our common stock. Debt financing, if available, may involve covenants restricting our operations or our ability to incur additional debt. We cannot be assured that additional equity, equity-linked or debt financing will be available on terms favorable to us or our stockholders, or at all, including as a result of market volatility stemming from macroeconomic conditions, including those related to banking instability, monetary policy changes, increasing interest rates or other factors. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing, when needed, we may be required to delay or reduce the current development, commercialization and marketing plans for our products.

 Cash Flows The following table summarizes our sources and uses of cash for each of the periods presented: 

Nine months ended September 30, (in thousands) 2024 2023 Cash used in operating activities (34,064) (29,806) Cash provided by (used in) investing activities 4,641 (406) Cash provided by financing activities 149 46,245 Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents (154) 150 Net (decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash (29,428) 16,183 Operating Activities During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we used 34.1 million of cash in operating activities, resulting from our net loss of 28.6 million, non-cash items of 1.6 million and the change in operating assets and liabilities of 3.8 million. Our non-cash items were comprised of the gain on sale of NIVIS of 7.6 million offset by stock-based compensation expense of 3.3 million, our excess and obsolete inventory charge of 1.6 million, depreciation and amortization expense of 0.7 million and noncash interest expense of 0.5 million. The change in our operating assets and liabilities was primarily related to changes in inventory and accounts receivable partially offset by increases in accounts payable. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we used 29.8 million of cash in operating activities, resulting from our net loss of 33.8 million and the change in operating assets and liabilities of 1.9 million, offset by non-cash items of 5.8 million. Our non-cash items were comprised of stock-based compensation expense of 3.8 million, our excess and obsolete inventory charge of 1.0 million, depreciation and amortization expense of 0.6 million and noncash interest expense of 0.4 million. The change in our operating assets and liabilities was primarily related to increases in accounts receivable and inventory partially offset by increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses and other current and long-term liabilities. Investing Activities During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, cash provided by investing activities was 4.6 million consisting of proceeds received from the sale of NIVIS of 5.4 million offset by 0.7 million in purchases of property and equipment. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, cash used in investing activities was 0.4 million consisting of purchases of property and equipment. Financing Activities During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, cash provided by financing activities was 0.1 million, consisting primarily of proceeds received from the exercise of stock options and from the issuance of common stock under the employee stock purchase plan partially offset by the payment of withholding taxes related to stock-based compensation to employees. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, cash provided by financing activities was 46.2 million, consisting primarily of 46.3 million in proceeds received from the sale of our common stock partially offset by the payment of withholding taxes related to stock-based compensation to employees. Ind ebte dness On May 26, 2022, we entered into the MidCap Credit Agreement with MidCap Financial Trust, as agent and certain lender parties thereto. The MidCap Credit Agreement consists of 40.0 million in a term loan. Upon closing, we used a 

 28 

Table of Contents 
 portion of the proceeds to repay borrowings under a previous credit facility and intend to use the remaining proceeds to fund operations and other general corporate purposes. Pursuant to the MidCap Credit Agreement, we provided a first priority security interest in all existing and future acquired assets, including intellectual property, owned by us. The MidCap Credit Agreement contains certain covenants that limit our ability to engage in certain transactions that may be in our long-term best interests, including the incurrence of additional indebtedness, effecting certain corporate changes, making certain investments, acquisitions or dispositions and paying dividends. The MidCap Credit Agreement also contains customary indemnification obligations and customary events of default, including, among other things, (i) non-payment, (ii) breach of warranty, (iii) non-performance of covenants and obligations, (iv) default on other indebtedness, (v) judgments, (vi) change of control, (vii) bankruptcy and insolvency, (viii) impairment of security, (ix) key permit events, (x) termination of a pension plan, (xi) regulatory matters, (xii) material adverse effect and (xiii) breach of material contracts. In addition, we must maintain minimum net revenue levels tested quarterly. In the event of default under the MidCap Credit Agreement, we would be required to pay interest on principal and all other due and unpaid obligations at the current rate in effect plus 2 . The MidCap term loan matures on May 1, 2027 and bears interest at a rate equal to 6.25 plus the greater of one-month Term SOFR (as defined in the MidCap Credit Agreement) or 1.0 . We are required to make 36 monthly interest payments beginning on June 1, 2022 (the Interest-Only Period ). If we are in covenant compliance at the end of the Interest-Only Period, we will have the option to extend the Interest-Only Period by 12 months to 48 monthly interest payments, followed by 12 months of straight-line amortization, with the entire principal payment due at maturity. If we are not in covenant compliance at the end of the Interest-Only Period, we are required to make 24 months of straight-line amortization payments, with the entire principal amount due at maturity. Subject to certain limitations, the MidCap term loan has a prepayment fee equal to 3.0 of the prepaid principal amount for the first year following the closing date of the MidCap term loan, 2.0 of the prepaid principal amount for the second year following the closing date and 1.0 of the prepaid principal amount for the third year following the closing date and thereafter. We are also required to pay an exit fee at the time of maturity or prepayment event equal to 5 of all principal borrowings (or in the event of a prepayment event, the amount of principal being prepaid). Contractual Obligations and Commitments As of September 30, 2024, there were no significant changes to our commitments and future minimum contractual obligations as set forth in our Annual Report. Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates The Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates included in our Annual Report have not materially changed. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We did not have during the periods presented, and we do not currently have, any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in the rules and regulations of the SEC. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Our cash is held on deposit in demand accounts at high-credit-quality financial institutions in amounts in excess of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation FDIC insurance coverage limit of 250,000 per depositor, per FDIC-insured bank, per ownership category. Following the events relating to Silicon Valley Bank in 2023, we established a redundant account at a high-credit-quality financial institution to mitigate liquidity risk to our cash and cash equivalents from any 

 29 

Table of Contents 
 further instability in the financial industry. We have reviewed the consolidated financial statements of these financial institutions and believe they have sufficient assets and liquidity to conduct their operations in the ordinary course of business with little or no credit risk to us. Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk principally consist of cash equivalents and accounts receivable. We limit our credit risk associated with cash equivalents by placing investments in highly-rated money market funds. We limit our credit risk with respect to accounts receivable by performing credit evaluations when deemed necessary, but we do not require collateral to secure amounts owed to us by our customers. As discussed above in the section of this Quarterly Report entitled Liquidity and Capital Resources Indebtedness, the MidCap Credit Facility bears interest at a floating rate of interest, which resets monthly and is equal to 6.25 plus the greater of one-month Term SOFR or 1.0 . As a result, we are exposed to risks from changes in interest rates. A 1 increase in interest rates would have resulted in a 0.3 million increase to our interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Inflationary factors, such as increases in our cost of revenue and operating expenses, may adversely affect our operating results. Although we do not believe inflation has had a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows to date, a high rate of inflation in the future may have an adverse effect on our ability to maintain and increase our gross margin or decrease our operating expenses as a percentage of our revenue if our selling prices of our products do not increase as much or more than our costs increase. We do not currently have any material exposure to foreign currency fluctuations and do not engage in any hedging activities as part of our normal course of business. Item 4. Controls and Procedures. Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Our management, with the participation and supervision of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer, have evaluated our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report, our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by Rule 13a-15(d) and 15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act that occurred during the period covered by this Quarterly Report that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
