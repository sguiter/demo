 All debt without a stated maturity date is considered current and is reflected as maturing in the earliest period shown in the table above. See Note 5 Fair Value Measurements for discussion of the fair value measurement of our debt. 
 Other Debt 
 As of September 30, 2024, other debt includes million for a note due in 2026 related to an acquisition of a venue in the United States during the first quarter of 2023 and million for a Euro-denominated note due in 2024 related to a venue located in Europe. 
 million from our senior secured revolving credit facility, and on November 1, 2024, we used these funds to repay the million principal amount plus accrued interest on our senior notes. As a result of this drawdown, the senior notes were classified as long-term debt as of September 30, 2024 due to utilizing our revolving credit facility for the payment which has a maturity date in 2029, as amended below. 
 On November 5, 2024, we amended our senior secured credit facility and entered into Amendment No. 12 (the Amendment to our Credit Agreement, dated as of May 6, 2010 (as amended, restated, supplemented or modified prior to Amendment No. 12, the Credit Agreement and as amended by Amendment No. 12, the Amended Credit Agreement ). The Amendment added a venue expansion revolving credit facility of million, which resulted in a total available borrowing capacity of billion. 
 The Amended Credit Agreement contains a financial covenant that requires the Company to maintain a maximum ratio of consolidated net debt to consolidated EBITDA (both as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement) that ranges from x to x, with the first step down of x occurring on March 31, 2026 and additional step downs of x occurring annually thereafter. 
 The new revolving credit facility matures on November 5, 2029, provided, that if (x) any of the term B loans, the Company s 2027 senior secured notes, or the Company s 2027 senior unsecured notes remain outstanding on the date that is ninety-one days prior to the stated maturity thereof in an aggregate principal amount in excess of million and (y) the Company s consolidated free cash on such date is less than the sum of such outstanding principal amount plus million, then the maturity date of the new revolving credit facility will instead be such date.

 NOTE 5 
 Interest rate swaps 
 
 Cash equivalents consist of money market funds. Fair values for cash equivalents are based on quoted prices in an active market. The fair value for our interest rate swaps are based upon inputs corroborated by observable market data with similar tenors. 
 Our outstanding debt held by third-party financial institutions is carried at cost, adjusted for any discounts or debt issuance costs. Our debt is not publicly traded and the carrying amounts typically approximate fair value for debt that accrues interest at a variable rate, which are considered to be Level 2 inputs as defined in the FASB guidance. 
 3.75 Senior Secured Notes due 2028 4.875 Senior Notes due 2024 5.625 Senior Notes due 2026 4.75 Senior Notes due 2027 2.0 Convertible Senior Notes due 2025 3.125 Convertible Senior Notes due 2029 
 The estimated fair value of our third-party fixed-rate debt is based on quoted market prices in active markets for the same or similar debt, which are considered to be Level 2 inputs. 
 Non-recurring 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded a gain related to an investment in a nonconsolidated affiliate of million, as well as, a gain related to a warrant in a nonconsolidated affiliate of million, as a component of other income, net. To calculate the gain on the investment, we remeasured the investment to fair value of million using an observable price from orderly transactions for a similar investment of the same issuer. We remeasured the warrant to fair value of million using an option pricing model. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we also recorded a gain related to an investment in a nonconsolidated affiliate of million, as a component of other income, net. The gain was related to the acquisition of a controlling interest in a concert business, which was previously accounted for as an equity-method investment. To calculate the gain, we remeasured the investment to fair value of million using the income approach method. 
 The key inputs in these fair value measurements include a future cash flow projection, including revenue, profit margins, and adjustment related to discount for lack of marketability. The key inputs used for these non-recurring fair value measurements are considered Level 3 inputs. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, there were no significant non-recurring fair value measurements.

 NOTE 6 
 members of the audience sustained fatal injuries and others suffered non-fatal injuries. Following these events, at least civil lawsuits have been filed against Live Nation Entertainment, Inc. and related entities, asserting insufficient crowd control and other theories, seeking compensatory and punitive damages. Pursuant to a February 2022 order of the state Multidistrict Litigation Panel, matter 21-1033, the civil cases have been assigned to Judge Kristen Hawkins of the 11th District Court of Harris County, Texas, for oversight of pretrial matters under Texas s rules governing multidistrict litigation. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, all remaining wrongful death lawsuits were settled, and we began settlement discussions in earnest with certain remaining parties with injury claims. As a result, we have recognized million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 within selling, general and administrative expenses for the estimated probable losses in excess of our expected insurance recoveries. The amounts recorded as of September 30, 2024 represent our best estimate of the ultimate loss associated with all remaining lawsuits and claims. 
 Our assessment of loss, which resulted from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties, is based on estimates and assumptions that have been deemed reasonable by management, but that may prove to be incomplete or inaccurate, and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that might cause us to change those estimates and assumptions or recognize additional losses. 
 Department of Justice Complaint 
 In May 2024, the United States Department of Justice, Antitrust Division, together with the attorneys general of twenty-nine states plus the District of Columbia, filed a civil antitrust complaint (the Complaint against Live Nation Entertainment, Inc. and Ticketmaster in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York alleging violations of various federal and state laws pertaining to antitrust, competition, unlawful or unfair business practices, restraint of trade, and other causes of action. The Complaint requests various forms of relief for the alleged violations, including without limitation the divestiture of Ticketmaster by the Company, cancellation of certain ticketing contracts, enjoining the Company from engaging in anticompetitive practices, and other forms of relief. Certain states also seek unspecified damages for their citizens. The Company believes it has substantial defenses to the lawsuit and will vigorously defend itself. 
 The United States filed an Amended Complaint in August 2024, adding ten additional states as plaintiffs but not otherwise materially amending the claims asserted in the lawsuit. The Company filed a motion to dismiss certain claims in the Amended Complaint in September 2024. 
 Antitrust Litigation 
 The Company is a defendant in putative antitrust consumer class actions alleging violations of federal and state antitrust laws, among other causes of action. In Heckman, et al. v. Live Nation Entertainment, et al. , filed in the Central District of California in January 2022, the District Court denied defendants motion to compel arbitration in August 2023. The Ninth Circuit subsequently affirmed the District Court s ruling in October 2024. The Company believes it has substantial defenses to the claims alleged in the lawsuit and will continue to vigorously defend itself. 
 other putative class actions were filed in the Southern District of New York in August and September 2024: In Re Live Nation Entertainment, Inc. and Ticketmaster L.L.C. Antitrust Litigation, and Jacobson v. Live Nation Entertainment, Inc., et al . While these lawsuits are at their initial stages, the Company believes it has substantial defenses to the claims alleged therein and will vigorously defend itself. 
 Other Litigation 
 From time to time, we are involved in other legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of our business, including proceedings and claims based upon purported violations of antitrust laws, intellectual property rights and tortious interference, which could cause us to incur significant expenses. We have also been the subject of personal injury and wrongful death claims relating to accidents at our venues in connection with our operations. As required, we have accrued our estimate of the probable settlement or other losses for the resolution of any outstanding claims. These estimates have been developed in consultation with counsel and are based upon an analysis of potential results, including, in some cases, estimated redemption rates for the settlement offered, assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies. It is possible, however, that future results of operations for any particular period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions or the effectiveness of our strategies related to these proceedings.

Executive Overview 
 
 For the third quarter of 2024, the Company s operating income decreased by 2 and AOI was up 4 versus 2023. Revenues for the third quarter decreased by 6 to 7.7 billion on both a reported and constant currency basis as compared to the same period last year, due to the reduction in stadium show volume this year. Our operating income for the quarter decreased by 14 million, or 2 , from 654 million in the third quarter of 2023 to 640 million in the third quarter of 2024 due to our Ticketing segment from the reduction in stadium show volume partially offset by improved performance from our Concerts and Sponsorship business segments. The decrease in operating income was 10 million, or 2 , at constant currency. 
 For the first nine months of 2024, our consolidated revenue increased by 566 million, or 3 , compared to the same period in 2023, from 16.9 billion to 17.5 billion. The increase was 651 million, or 4 , on a constant currency basis. We had consolidated operating income of 1.1 billion for the first nine months of 2024, a decrease of 102 million compared to the first nine months of 2023. Despite stronger operating performance in our Concerts and Sponsorship segments, these positive results were negatively impacted by the Astroworld estimated loss contingencies as well as reduced revenue in our Ticketing segment. Consolidated AOI for the first nine months increased by 224 million, or 13 , compared to the same period in 2023, from 1.8 billion to 2.0 billion. The increase was 250 million, or 14 , on a constant currency basis. 
 All of the segment financial comments to follow are based on reported foreign currency exchange rates. 
 Our Concerts segment revenue for the quarter decreased by 391 million, or 6 , from 7.0 billion in the third quarter of 2023 to 6.6 billion in the third quarter of 2024. The revenue reduction was the result of fewer stadium shows and fans this quarter. The total number of events for the third quarter of 2024 was approximately 12,800 compared to 12,100 in the third quarter of 2023, an increase of 700 events or 6 . The number of fans for the quarter was 50 million compared to 52 million last year, a reduction of 2 million fans or 4 . The decrease in activity largely resulted from the aforementioned change in stadium activity partially offset by more fans attending arena shows as well as theaters and clubs. We saw double digit arena fan growth globally this quarter, most notably in the United States. Some of the major acts touring in the third quarter of 2024 included Bruno Mars, Pink, Green Day, and Adele. Our larger festivals in the quarter included Rock in Rio, Lollapalooza Chicago, Rock Werchter in Belgium and Reading and Leads in the United Kingdom. Meanwhile, Concerts AOI for the quarter was 474

 million compared to 341 million in the third quarter of 2023, for growth of 133 million or 39 . Operating income margins increased from 3.2 in the third quarter of 2023 to 4.5 in the third quarter of 2024 while AOI margin for the third quarter of 2024 was 7.2 compared to 4.9 last year. 
 For the first nine months of 2024, Concerts revenue grew 561 million compared to the same period in 2023, from 13.9 billion to 14.4 billion. For the first nine months of 2024, our Concerts fan count was nearly 112 million compared to 108 million for the same period in 2023, an increase of nearly 4 million fans or 3 . Fan growth has been driven by more activity in arenas, our owned and operated amphitheaters as well as more theater and club content. Onsite spending per fan at our United States amphitheater shows for same-store artists (those artists performing at least three amphitheater shows in either 2022 or 2023 compared to 2024) during the first nine months of 2024 is pacing ahead of full-year 2023 by 9 , driven by higher food and beverage and upsell spending. For our larger festivals, the onsite spend growth has continued as well. With roughly 85 of our festival events now played off, we have seen double-digit growth in per fan spend, driven largely by higher food and beverage and VIP sales. Concerts AOI for the first nine months increased by 238 million, or 47 , compared to the same period in 2023, from 505 million to 743 million. Operating income margins decreased from 1.5 for the first nine months of 2023 to 0.8 for the first nine months of 2024, which was impacted by the Astroworld estimated loss contingencies. AOI margin for the first nine months of 2024 was 5.1 compared to 3.6 last year. 
 Our Ticketing segment revenue for the quarter decreased by 144 million, or 17 , from 838 million in the third quarter of 2023 to 694 million in the third quarter of 2024. We sold approximately 83 million fee-bearing tickets in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 89 million tickets in the same period of the prior year. Our revenue and ticket sales declined due to the unprecedented volume of stadium sales last year. Despite the venue mix change, the third quarter was our fourth highest ever in terms of sales volume and our third highest ever with respect to GTV. International Ticketing also had its single biggest sales day ever in September 2024 driven by outstanding demand for Coldplay tickets in Europe. Ticketing AOI for the quarter was 236 million compared to 352 million last year for a reduction of 116 million or 33 . 
 For the first nine months of 2024, our Ticketing segment revenue declined by 72 million compared to the same period in 2023, from 2.2 billion to 2.1 billion. Ticketing AOI for the first nine months of 2024 decreased by 92 million compared to the same period in 2023, from 904 million to 812 million. For the first nine months of 2024, our fee-bearing ticket sales were 238 million tickets, 2 million behind 2023. We have signed clients with over 24 million net new tickets so far this year, of which two-thirds are in our international markets, which demonstrates that our ticketing platforms features and functionalities continue to fuel growth. 
 Our Sponsorship Advertising segment revenue for the quarter increased by 24 million, or 6 , from 367 million in the third quarter of 2023 to 390 million in the third quarter of 2024. The improvement was largely due to growth in festival sponsorship income for Europe, Canada and Brazil where we hosted the Rock in Rio event this year. For the first nine months of 2024, our sponsorship growth has been driven by new and expanded ticket access deals both in North America and in our international markets as well as from onsite sponsorships. AOI for the quarter increased by 25 million, from 250 million in the third quarter of 2023 to 275 million in the third quarter of 2024. For the first nine months of 2024, our Sponsorship Advertising revenue grew 74 million compared to the same period in 2023, from 840 million to 914 million. Sponsorship Advertising AOI for the first nine months increased by 79 million compared to the same period in 2023, from 549 million to 628 million. 
 We are optimistic about the long-term potential of our Company and are focused on the key elements of our business model: expanding our global platforms to connect artists and fans.

 Revenue 
 Revenue decreased 503.5 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period of the prior year primarily due to decreased revenue in our Concerts segment of 391.2 million and in our Ticketing segment of 143.9 million, partially offset by a 23.5 million increase in our Sponsorship Advertising segment as further discussed within each segment s operating results. 
 Operating income 
 Operating income decreased 14.1 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period of the prior year primarily driven by a 116.5 million decrease in our Ticketing segment partially offset by increased operating income in our Concerts segment of 70.2 million and Sponsorship Advertising segment of 27.1 million as further discussed within each segment s operating results. 
 Interest income 
 Interest income decreased 42.0 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period of the prior year primarily attributed to lower rate of return on our cash and cash equivalents in 2024 and a decrease in our cash and cash equivalents balance. 
 Other expense (income), net 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we had other income, net of 12.3 million which includes net foreign exchange rate gains of 12.1 million. For the three months ended September 30, 2023, we had other expense, net of 19.3 million which includes net foreign exchange rate losses of 35.3 million, partially offset by mark to market adjustments for certain investments in nonconsolidated affiliates of 18.8 million. The net foreign exchange rate gains and losses result primarily from revaluation of certain foreign currency denominated net assets held internationally.

 Equity in losses (earnings) of nonconsolidated affiliates 
 Equity in losses (earnings) of nonconsolidated affiliates was losses of 8.5 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to earnings of 15.0 million for the comparable period of the prior year due to lower operating results from certain nonconsolidated affiliates. 
 Other expense (income), net 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we had other income, net of 110.1 million which primarily includes mark to market adjustments for certain investments in nonconsolidated affiliates of 94.7 million and net foreign exchange rate gains of 14.7 million. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we had other expense, net of 24.2 million which includes net foreign exchange rate losses of 65.1 million partially offset by mark to market adjustments for certain investments in nonconsolidated affiliates of 45.3 million. The net foreign exchange rate gains and losses result primarily from revaluation of certain foreign currency denominated net assets held internationally. 
 Income tax expense 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we had a net tax expense of 191.4 million on income before income taxes of 1.0 billion compared to a net tax expense of 127.1 million on an income before income taxes of 1.1 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the income tax expense consisted of 167.4 million related to foreign entities, 4.6 million related to United States federal taxes, and 19.4 million related to state and local income taxes. The net increase in tax expense of 64.3 million was primarily due to higher income in certain non-United States jurisdictions. 
 
 Non-GAAP Measure 
 
 Consolidated AOI 
 Consolidated AOI is a non-GAAP financial measure that we define as consolidated operating income (loss) before certain acquisition expenses (including ongoing legal costs stemming from the Ticketmaster merger, changes in the fair value of accrued acquisition-related contingent consideration obligations, and acquisition-related severance and compensation), amortization of non-recoupable ticketing contract advances, depreciation and amortization (including goodwill impairment), loss (gain) on disposal of operating assets, and stock-based compensation expense. We also exclude from AOI the impact of estimated or realized liabilities for settlements or damages arising out of the Astroworld matter that exceed our estimated insurance recovery, due to the significant and non-recurring nature of the matter. Ongoing legal costs associated with defense of these claims, such as attorney fees, are not excluded from AOI. 
 We use AOI to evaluate the performance of our operating segments. We believe that information about AOI assists investors by allowing them to evaluate changes in the operating results of our portfolio of businesses separate from non-operational factors that affect net income (loss), thus providing insights into both operations and the other factors that affect reported results. AOI is not calculated or presented in accordance with GAAP. A limitation of the use of AOI as a performance measure is that it does not reflect the periodic costs of certain amortizing assets used in generating revenue in our business. Accordingly, AOI should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, operating income (loss), net income (loss), and other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with GAAP. Furthermore, this measure may vary among other companies; thus, AOI as presented herein may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.

 Segment Overview 
 Our reportable segments are Concerts, Ticketing and Sponsorship Advertising. 
 Concerts 
 Revenue and related costs for events are generally deferred and recognized when the event occurs. All advertising costs incurred during the year for shows in future years are expensed at the end of the year. If a current year event is rescheduled into a future year, all advertising costs incurred to date are expensed in the period when the event is rescheduled. 
 Concerts direct operating expenses include artist fees, event production costs, show-related marketing and advertising expenses, along with other costs. 
 To judge the health of our Concerts segment, we primarily monitor the number of confirmed events and fan attendance in our network of operated and third-party venues, talent fees, average paid attendance, market ticket pricing, advance ticket sales and the number of major artist clients under management. In addition, at our operated venues and festivals, we monitor ancillary revenue per fan and premium ticket sales. For business that is conducted in foreign markets, we also compare the operating results from our foreign operations to prior periods without the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates. 
 Ticketing 
 Revenue related to ticketing service charges is recognized when the ticket is sold for our third-party clients. For our own events, where our concert promoters or venues control ticketing, revenue is deferred and recognized when the event occurs. GTV represents the total amount of the transaction related to a ticket sale and includes the face value of the ticket as well as the service charge. We use GTV to evaluate changes in ticket fee revenue that are driven by the pricing of our service charges. 
 Ticketing direct operating expenses include call center costs and credit card fees, along with other costs. 
 To judge the health of our Ticketing segment, we primarily review the GTV and the number of tickets sold through our primary and secondary ticketing operations, the number of clients renewed or added and the average royalty rate paid to clients who use our ticketing services. In addition, we review the number of visits to our websites, cost of customer acquisition, the purchase conversion rate, and the overall number of customers in our database. For business that is conducted in foreign markets, we also compare the operating results from our foreign operations to prior periods without the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates. 
 Sponsorship Advertising 
 Revenue related to sponsorship and advertising programs is recognized over the term of the agreement or operating season as the benefits are provided to the sponsor unless the revenue is associated with a specific event, in which case it is recognized when the event occurs. 
 Sponsorship Advertising direct operating expenses include fulfillment costs related to our sponsorship programs, along with other costs. 
 To judge the health of our Sponsorship Advertising segment, we primarily review the revenue generated through sponsorship arrangements and online advertising, and the percentage of expected revenue under contract. For business that is conducted in foreign markets, we also compare the operating results from our foreign operations to prior periods without the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates.

 (1) Events generally represent a single performance by an artist. Fans generally represent the number of people who attend an event. Festivals are counted as one event in the quarter in which the festival begins, but the number of fans is based on the days the fans were present at the festival and thus can be reported across multiple quarters. Events and fan attendance metrics are estimated each quarter. 
 (2) North America refers to our events and fans within the United States and Canada. 
 (3) The fee-bearing tickets estimated above include primary and secondary tickets that are sold using our Ticketmaster systems or that we issue through affiliates. This metric includes primary tickets sold during the year regardless of event timing, except for our own events where our concert promoters or venues control ticketing which are reported when the events occur. The non-fee-bearing tickets estimated above include primary tickets sold using our Ticketmaster systems, through season seat packages and our venue clients box offices, along with tickets sold on our do it yourself platform. These ticketing metrics are net of any refunds requested and any cancellations that occurred during the period and up to the time of reporting of these consolidated financial statements.

 Three Months 
 Revenue 
 Concerts revenue decreased 391.2 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period of the prior year primarily due to fewer stadium shows partially offset by more arena shows. Concerts had incremental revenue of 104.0 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 from acquisitions and new venues. 
 Operating results 
 Concerts AOI increased 133.1 million and operating income increased 70.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period of the prior year. The increase in AOI was primarily driven by lower direct operating expenses due to fewer stadium shows which were partially offset by a decrease in revenue discussed above. The remaining change in operating income outside of AOI of 62.9 million is primarily associated with higher acquisition expenses of 58.2 million related to certain acquisition transactions. 
 Nine Months 
 Revenue 
 Concerts revenue increased 560.7 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period of the prior year primarily due to increased show count and fan growth. In particular, higher arena and amphitheater shows and related fan count partially offset by fewer stadium shows contributed to the increase in revenue. Concerts had incremental revenue of 257.7 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from acquisitions and new venues.

 Operating results 
 Concerts AOI increased 238.2 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period of the prior year primarily driven by an increase in revenues from the number of shows discussed above partially offset by increased direct operating expenses to support increased show count and fan growth at events and higher selling, general and administrative expenses related to additional headcount and compensation expenses as well as incremental loss from acquisitions and new venues of 22.2 million. The remaining change in operating income outside of AOI of 342.9 million is primarily associated with Astroworld estimated loss contingencies of 279.9 million and higher depreciation and amortization of 45.9 million related to capital expenditures incurred to support the increased operations.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Our cash is centrally managed on a worldwide basis. Our primary short-term liquidity needs are to fund general working capital requirements, capital expenditures and debt service requirements while our long-term liquidity needs are primarily related to acquisitions and debt repayment. Our primary sources of funds for our short-term liquidity needs will be cash flows from operations and borrowings under our amended senior secured credit facility, while our long-term sources of funds will be from cash flows from operations, long-term bank borrowings and other debt or equity financings. We may from time to time engage in open market purchases of our outstanding debt securities or redeem or otherwise repay such debt. 
 Our balance sheet reflects cash and cash equivalents of 5.5 billion at September 30, 2024 and 6.2 billion at December 31, 2023. Included in the September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 cash and cash equivalents balances are 1.6 billion and 1.5 billion, respectively, of cash received that includes the face value of tickets sold on behalf of our ticketing clients and their share of service charges, which we refer to as client cash. We generally do not utilize client cash for our own financing or investing activities as the amounts are payable to clients on a regular basis. Our foreign subsidiaries held approximately 2.7 billion in cash and cash equivalents, excluding client cash, at September 30, 2024. We generally do not repatriate these funds, but if we did, we would need to accrue and pay United States state income taxes as well as any applicable foreign withholding or transaction taxes on future repatriations. 
 We may from time to time enter into borrowings under our revolving credit facility. If the original maturity of these borrowings is 90 days or less, we present the borrowings and subsequent repayments on a net basis in the statement of cash flows to better represent our financing activities. Our balance sheet reflects total net debt of 6.3 billion and 6.6 billion, respectively, at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Our weighted-average cost of debt, excluding unamortized debt discounts and debt issuance costs on our term loans and notes, was 4.6 at September 30, 2024, with approximately 93 of our debt at fixed rates. Our weighted-average cost of debt for short-term borrowings outstanding at September 30, 2024, excluding unamortized debt discounts and debt issuance costs on our term loans and notes, was 3.4 . 
 Our cash and cash equivalents are held in accounts managed by third-party financial institutions and consist of cash in our operating accounts and invested cash. Cash held in non-interest-bearing and interest-bearing operating accounts in many cases exceeds the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insurance limits. The invested cash is in interest-bearing funds consisting primarily of bank deposits and money market funds. While we monitor cash and cash equivalents balances in our operating accounts on a regular basis and adjust the balances as appropriate, these balances could be impacted if the underlying financial institutions fail. To date, we have experienced no loss or lack of access to our cash and cash equivalents; however, we can provide no assurances that access to our cash and cash equivalents will not be impacted by adverse conditions in the financial markets. 
 For our Concerts segment, we often receive cash related to ticket revenue in advance of the event, which is recorded in deferred revenue until the event occurs. In the United States, this cash is largely associated with events in our owned or operated venues, notably amphitheaters, festivals, theaters and clubs. Internationally, this cash is from a combination of both events in our owned or operated venues, as well as events in third-party venues associated with our promoter s share of tickets in allocation markets. With the exception of some upfront costs and artist advances, which are recorded in prepaid expenses until the event occurs, we pay the majority of event-related expenses at or after the event. Artists are paid when the event occurs under one of several different formulas, which may include fixed guarantees and/or a percentage of ticket sales or event profits, net of any advance they have received. When an event is cancelled, any cash held in deferred revenue is reclassified to accrued expenses as those funds are typically refunded to the fan within 30 days of event cancellation. When a show is rescheduled, fans have the ability to request a refund if they do not want to attend the event on the new date, although historically we have had low levels of refund requests for rescheduled events. 
 We view our available cash as cash and cash equivalents, less ticketing-related client cash, less event-related deferred revenue, less accrued expenses due to artists and cash collected on behalf of others, plus event-related prepaid expenses. This is essentially our cash available to, among other things, repay debt balances, make acquisitions, and finance capital expenditures. 
 Our intra-year cash fluctuations are impacted by the seasonality of our various businesses. Examples of seasonal effects include our Concerts segment, which reports the majority of its revenue in the second and third quarters. Cash inflows and outflows depend on the timing of event-related payments but the majority of the inflows generally occur prior to the event. See Seasonality below. We believe that we have sufficient financial flexibility to fund these fluctuations and to access the global capital markets on satisfactory terms and in adequate amounts, although there can be no assurance that this will be the case, and capital could be less accessible and/or more costly given current economic conditions. We expect cash flows from operations and borrowings under our amended senior secured credit facility, along with other financing alternatives, to satisfy working capital requirements, capital expenditures and debt service requirements for at least the succeeding year. We may need to incur additional debt or issue equity to make other strategic acquisitions or investments. There can be no assurance that such financing will be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. We may make significant acquisitions in the near term, subject to limitations imposed by our financing agreements and market conditions.

 The lenders under our revolving loans and counterparty to our interest rate hedge agreement consists of banks and other third-party financial institutions. While we currently have no indications or expectations that such lenders will be unable to fund their commitments as required, we can provide no assurances that future funding availability will not be impacted by adverse conditions in the financial markets. Should an individual lender default on its obligations, the remaining lenders would not be required to fund the shortfall, resulting in a reduction in the total amount available to us for future borrowings, but would remain obligated to fund their own commitments. Should the counterparty to our interest rate hedge agreement default on its obligation, we could experience higher interest rate volatility during the period of any such default. 

Sources of Cash 
 Amended Senior Secured Credit Facility 
 Our senior secured credit facility provides for borrowings of up to 1.7 billion, which was amended on November 5, 2024 (see below), with a 250 million sublimit for the issuance of letters of credit and a 100 million for swingline borrowings. The revolving credit facility allows for a 780 million sublimit for borrowings in U.S. Dollars, Euros, or Sterling, and a 260 million sublimit for borrowings in those or one or more other approved non-U.S. currencies. The revolving credit facility will be available to us and, if designated in the future, certain of our foreign subsidiaries. The Amended Credit Agreement provides for the right, subject to certain conditions, to increase the term B loan and revolving facilities by an amount not to exceed an amount equal to the sum of (x) 1.625 billion, (y) the aggregate principal amount of voluntary prepayments of the term B loans and permanent reductions of the revolving credit facility commitments, in each case, other than from proceeds of long-term indebtedness, and (z) additional amounts so long as the senior secured leverage ratio, on a pro-forma basis after giving effect to such increase, is no greater than 4.50x. 
 Our obligations under the Amended Credit Agreement will continue to be guaranteed by the majority of our direct and indirect domestic subsidiaries, subject to certain exceptions, and the obligations of the foreign subsidiary borrowers, if any, will be guaranteed by us, the majority of our direct and indirect domestic subsidiaries, and by certain of our wholly-owned foreign subsidiaries. The obligations under the Amended Credit Agreement and the guarantees will continue to be secured by a lien on substantially all of our tangible and intangible personal property and the domestic subsidiaries that are guarantors, and by a pledge of substantially all of the shares of stock, partnership interests and limited liability company interests of our direct and indirect domestic subsidiaries and 65 of each class of capital stock of any first-tier foreign subsidiaries and, if there are any foreign borrowers, by certain of the assets of such foreign borrowers and certain foreign subsidiaries, subject to limited exceptions. 
 The interest rates per annum applicable to the revolving credit facility under the amended senior secured credit facility are, at our option, equal to either Term SOFR plus 1.75 or a base rate (as defined in the Credit Agreement) plus 0.75 . 
 The interest rates per annum applicable to the term loan B are, at our option, equal to either Term Benchmark Loans or RFR Loans (as defined in the Credit Agreement) plus 1.75 or a base rate plus 0.75 . We have an interest rate swap agreement that ensures the interest rate on 500 million principal amount of our outstanding term loan B does not exceed 3.445 through October 2026. For the term loan B, we are required to make quarterly payments of 2.4 million with the balance due at maturity in October 2026. We are also required to make mandatory prepayments of the loan, subject to specified exceptions, from excess cash flow and with the proceeds of asset sales, debt issuances and specified other events. 
 We are required to pay a commitment fee of 0.35 per year on the undrawn portion available under the revolving credit facility and variable fees on outstanding letters of credit. Based on our outstanding letters of credit of 21.9 million, 1.28 billion was available for future borrowings from our revolving credit facility as of September 30, 2024. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we repaid 370 million of principal related to our revolving credit facility. No material gain or loss was recorded as a result of this repayment. 
 On October 31, 2024, we drew down 585 million from our senior secured revolving credit facility, and on November 1, 2024, we used these funds to repay the 575 million principal amount plus accrued interest on our 4.875 senior notes. As a result of this drawdown, the 4.875 senior notes were classified as long-term debt as of September 30, 2024 due to utilizing our revolving credit facility for the payment which has a maturity date in 2029, as amended below. 
 On November 5, 2024, we amended our senior secured credit facility and entered into Amendment No. 12 (the Amendment to our Credit Agreement, dated as of May 6, 2010 (as amended, restated, supplemented or modified prior to Amendment No. 12, the Credit Agreement and as amended by Amendment No. 12, the Amended Credit Agreement ). The Amendment added a venue expansion revolving credit facility of 400 million, which resulted in a total available borrowing capacity of 1.7 billion. 
 36 

Table of Contents 

 The Amended Credit Agreement contains a financial covenant that requires the Company to maintain a maximum ratio of consolidated net debt to consolidated EBITDA (both as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement) that ranges from 6.75x to 5.25x, with the first step down of 0.50x occurring on March 31, 2026 and additional step downs of 0.50x occurring annually thereafter. 
 The new revolving credit facility matures on November 5, 2029, provided, that if (x) any of the term B loans, the Company s 2027 senior secured notes, or the Company s 2027 senior unsecured notes remain outstanding on the date that is ninety-one days prior to the stated maturity thereof in an aggregate principal amount in excess of 500.0 million and (y) the Company s consolidated free cash on such date is less than the sum of such outstanding principal amount plus 500.0 million, then the maturity date of the new revolving credit facility will instead be such date. 
 Debt Covenants 
 As of September 30, 2024, we believe we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants related to our senior secured credit facility and our corporate senior secured notes, senior notes and convertible senior notes. We expect to remain in compliance with all of these covenants throughout 2024. 

Uses of Cash 
 Acquisitions 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we completed various acquisitions that resulted in cash paid, net of cash acquired of 49.5 million. 
 Capital Expenditures 
 Venue and ticketing operations require ongoing investment in our existing venues and ticketing systems to address fan and artist expectations, technological industry advances and various federal, state and/or local regulations. 
 We categorize capital outlays between revenue generating capital expenditures and maintenance capital expenditures. Revenue generating capital expenditures are primarily focused on our global venue expansion strategy as we connect more artists to their global fan base and major renovations to buildings to enhance the fan experience and drive improvements in our hospitality efforts including onsite spending and premium experiences. In addition, in Ticketing, we continue to develop new ticketing tools and technology enhancements. Revenue generating capital expenditures can also include smaller projects whose purpose is to increase revenue and/or improve operating income. Maintenance capital expenditures are associated with the renewal and improvement of existing venues and technology systems, web development and administrative offices. Capital expenditures typically increase during periods when our venues are not in operation since that is the time that such improvements can be completed. 
 Our capital expenditures, including accruals for amounts incurred but not yet paid for, but net of expenditures funded by outside parties such as landlords and noncontrolling interest partners or expenditures funded by insurance proceeds, consisted of the following: 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 (in thousands) Revenue generating 363,576 185,148 Maintenance 81,529 72,546 Total capital expenditures 445,105 257,694 
 Revenue generating capital expenditures during the first nine months of 2024 increased from the same period of the prior year primarily due to enhancements at our theaters and amphitheaters in the United States as well as a stadium in South America. 
 We expect capital expenditures to be approximately 700 million for the year ending December 31, 2024 with approximately 75 of the capital expenditures on revenue generating projects.

 Operating Activities 
 Cash provided by operating activities decreased 74.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period of the prior year primarily due to lower net income, changes in the fair value of contingent consideration and higher gain on mark-to-market of investments partially offset by changes in operating assets and liabilities from timing of events on sale, payments and receipts. 
 
 Investing Activities 
 Cash used in investing activities increased 178.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the prior year primarily due to higher purchases of property, plant and equipment in 2024 for revenue generating capital expenditures as well as higher cash paid for acquisitions, net of cash acquired. See Uses of Cash - Acquisitions and Capital Expenditures above for further discussion. 
 
 Financing Activities 
 Cash used in financing activities was 692.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to cash provided by financing activities of 44.9 million for the same period of the prior year primarily due to higher proceeds from long-term debt in 2023 from the issuance of our 3.125 convertible senior notes, which was partially offset by lower payments on long-term debt during 2024 compared to 2023. See Sources of Cash above for further discussion. 

Seasonality 
 Information regarding the seasonality of our business can be found in Part I Financial Information Item 1. Financial Statements Note 1 Basis of Presentation and Other Information. 

Market Risk 
 We are exposed to market risks arising from changes in market rates and prices, including movements in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. 
 Foreign Currency Risk 
 We have operations in countries throughout the world. The financial results of our foreign operations are measured in their local currencies. Our foreign subsidiaries also carry certain net assets or liabilities that are denominated in a currency other than that subsidiary s functional currency. As a result, our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in the foreign markets in which we have operations. We operate in certain countries that are hyper-inflationary, for example Argentina, however the impact of these currencies did not have a material impact on our statement of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Our foreign operations reported an operating income of 523.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. We estimate that a 10 change in the value of the United States dollar relative to foreign currencies would change our operating income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 by 52.4 million. As of September 30, 2024, our most significant foreign exchange exposure included the Euro, British Pound, Australian Dollar, Canadian Dollar and Mexican Peso. This analysis does not consider the implication such currency fluctuations could have on the overall economic conditions of the United States or other foreign countries in which we operate or on the results of operations of our foreign entities. In addition, the reported carrying value of our assets and liabilities, including the total cash and cash equivalents held by our foreign operations, will also be affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. 
 We primarily use forward currency contracts, in addition to options, to reduce our exposure to foreign currency risk associated with short-term artist fee commitments. At September 30, 2024, we had forward currency contracts outstanding with an aggregate notional amount of 244.6 million. 
 38 

Table of Contents 

 Interest Rate Risk 
 Our market risk is also affected by changes in interest rates. We had 6.3 billion of total debt, excluding unamortized debt discounts and issuance costs, outstanding as of September 30, 2024. Of the total amount, we had 5.8 billion of fixed-rate debt and 465.9 million of floating-rate debt. 
 Based on the amount of our floating-rate debt as of September 30, 2024, each 25-basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would increase or decrease our annual interest expense and cash outlay by approximately 1.2 million. This potential increase or decrease is based on the simplified assumption that the level of floating-rate debt remains constant with an immediate across-the-board increase or decrease as of September 30, 2024 with no subsequent change in rates for the remainder of the period. 
 In January 2020, we entered into an interest rate swap agreement that is designated as a cash flow hedge for accounting purposes to effectively convert a portion of our floating-rate debt to a fixed-rate basis. The agreement was amended in February 2023 for the transition from LIBOR to SOFR. The swap agreement expires in October 2026, has a notional amount of 500.0 million and ensures that a portion of our floating-rate debt does not exceed 3.445 . 

Accounting and Other Pronouncements 
 Information regarding recently issued and adopted accounting pronouncements can be found in Part I Financial Information Item 1. Financial Statements Note 1 Basis of Presentation and Other Information. 
 In August 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) was enacted in the United States, which includes health care, clean energy, and income tax provisions. The income tax provisions amend the Internal Revenue Code to include a 15 corporate alternative minimum tax effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2022. On September 12, 2024, the Internal Revenue Service released proposed regulations which provide guidance on the application of the corporate alternative minimum tax. The company is assessing the impact of the proposed regulations; however, it does not expect the IRA to have a material impact on the 2024 financial statements. We will continue to monitor to ensure our financial results and related tax disclosures are in compliance with the IRA tax legislation. 
 On December 20, 2021, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development OECD released Pillar Two model rules designed to ensure large multinational enterprises MNE pay a minimum level of tax arising in each jurisdiction they operate. Over 135 jurisdictions joined a plan to update key elements of the international tax system and provide for a coordinated system of taxation that imposes top-up tax on profits arising in a jurisdiction whenever the effective rate is below the minimum rate. Effective January 1, 2024, many of these jurisdictions have enacted a global 15 minimum effective tax rate. This minimum rate applies to MNE s with consolidated revenue above 750 million. While additional guidance is expected from the OECD in 2024, we do not expect The Pillar Two rules to have a material impact to our financial statement income or tax cash flows for the current period. We will continue to monitor further guidance from the OECD and evaluate any impact it may have to our consolidated financial results. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 The preparation of our financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates that are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The result of these evaluations forms the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the reported amount of revenue and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates, and such difference could be material. 
 Management believes that the accounting estimates involved in business combinations, impairment of long-lived assets and goodwill, revenue recognition, and income taxes are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results, and they require management s most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These critical accounting estimates, the judgments and assumptions and the effect if actual results differ from these assumptions are described in Part II Financial Information Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on February 22, 2024. 
 There have been no changes to our critical accounting policies during the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 We have established disclosure controls and procedures to ensure that material information relating to our company, including our consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to the officers who certify our financial reports and to other members of senior management and our board of directors. 
 Based on their evaluation as of September 30, 2024, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) are effective to ensure that (1) the information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and (2) the information we are required to disclose in such reports is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or internal controls will prevent all possible errors and fraud. Our disclosure controls and procedures are, however, designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives, and our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective at that reasonable assurance level. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting during the period covered by this report that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Risk Factors of our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on February 22, 2024, describes some of the risks and uncertainties associated with our business which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations, and the trading price of our common stock could decline as a result.
