 The creditors of the VIEs generally do not have recourse to the Company s general credit solely by virtue of being creditors of the VIEs. However, certain of the financial covenants included in the inventory financing facilities to which the VIEs are party are calculated by reference to Opendoor Labs Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries' assets and liabilities. As a result, under certain circumstances, this may limit the Company's flexibility to transfer assets from Opendoor subsidiaries to the Parent Company. See Note 5 Credit Facilities and Long-Term Debt for further discussion of the recourse obligations with respect to the VIEs.

 Non-Recourse Asset-backed Debt 
 The Company utilizes inventory financing facilities consisting of asset-backed senior debt facilities and asset-backed mezzanine term debt facilities to provide financing for the Company s real estate inventory purchases and renovation. These inventory financing facilities are typically secured by some combination of restricted cash, equity in real estate owning subsidiaries and related holding companies, and, for senior facilities, the real estate inventory financed by the relevant facility and/or beneficial interests in such inventory. 
 Each of the borrowers under the inventory financing facilities is a consolidated subsidiary of Opendoor and a separate legal entity. Neither the assets nor credit of any such borrower subsidiaries are generally available to satisfy the debts and other obligations of any other Opendoor entities. The inventory financing facilities are non-recourse to the Company and are non-recourse to Opendoor subsidiaries not party to the relevant facilities, except for limited guarantees provided by an Opendoor subsidiary for certain obligations involving bad acts by an Opendoor entity and certain other limited circumstances. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company had total borrowing capacity with respect to its non-recourse asset-backed debt of billion. Borrowing capacity amounts under non-recourse asset-backed debt as reflected in the table above are in some cases not fully committed and any borrowings above the committed amounts are subject to the applicable lender s discretion. Any amounts repaid for senior term and mezzanine term debt facilities reduce total borrowing capacity as repaid amounts are not available to be reborrowed. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had committed borrowing capacity with respect to the Company s non-recourse asset-backed debt of billion; this committed borrowing capacity is comprised of million for senior revolving credit facilities, billion for senior term debt facilities, and million for mezzanine term debt facilities.

 months during which time amounts can be borrowed, repaid and borrowed again. The borrowing capacity is generally available until the end of the applicable revolving period as reflected in the table above. Outstanding amounts drawn under each senior revolving credit facility are required to be repaid on the facility maturity date or earlier if accelerated due to an event of default or other mandatory repayment event. The final maturity dates and revolving period end dates reflected in the table above are inclusive of any extensions that are at the sole discretion of the Company. These facilities may also have extensions subject to lender discretion that are not reflected in the table above. 
 Borrowings under the senior revolving credit facilities accrue interest at various floating rates based on a secured overnight financing rate SOFR ), plus a margin that varies by facility. The Company may also pay fees on certain unused portions of committed borrowing capacity. The Company s senior revolving credit facility arrangements typically include upfront fees that may be paid at execution of the applicable agreements or be earned at execution and payable over time. These facilities are generally fully prepayable at any time without penalty other than customary breakage costs. 
 The senior revolving credit facilities have aggregated borrowing bases, which increase or decrease based on the cost and value of the properties financed under a given facility and the time that those properties are in the Company s possession. When the Company resells a home, the proceeds are used to reduce the outstanding balance under the related senior revolving credit facility. The borrowing base for a given facility may be reduced as properties age beyond certain thresholds or the performance of the properties financed under that facility declines, and any borrowing base deficiencies may be satisfied through contributions of additional properties or partial repayment of the facility. 
 Asset-backed Senior Term Debt Facilities 
 The Company classifies its senior term debt facilities as current or non-current liabilities on the Company s condensed consolidated balance sheets based on the applicable final maturity date. 
 The senior term debt facilities are typically structured with an initial withdrawal period up to months during which the outstanding principal amounts are generally not required to be repaid when homes financed through those facilities are sold and instead are intended to remain outstanding until final maturity for each facility. Outstanding amounts drawn under each senior term debt facility are required to be repaid on the facility maturity date or earlier if accelerated due to an event of default or other mandatory repayment event. The final maturity dates and withdrawal period end dates reflected in the table above are inclusive of any extensions that are at the sole discretion of the Company. These facilities may also have extensions subject to lender discretion that are not reflected in the table above. 
 Borrowings under the senior term debt facilities accrue interest at a fixed rate. The Company's senior term debt facilities may include upfront issuance costs that are capitalized as part of the facilities' respective carrying values. These facilities are fully prepayable at any time but may be subject to certain customary prepayment penalties. 
 The senior term debt facilities have aggregated property borrowing bases, which increase or decrease based on the cost and value of the properties financed under a given facility, the time those properties are in the Company s possession and the amount of cash collateral pledged by the relevant borrowers. The borrowing base for a given facility may be reduced as properties age or collateral performance declines beyond certain thresholds, and any borrowing base deficiencies may be satisfied through contributions of additional properties, cash or through partial repayment of the facility. 
 Asset-backed Mezzanine Term Debt Facilities 
 The Company classifies its mezzanine term debt facilities as current or non-current liabilities on the Company s condensed consolidated balance sheets based on the applicable final maturity date. These facilities are structurally and contractually subordinated to the related asset-backed senior debt facilities.

 Covenants 
 The Company s inventory financing facilities include customary representations and warranties, covenants and events of default. Financed properties are subject to customary eligibility criteria and concentration limits. 
 The terms of these inventory financing facilities and related financing documents require an Opendoor subsidiary to comply with customary financial covenants, such as maintaining certain levels of liquidity, tangible net worth or leverage (ratio of debt to tangible net worth). Certain of these financial covenants are calculated by reference to Opendoor Labs Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries assets and liabilities. As a result, under certain circumstances, this may limit the Company s flexibility to transfer assets from Opendoor subsidiaries to the Parent Company. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, million and million, respectively, of the Company s net assets were restricted as they reflect minimum net asset requirements at Opendoor Labs Inc. As of September 30, 2024, the Company was in compliance with all financial covenants and no event of default had occurred.

The Company's provision for income taxes was and million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, with an effective tax rate of ) and ) , respectively. The effective tax rate differs from the U.S. statutory tax rate primarily due to the recording of a full valuation allowance against the net deferred tax assets. 
 The Company evaluated the positive and negative evidence bearing upon the realizability of its deferred tax assets by jurisdiction. Based on the Company s history of operating losses, including a three-year cumulative loss position, the Company believes that based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that all of the deferred tax assets in the U.S. will not be realized and recorded a full valuation allowance of its federal and state net deferred tax assets as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

 The Company uses the two-class method to calculate net loss per share and apply the more dilutive of the two-class method, treasury stock method or if-converted method to calculate diluted net loss per share. Undistributed earnings for each period are allocated to participating securities, based on the contractual participation rights of the security to share in the current earnings as if all current period earnings had been distributed. As there is no contractual obligation for participating securities to share in losses, the Company s basic net loss per share is computed by dividing the net loss attributable to common shareholders by the weighted-average shares of common stock outstanding during periods with undistributed losses.)

 Legal Matters 
 From time to time, the Company may be subject to potential liability relating to the ownership and operations of the Company s properties. Accruals are recorded when the outcome is probable and can be reasonably estimated. 
 There are various claims and lawsuits arising in the normal course of business pending against the Company, some of which seek damages and other relief which, if granted, may require future cash expenditures. In addition, from time to time the Company receives inquiries and audit requests from various government agencies and fully cooperates with these requests. The Company does not believe that it is reasonably possible that the resolution of these matters would result in any liability that would materially affect the Company s condensed consolidated results of operations or financial condition except as noted below. 
 On October 7, 2022 and November 22, 2022, purported securities class action lawsuits were filed in the United States District Court for the District of Arizona, captioned Alich v. Opendoor Technologies Inc., et al. (Case No. 2:22-cv-01717-JFM) Alich and Oakland County Voluntary Employee s Beneficiary Association, et al. v. Opendoor Technologies Inc., et al. (Case No. 2:22-cv-01987-GMS) Oakland County ), respectively. The lawsuits were consolidated into a single action, captioned In re Opendoor Technologies Inc. Securities Litigation (Case No. 2:22-CV-01717-MTL). The consolidated amended complaint names as defendants the Company, Social Capital Hedosophia Holdings Corp. II (SCH"), certain of the Company s current and former officers and directors and the underwriters of a securities offering the Company made in February 2021. The complaint alleges that the Company and certain officers violated Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and SEC Rule 10b-5, and that the Company, SCH, certain officers and directors and the underwriters violated Section 11 of the Securities Act, in each case by making materially false or misleading statements related to the effectiveness of the Company s pricing algorithm. The plaintiffs also allege that certain defendants violated Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act and Section 15 of the Securities Act, respectively, which provide for control person liability. The complaint asserts claims on behalf of all persons and entities that purchased, or otherwise acquired, Company common stock between December 21, 2020 and November 3, 2022 or pursuant to offering documents issued in connection with our business combination with SCH and the secondary public offering conducted by the Company in February 2021. The plaintiffs seek class certification, an award of unspecified compensatory damages, an award of interest and reasonable costs and expenses, including attorneys fees and expert fees, and other and further relief as the court may deem just and proper. The defendants filed motions to dismiss on June 30, 2023, which the court granted on February 27, 2024 without prejudice. On May 14, 2024, the court granted plaintiffs motion for reconsideration of certain portions of the court s order dismissing the complaint. The court s orders on the motion to dismiss and motion for reconsideration dismissed all Exchange Act claims and Securities Act claims except for a portion of plaintiffs claims brought under Section 11 and Section 15 of the Securities Act. Defendants filed answers to the complaint on July 12, 2024. The Company continues to believe that the allegations in the complaint are without merit and intends to vigorously defend itself in the matter. 
 On March 1, 2023 and March 15, 2023, shareholder derivative lawsuits were filed in the United States District Court for the District of Arizona, captioned Carlson v. Rice, et al. (Case No. 2:23-cv-00367-GMS) and Van Dorn v. Wu, et al. (Case No. 2:23-cv-00455-DMF), respectively, which were subsequently consolidated into a single action, captioned Carlson v. Rice

 Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 
 The following discussion and analysis provides information that our management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of our condensed consolidated results of operations and financial condition. The discussion should be read together with the historical condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes that appear in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 This discussion may contain forward-looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those set forth under Forward-Looking Statements, Risk Factors, or in other parts of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, and in Part I - Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 (the Annual Report ). 
 
 Overview 
 Opendoor s mission is to power life s progress, one move at a time. Residential real estate is a trillion-dollar industry underpinned by a process that is complicated, time-consuming, stressful, and offline. We believe all consumers deserve to buy, sell, and move between homes with simplicity and confidence, and we have dedicated almost a decade to delivering on this vision. We have built unique pricing and operations capabilities to become one of the largest buyers and sellers of homes in the United States. Since our founding, we have helped customers to buy or sell homes in over 269,000 transactions and have expanded our footprint to 50 markets across the country.

 Current Housing Environment 
 The housing market remains under pressure as elevated mortgage rates and economic volatility continue to shape the landscape. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, mortgage rates showed some relief, with the average rate falling from 7.1 to 6.1 over the course of the quarter. However, this downward trend was short-lived, with mortgage rates partially rebounding in October 2024. This rebound occurred despite the Federal Reserve s 50 basis point cut in September 2024, as stronger-than-expected jobs data caused the market to reassess the trajectory of future rate cuts, and fiscal spending uncertainty also pushed treasury yields higher. 
 Homeowners remain locked into existing low-rate mortgages and home buyers continue to face affordability constraints. This dynamic has translated to a seasonally adjusted annual sales pace of under 4 million homes, as compared to the decade average of over 5 million homes. Continued slowing of resale clearance (the pace at which listed homes enter into a resale contract) has led month-over-month home price appreciation HPA to trend below historical norms. In addition, the sustained high level of delistings, now at more than 1 delisting for every 4 resales, highlights the ongoing disconnect between sellers price expectations and buyers willingness to pay. 
 In this environment, we maintain a flexible approach, dynamically managing pricing strategies to navigate the complex trade-offs of growth, margin, and risk. We aim to stay nimble and capitalize on potential shifts, particularly if macroeconomic conditions become more favorable or if interest rates move lower. 
 
 Factors Affecting our Business Performance 
 Market Penetration in Existing Markets 
 Residential real estate is one of the largest consumer markets in the United States, of which less than 1 of the estimated 1.6 trillion of home value transacted annually is conducted online. Given the fact that we operate in a highly fragmented industry and offer a differentiated value proposition to the traditional offline selling process, we believe there is significant opportunity to expand our share in our existing markets. By providing a consistent, high-quality and differentiated experience to our customers, we hope to continue to drive positive word-of-mouth awareness and trust in our platform. 
 We are steadily growing our reach via our partnership channels with homebuilders, agents, and online real estate platforms. We have relationships with two of the largest online real estate platforms, Zillow and Redfin, which together reach millions of unique monthly visitors. We launched our partnership agreement with Zillow, Inc. in early 2023, allowing home sellers on the Zillow, Inc. platform to request an offer directly from Opendoor. We also have a partnership with eXp Realty, the largest independent real estate company in the world, which enables eXp Realty s agents to easily request an Opendoor cash offer on qualifying properties to present alongside the option of a market listing for their client s home. In addition to driving incremental acquisitions, we expect these partnerships to build our brand awareness and serve as additional avenues for sellers to learn about the benefits of our flagship cash offer. 
 A continued source of growth is re-engagement with our base of registered sellers, meaning sellers that have received an offer from Opendoor but have not yet sold their home. In the last ten years, we have sent millions of offers and, while not everyone is ready to act when they request an offer, we treat everyone as a potential future seller. We perpetually iterate on our reengagement strategies and believe that our registered customer base will continue to be an important source of home acquisition volumes. 
 Market Footprint 
 The following table represents the number of markets we operated in as of the periods presented:

 Due to the deteriorating macro environment in 2022 and 2023, we slowed down our new market expansion plans and are focused on expanding our share in our existing markets.

 Adjacent Services 
 We believe home sellers and buyers value simplicity and certainty. To that end, we are building an online, integrated suite of home services, which currently includes title insurance, escrow services and real estate brokerage services. 
 Our success with title insurance and escrow services helps validate our view that customers prefer an online, integrated experience. We will continue to evaluate new ways to improve our end-to-end solution and expect to invest in additional adjacent products and services over time with the expectation that these adjacent services will continue to improve our unit economics. 
 Unit Economics 
 We view Contribution Margin as a key measure of unit economic performance. Contribution Margin is a non-GAAP financial measure. See Non-GAAP Financial Measures for further details and a reconciliation of Contribution Margin to Gross Margin. Our long-term financial performance depends, in part, on continuing to maintain and expand unit margins through the following initiatives: 
 Optimization and enhancements of our pricing engine; 
 Platform efficiency improvements through greater automation and self-service; 
 Incremental attach of services, which supplement the core transaction margin profile; and 
 Expansion of our listing and marketplace product offerings, which will reduce our inventory exposure and capital intensity, and eliminate the holding and selling costs associated with taking ownership of the home. 
 Inventory Management 
 Effectively managing our overall inventory position and balancing growth, margin, and risk are critical to our financial performance. Since our inception, we have prioritized investment in our pricing capabilities across our home acquisition processes and our forecasting and resale systems, and will continue to do so. As part of our overall risk management framework, we consider both individual market and aggregate portfolio exposures. We typically seek to maximize the resale margin performance of our inventory in the context of managing overall risk and inventory health through monitoring sell-through rates, holding periods, and portfolio aging, and we will adjust down listed prices on our inventory when appropriate to stay in-line with market sell-through rates and drive resale clearance. We also adjust the spreads embedded in our offers to respond to current market conditions, both at a macro and local level. (Spreads are defined as total discount to our home valuation at time of offer less the Opendoor service fee of 5 .) 
 Real estate inventory is reviewed for valuation adjustments on a quarterly basis. If the carrying amount for a given home is not expected to be recovered, an inventory valuation adjustment is recorded to cost of revenue and the home s carrying value is adjusted to its net realizable value. Inventory valuation adjustments are not offset by any expected gains and are not reversed or adjusted should the expected net realizable value subsequently increase. We recorded inventory valuation adjustments of 10 million and 51 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and 17 million and 54 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. See Part II Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Real Estate Inventory in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 As one key measure of inventory management performance, we evaluate our portfolio metrics relative to the broader market (as observed on the MLS). One such metric is our percentage of homes on the market for greater than 120 days as measured from initial listing date. As of September 30, 2024, such homes represented 23 of our portfolio, compared to 18 for the broader market when filtered for the types of homes we are able to underwrite and acquire in a given market based on characteristics such as price range, home type, home location, year built and lot size (which we refer to as our buybox ). 
 Inventory Financing 
 Our business model is working capital intensive and inventory financing is a key enabler of our growth. We primarily rely on our access to non-recourse asset-backed debt, which consists of asset-backed senior debt facilities and asset-backed

 mezzanine term debt facilities, to finance our home acquisitions. See Liquidity and Capital Resources Debt and Financing Arrangements. 
 Seasonality 
 The residential real estate market is seasonal, with greater demand and home price appreciation from home buyers in the spring and summer, and typically weaker demand and lower home price appreciation in late fall and winter. In general, we expect our financial results and working capital requirements to reflect seasonal variations over time. However, other factors, including growth, market expansion and changes in macroeconomic conditions, such as rising inflation and interest rate increases as recently observed, have obscured the impact of seasonality in our historical financials and we expect may continue to do so. 
 
 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 In addition to our results of operations below, we report certain financial measures that are not required by, or presented in accordance with, U.S. generally accepted accounting principles GAAP ). 
 These measures have limitations as analytical tools when assessing our operating performance and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for GAAP measures, including gross profit and net loss. We may calculate or present our non-GAAP financial measures differently than other companies who report measures with similar titles and, as a result, the non-GAAP financial measures we report may not be comparable with those of companies in our industry or in other industries. 
 Adjusted Gross Profit (Loss) and Contribution Profit (Loss) 
 To provide investors with additional information regarding our margins and return on inventory acquired, we have included Adjusted Gross Profit (Loss) and Contribution Profit (Loss), which are non-GAAP financial measures. We believe that Adjusted Gross Profit (Loss) and Contribution Profit (Loss) are useful financial measures for investors as they are supplemental measures used by management in evaluating unit level economics and our operating performance. Each of these measures is intended to present the economics related to homes sold during a given period. We do so by including revenue generated from homes sold (and adjacent services) in the period and only the expenses that are directly attributable to such home sales, even if such expenses were recognized in prior periods, and excluding expenses related to homes that remain in inventory as of the end of the period. Contribution Profit (Loss) provides investors a measure to assess Opendoor s ability to generate returns on homes sold during a reporting period after considering home purchase costs, renovation and repair costs, holding costs and selling costs. 
 Adjusted Gross Profit (Loss) and Contribution Profit (Loss) are supplemental measures of our operating performance and have limitations as analytical tools. For example, these measures include costs that were recorded in prior periods under GAAP and exclude, in connection with homes held in inventory at the end of the period, costs required to be recorded under GAAP in the same period. Accordingly, these measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. We include a reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, which is gross profit. 
 Adjusted Gross Profit (Loss) / Margin 
 We calculate Adjusted Gross Profit (Loss) as gross profit under GAAP adjusted for (1) inventory valuation adjustment in the current period, and (2) inventory valuation adjustment in prior periods. Inventory valuation adjustment in the current period is calculated by adding back the inventory valuation adjustments recorded during the period on homes that remain in inventory at period end. Inventory valuation adjustment in prior periods is calculated by subtracting the inventory valuation adjustments recorded in prior periods on homes sold in the current period. Adjusted Gross Margin is Adjusted Gross Profit (Loss) as a percentage of revenue. 
 We view this metric as an important measure of business performance as it captures gross margin performance isolated to homes sold in a given period and provides comparability across reporting periods. Adjusted Gross Profit (Loss) helps management assess home pricing, service fees and renovation performance for a specific resale cohort.

 Contribution Profit (Loss) / Margin 
 We calculate Contribution Profit (Loss) as Adjusted Gross Profit (Loss), minus certain costs incurred on homes sold during the current period including: (1) holding costs incurred in the current period, (2) holding costs incurred in prior periods, and (3) direct selling costs. The composition of our holding costs is described in the footnotes to the reconciliation table below. Contribution Margin is Contribution Profit (Loss) as a percentage of revenue. 
 We view this metric as an important measure of business performance as it captures the unit level performance isolated to homes sold in a given period and provides comparability across reporting periods. Contribution Profit (Loss) helps management assess inflows and outflows directly associated with a specific resale cohort.

 Adjusted Net Loss and Adjusted EBITDA 
 We also present Adjusted Net Loss and Adjusted EBITDA, which are non-GAAP financial measures that management uses to assess our underlying financial performance. These measures are also commonly used by investors and analysts to compare the underlying performance of companies in our industry. We believe these measures provide investors with meaningful period over period comparisons of our underlying performance, adjusted for certain charges that are non-cash, not directly related to our revenue-generating operations, not aligned to related revenue, or not reflective of ongoing operating results that vary in frequency and amount. 
 Adjusted Net Loss and Adjusted EBITDA are supplemental measures of our operating performance and have important limitations. For example, these measures exclude the impact of certain costs required to be recorded under GAAP. These measures also include inventory valuation adjustments that were recorded in prior periods under GAAP and exclude, in connection with homes held in inventory at the end of the period, inventory valuation adjustments required to be recorded under GAAP in the same period. These measures could differ substantially from similarly titled measures presented by other companies in our industry or companies in other industries. Accordingly, these measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. We include a reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, which is net loss. 
 Adjusted Net Loss 
 We calculate Adjusted Net Loss as GAAP net loss adjusted to exclude non-cash expenses of stock-based compensation, equity securities fair value adjustment, and intangibles amortization expense. It excludes expenses that are not directly related to our revenue-generating operations such as restructuring. It excludes loss (gain) on extinguishment of debt as these expenses or gains were incurred as a result of decisions made by management to repay portions of our outstanding credit facilities and the 0.25 convertible senior notes due in 2026 (the "2026 Notes") early; these expenses are not reflective of ongoing operating results and vary in frequency and amount. Adjusted Net Loss also aligns the timing of inventory valuation adjustments recorded under GAAP to the period in which the related revenue is recorded in order to improve the comparability of this measure to our non-GAAP financial measures of unit economics, as described above. Our calculation of Adjusted Net Loss does not currently include the tax effects of the non-GAAP adjustments because our taxes and such tax effects have not been material to date. 
 Adjusted EBITDA / Margin 
 We calculated Adjusted EBITDA as Adjusted Net Loss adjusted for depreciation and amortization, property financing and other interest expense, interest income, and income tax expense. Adjusted EBITDA is a supplemental performance measure that our management uses to assess our operating performance and the operating leverage in our business. Adjusted EBITDA Margin is Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenue.

 Components of Our Results of Operations 
 Revenue 
 We generate the majority of our revenue from the sale of homes that we previously acquired from homeowners. In addition, we generate revenue from additional services we provide to both home sellers and buyers, which consists primarily of title insurance and escrow services and brokerage services. 
 Home sales revenue from selling residential real estate is recognized when title to and possession of the property has transferred to the buyer and we have no continuing involvement with the property, which is generally the close of escrow. The amount of revenue recognized for each home sale is equal to the sale price of the home net of any concessions. 
 Cost of Revenue 
 Cost of revenue includes the property purchase price, acquisition costs, and direct costs to renovate or repair the home. These costs are accumulated in real estate inventory during the property holding period and charged to cost of revenue under the specific identification method when the property is sold. Real estate inventory is reviewed for valuation adjustments at least quarterly. If the carrying amount for a given home is not expected to be recovered, an inventory valuation adjustment is recorded to cost of revenue and the home s carrying value is adjusted to its net realizable value. Additionally, for our revenue other than home sales revenue, cost of revenue consists of any costs incurred in delivering the service, including associated headcount expenses such as salaries, benefits, and stock-based compensation. 
 Operating Expenses 
 Sales, Marketing and Operations Expense 
 Sales, marketing and operations expense consists primarily of broker commissions (paid to the home buyers real estate agents and third-party listing agents, if applicable), resale closing costs, holding costs related to real estate inventory including utilities, property taxes and maintenance, and expenses associated with product marketing, promotions and brand-building. Sales, marketing and operations expense also includes any headcount expenses in support of sales, marketing, and real estate operations such as salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation. 
 General and Administrative Expense 
 General and administrative expense consists primarily of headcount expenses, including salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation for our executive, finance, human resources, legal and administrative personnel, third-party professional services fees and rent expense. 
 Technology and Development Expense 
 Technology and development expense consists primarily of headcount expenses, including salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation for employees in the design, development, testing, maintenance and operation of our mobile applications, websites, tools, applications, and mobile apps that support our products. Technology and development expense also includes amortization of capitalized software development costs and third-party software and hosting costs. 
 Restructuring Expense 
 Restructuring expense consists primarily of severance and other termination benefits for employees whose roles have been eliminated. 
 (Loss) Gain on Extinguishment of Debt 
 (Loss) gain on extinguishment of debt is primarily related to the Company s partial repurchase of the 2026 Notes at a discount net of unamortized deferred costs associated with the 2026 Notes. (Loss) gain on extinguishment of debt also includes any gains or losses recognized in conjunction with the termination of debt facilities, partial debt extinguishments, and unamortized deferred costs associated with these facilities.

 Consolidated Financial Statements Note 5. Credit Facilities and Long-Term Debt Convertible Senior Notes for additional information regarding the 2026 Notes. 
 Interest Expense 
 Interest expense consists primarily of interest paid or payable and the amortization of debt discounts and debt issuance costs. Interest expense varies period over period, primarily due to fluctuations in our inventory volumes and changes in the floating benchmark interest rates Benchmark Rates ), based on the secured overnight financing rate SOFR ), plus an applicable margin, which impact the interest incurred on our senior revolving credit facilities (see Liquidity and Capital Resources Debt and Financing Arrangements ). 
 We expect our overall interest expense to increase as inventory increases. Subject to market conditions and cost of capital trade-offs, we will evaluate opportunities to expand our sources of financing over time, which may allow us to diversify our mix of financing sources to include more cost-effective financing relative to our higher cost mezzanine term debt facilities. 
 Other Income Net 
 Other income net consists primarily of interest income on our Cash and Restricted cash balances and from our investment in money market funds, time deposits, and debt securities as well as changes in fair value of, and dividend income from, our investment in equity securities, and gains from deconsolidation. 
 Income Tax Expense 
 We record income taxes using the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recorded based on the estimated future tax effects of differences between the financial statement and income tax basis of existing assets and liabilities. These differences are measured using the enacted statutory tax rates that are expected to apply to taxable income for the years in which differences are expected to reverse. We recognize the effect on deferred income taxes of a change in tax rates in income in the period that includes the enactment date. 
 We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets and liabilities to the net amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized. We consider all available evidence, both positive and negative, including historical levels of income, expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance.

 Revenue 
 Revenue increased by 397 million, or 41 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in revenue was primarily attributable to higher sales volumes in the third quarter of 2024. We sold 3,615 homes during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 2,687 homes during the three months ended September 30, 2023, representing an increase of 35 . Revenue per home sold increased 4 between the same periods. The lower sales in 2023 reflect the Company's actions to slow inventory growth via higher spreads and lower marketing spend during the real estate market correction beginning in the second half of 2022. Inventory levels reached a low in

 June 2023 and have been steadily rebuilding thereafter. The Company entered the third quarter of 2024 with 6,399 homes in inventory as compared to 3,558 homes in inventory at the start of the third quarter of 2023, representing an 80 increase in homes available for resale. 
 Revenue decreased by 2.0 billion, or 33 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in revenue was primarily attributable to lower sales volumes in the first nine months of 2024. We sold 10,771 homes during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 16,344 homes during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, representing a decrease of 34 . Revenue per home sold increased 2 between the same periods. The decrease in sales volumes was primarily attributable to proactively slowing inventory acquisitions beginning in the third quarter of 2022 via higher spreads embedded in our offers in reaction to volatility in the U.S. housing market coupled with a focus on clearing existing inventory, which had reached peak levels in 2022. The Company entered 2024 with 5,326 homes in inventory as compared to 12,788 homes in inventory at the start of 2023, representing a 58 decrease in homes available for resale. 
 Cost of Revenue and Gross Profit 
 Cost of revenue increased by 388 million, or 44 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in cost of revenue was primarily attributable to higher sales volumes and an 8 increase in cost of revenue per home, excluding valuation adjustments on homes in inventory at period end, due to lower spreads embedded in our acquisition offers beginning in September 2023. 
 Cost of revenue decreased by 1.9 billion, or 34 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in cost of revenue was primarily attributable to lower sales volumes and a 1 decrease in cost of revenue per home, excluding valuation adjustments on homes in inventory at period end, due to the slowdown in inventory acquisition pacing as discussed above. 
 Gross profit increased from 96 million to 105 million and gross margin decreased from 9.8 to 7.6 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and September 30, 2024, respectively. For the same periods, Adjusted Gross Margin decreased from 8.6 to 7.2 and Contribution Margin decreased from 4.4 to 3.8 . The decrease in gross margin, Adjusted Gross Margin and Contribution Margin reflects lower spreads embedded in our acquisition offers beginning in September 2023. Adjusted Gross Margin and Contribution Margin for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and September 30, 2024 are inclusive of 29 million and 16 million of inventory valuation adjustments recorded in prior periods on homes sold in the current period in order to reduce the carrying value of these homes to their net realizable value. Adjusted Gross Margin and Contribution Margin are non-GAAP financial measures. See Non-GAAP Financial Measures for further details and a reconciliation of such non-GAAP measures to their nearest comparable GAAP measures. 
 Gross profit decreased from 415 million to 348 million and gross margin increased from 6.8 to 8.6 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and September 30, 2024, respectively. For the same periods, Adjusted Gross Margin increased from (0.2) to 8.8 and Contribution Margin increased from (4.7) to 5.0 . The increase in gross margin, Adjusted Gross Margin and Contribution Margin reflects relative home price stabilization as well as higher spreads embedded in our acquisition offers beginning in the third quarter of 2022. Adjusted Gross Margin and Contribution Margin for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and September 30, 2024 are inclusive of 450 million and 24 million of inventory valuation adjustments recorded in prior periods on homes sold in the current period in order to reduce the carrying value of these homes to their net realizable value. Adjusted Gross Margin and Contribution Margin are non-GAAP financial measures. See Non-GAAP Financial Measures for further details and a reconciliation of such non-GAAP measures to their nearest comparable GAAP measures. 
 Operating Expenses 
 Sales, Marketing and Operations . Sales, marketing and operations increased by 11 million, or 13 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to a 7 million increase in property holding costs, consistent with increased inventory levels, and a 4 million increase in resale transaction costs and broker commissions, consistent with the 41 increase in revenue during the same period. The increase was partially offset by a 1 million decrease in advertising expense, which decreased from 16 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 15 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024.

 (Tabular amounts in millions, except share and per share data and ratios, or as noted) 

 Sales, marketing and operations decreased by 72 million, or 18 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily attributable to a 62 million decrease in resale transaction costs and broker commissions, consistent with the 33 decrease in revenue during the same period. In addition, for the same period, headcount expenses, including salaries and benefits, and contingent labor expenses decreased by 13 million, which was largely attributable to workforce reductions in 2023. Advertising expense increased 5 million, from 58 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 63 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 General and Administrative . General and administrative decreased by 2 million, or 4 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was mainly attributable to a 2 million decrease in depreciation expense as we slowed our pace of fixed assets additions and existing assets became fully depreciated. 
 General and administrative decreased by 17 million, or 11 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was mainly attributable to a 7 million decrease in depreciation expense as we slowed our pace of fixed assets additions and existing assets became fully depreciated. In addition, headcount expenses, including salaries and benefits, decreased 5 million primarily due to workforce reductions in 2023. In addition, rent expense decreased by 2 million. 
 Technology and Development . Technology and development decreased by 12 million, or 29 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily attributable to a 11 million decrease in headcount expenses, including salaries and benefits due to workforce reductions in 2023. 
 Technology and development decreased by 13 million, or 11 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily attributable to 14 million decrease in headcount expenses, including salaries and benefits due to workforce reductions in 2023. 
 Restructuring . Restructuring decreased by 10 million, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Restructuring expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was attributable to the Company s April 2023 workforce reduction of approximately 22 of our workforce or 560 employees. 
 (Loss) Gain on Extinguishment of Debt 
 (Loss) gain on extinguishment of debt decreased by 183 million, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The gain on extinguishment of debt during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 resulted from the Company s partial repurchase of its 2026 Notes in March and May 2023 at a discount net of unamortized deferred costs associated with the 2026 Notes, partially offset by expenses related to partial debt extinguishments. 
 Interest Expense 
 Interest expense decreased by 13 million, or 28 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily attributable to a significant decrease in average balances in our non-recourse asset-backed debt, a reduction in our weighted average interest rate as a result of a partial repayment of our outstanding mezzanine debt and a decrease in loan fees as a result of committed debt reductions. 
 Interest expense decreased by 73 million, or 42 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily attributable to a significant decrease in average balances in our non-recourse asset-backed debt and a decrease in loan fees as a result of committed debt reductions. 
 Other Income Net 
 Other income net increased by 3 million, or 15 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Other income net decreased by 30 million, or 38 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily attributable to an 8 million change in fair value

 adjustments on marketable securities and to 40 million lower interest income due to a reduction in the average cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash balances. The decrease was partially offset by the 14 million gain from the deconsolidation of Mainstay. 
 Income Tax Expense 
 Income tax expense changed by a nominal amount for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Overview 
 Our principal sources of liquidity have historically consisted of cash generated from our operations and from financing activities. As of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of 829 million, restricted cash of 225 million, and marketable securities of 8 million. The decrease in our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balance of 231 million as compared to December 31, 2023 resulted primarily from operating losses and an increase in real estate inventory. The decrease in our restricted cash balance of 316 million as compared to December 31, 2023 was primarily a result of the increase in real estate inventory and 7 million net principal payments on non-recourse asset-backed debt. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company had total outstanding balances on our asset-backed debt of 2.1 billion and aggregate principal outstanding from convertible senior notes of 381 million. In addition, we had undrawn borrowing capacity of 4.9 billion under our non-recourse asset-backed debt facilities (as described further below), of which 142 million was committed. 
 During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company entered into separate, privately negotiated transactions to repurchase a portion of the outstanding 2026 Notes Repurchased 2026 Notes ). We repurchased approximately 597 million in aggregate principal amount of our 2026 Notes as further described in Part I Item 1. Financial Statements Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements Note 5. Credit Facilities and Long-Term Debt Convertible Senior Notes in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. As market conditions warrant, we may, from time to time, repurchase additional outstanding debt securities in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions, by tender offer, by exchange transaction or otherwise. Such repurchases, if any, will be upon such terms and at such prices as we may determine, and will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity and other factors and may be commenced or suspended at any time. The amounts involved and total consideration paid may be material. 
 In May 2024, the Company entered into an at-the-market equity offering sales agreement (the ATM Agreement with Barclays Capital Inc. and Virtu Americas LLC, as sales agents (the "Agents"), pursuant to which the Company may offer and sell, from time to time, through the Agents, shares of the Company s common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to 200 million. Under the ATM Agreement, the Agents may sell shares by any method deemed to be an at-the-market offering. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, there was no activity pursuant to the ATM Agreement. 
 We have incurred losses from inception through September 30, 2024, with the exception of net income during the three months ended March 31, 2022 and three months ended June 30, 2023, and we expect to incur additional losses in the future. Our ability to service our debt and fund working capital, business operations and capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate cash from operating activities, which is subject to our future operating success, and ability to obtain inventory acquisition financing on reasonable terms, which is subject to factors beyond our control, including potential economic recession, rising interest rates, inflation and general economic, political and financial market conditions. 
 Our working capital requirements may increase should our inventory balance increase. We believe our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, together with cash we expect to generate from future operations and borrowings, will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for a period of at least 12 months from the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

 Debt and Financing Arrangements 
 Our financing activities include: short-term borrowings under our asset-backed senior revolving credit facilities; the issuance of long-term asset-backed senior term debt, asset-backed mezzanine term debt, and convertible debt; and new issuances of equity. Historically, we have required access to external financing resources in order to fund growth, expansion into new markets and strategic initiatives and we expect this to continue in the future. Our access to capital markets can be impacted by factors outside our control, including economic conditions. 
 We primarily use non-recourse asset-backed debt, consisting of asset-backed senior debt facilities and asset-backed mezzanine term debt facilities, to provide financing for our real estate inventory purchases and renovations. Our business is capital intensive and maintaining adequate liquidity and capital resources is needed as we continue to scale and accumulate additional inventory. We intend to actively manage our relationships with multiple financial institutions and seek to optimize duration, flexibility, efficiency and cost of funds, but there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain sufficient capital for our business or to do so on acceptable financial and other terms. 
 Our asset-backed facilities are each collateralized by a specified pool of assets, consisting of real estate inventory, restricted cash and equity interests in certain consolidated subsidiaries of Opendoor that directly or indirectly own our real estate inventory. The terms of our inventory financing facilities require an Opendoor subsidiary to comply with customary financial covenants, such as maintaining certain levels of liquidity, tangible net worth or leverage (ratio of debt to tangible net worth). As of September 30, 2024, the Company was in compliance with all financial covenants. 
 Our property financing subsidiaries assets and credit generally are not available to satisfy the debts and other obligations of any other Opendoor entities. Our asset-backed debt is non-recourse to Opendoor and our subsidiaries that are not party to the relevant financing arrangements, except for limited guarantees provided by an Opendoor subsidiary for certain obligations in situations involving bad acts by an Opendoor entity and certain other limited circumstances. 
 Our asset-backed senior debt facilities generally provide for advance rates of 75 to 90 against our cost basis in the underlying properties upon acquisition. Our mezzanine term facilities may finance up to 95 to 100 of our cost basis in the underlying properties upon acquisition. The maximum initial advance rates vary by facility and generally decrease on a fixed timeline that varies by facility based on the length of time a given property has been financed and other facility-specific adjustments, including adjustments based on collateral performance. 
 At times, we may be required to keep amounts in restricted cash accounts to collateralize our asset-backed term debt facilities if the property borrowing base is insufficient to satisfy the borrowing base requirements. These amounts may fluctuate due to seasonality, timing of property acquisitions and resales, and the outstanding loan balances under our asset-backed term debt facilities.

 Net Cash (Used in) Provided by Operating Activities 
 Net cash (used in) provided by operating activities was (515) million and 2.9 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, cash used in operating activities was primarily driven by the 422 million increase in real estate inventory and our net loss, net of non-cash items, of 98 million. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, cash provided by operating activities was primarily driven by the 3.1 billion decrease in real estate inventory, partially offset by our net loss, net of non-cash items, of 153 million. 
 Net Cash Provided by Investing Activities 
 Net cash provided by investing activities was 31 million and 48 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, cash provided by investing activities primarily consisted of a decrease in marketable securities of 55 million, partially offset by an 22 million increase in property and equipment principally related to the capitalization of internally developed software.

 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 Discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, revenue, and expenses at the date of the financial statements. Generally, we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions in accordance with GAAP that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 
 We consider an accounting judgment, estimate or assumption to be critical when (1) the estimate or assumption is complex in nature or requires a high degree of judgment and (2) the use of different judgments, estimates and assumptions could have a material impact on the condensed consolidated financial statements. Based on this definition, critical accounting policies and estimates are discussed in Part II Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. There have been no significant changes to these critical accounting estimates during the first nine months of 2024. In addition, we have other key accounting policies and estimates that are described in Part I Item 1. Financial Statements Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements Note 1. Description of Business and Accounting Policies in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 We are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business. These risks primarily consist of fluctuations in interest rates and exposure to inflationary pressures. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 We are subject to market risk by way of changes in interest rates on borrowings under our inventory financing facilities. As of September 30, 2024, we had total outstanding balances on our asset-backed debt of 2.1 billion, 86 of which was based on a fixed rate with an average duration of 1.9 years and the remaining 14 of which was based on a floating rate. Total property financing interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 88 million, of which 81 million was fixed and 7 million was floating. As of September 30, 2024 we had outstanding borrowings of 293 million which bear interest at floating benchmark reference rates based on the secured overnight financing rate SOFR ), plus an applicable margin. Accordingly, fluctuations in market interest rates may increase or decrease our interest expense. We may use interest rate cap derivatives, interest rate swaps or other interest rate hedging instruments to economically hedge and manage interest rate risk with respect to our variable floating rate debt. Many of our floating rate debt facilities also have benchmark rate floors. Assuming no change in the outstanding borrowings on our credit facilities, we estimate that a one percentage point increase in applicable benchmark rates would increase our annual interest expense by approximately 3 million as of September 30, 2024. 
 Inflation Risk 
 We believe the inflation experienced in recent years has impacted the cost of goods and services that we consume, such as labor and materials costs for home repairs. We endeavor to offset these impacts in our business through appropriately considering them in our pricing and operational models. However, if our costs were to become subject to significant incremental inflationary pressure, we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs by adjusting our operational model or our pricing methodology. Our inability to do so could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
 In addition, in response to ongoing inflationary pressures in the U.S., the Federal Reserve has implemented a number of increases to the federal funds rate since 2022, which, despite the Federal Reserve s 50 basis point cut in September 2024, remains elevated compared to historical levels. See Part I Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Current Housing Environment for a discussion of the impact of the increased federal funds rate on mortgage interest rates and our business. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls 
 In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs. 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Accounting Officer (who the Board has determined performs the functions of the Company s principal financial officer and principal accounting officer as of the date of the filing of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q), evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act), as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based on the evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Accounting Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective at the reasonable assurance level as of September 30, 2024. The Board has determined that, as of the date following the filing of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the Company s Chief Financial Officer, Selim F. Freiha, will be the Company s principal financial officer and principal accounting officer.

Pursuant to The Ending Forced Arbitration of Sexual Assault and Sexual Harassment Act, however, the parties agree that only a court shall determine whether a claim relates to a sexual assault dispute or a sexual harassment dispute (as those terms are defined in the statute) and is therefore not subject to arbitration. Except in the case of claims that may relate to a sexual harassment dispute or sexual assault dispute, the power and authority to determine arbitrability is hereby expressly delegated to the appointed arbitrator and not to any judge or court to the fullest extent allowed by law.

 13. Waiver . The failure of either party hereto at any time to enforce performance by the other party of any provision of this Agreement shall in no way affect such party s rights thereafter to enforce the same, nor shall the waiver by either party of any breach of any provision hereof be deemed to be a waiver by such party of any other breach of the same or any other provision hereof.

 a. Executive s termination of employment on the Separation Date will constitute Executive s separation from service within the meaning of Code Section 409A, and the final regulations and any guidance promulgated thereunder Section 409A ). This Agreement is not intended to provide for any deferral of compensation subject to Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code ). To the extent applicable, this Agreement shall be interpreted in accordance with Code Section 409A and Department of Treasury regulations and other interpretive guidance issued thereunder consistent with the foregoing intention. For purposes of Section 409A of the Code, any right to a series of installment payments under this Agreement shall be treated as a right to a series of separate payments.

 11 

payments shall be made on or before the last day of Executive s taxable year following the taxable year in which the expense occurred. 
 d. In the event that the amounts payable under this Agreement constitute non-qualified deferred compensation subject to Section 409A of the Code and the timing of the delivery of Executive s Release could cause such amounts to be paid in one or another taxable year, then notwithstanding the payment timing set forth in such sections, such amounts shall not be payable until the later of (i) the payment date specified in such section or (ii) the first business day of the taxable year following the Separation Date. 
 e. In no event whatsoever shall the Company be liable for any taxes, penalties or interest that may be imposed on Executive pursuant to Section 409A or under any other similar provision of state tax law, including but not limited to, damages for failing to comply with Section 409A and or any other similar provision of state tax law.
