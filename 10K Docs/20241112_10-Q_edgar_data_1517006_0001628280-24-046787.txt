 2024 Guidance Update 
 
 On October 9, 2024, Gatos Silver announced improved annual production and cost guidance for 2024 as described below. 
 
 As a result of continued strong production performance, Gatos Silver increased its full year 2024 guidance for silver production and silver equivalent production. Silver production is now expected to be between 9.2 million and 9.7 million ounces compared with original guidance of 8.4 million to 9.2 million ounces. This represents an increase of 10 at the low end of the range and 5 at the high end. Silver equivalent production is now expected to be between 14.7 million and 15.5 million ounces, compared with original guidance of 13.5 million to 15.0 million silver equivalent ounces. This represents an increase of 9 at the low end of the range and 3 at the high end. 
 
 Based on current mine plan sequencing at CLG, the Company expects full year zinc, lead and gold production to be near the high end of the original guidance range of 61 million to 69 million pounds, 40 million to 46 million pounds and 4.5 thousand to 5.5 thousand ounces, respectively. 
 
 The Company now expects full year by-product AISC 1 to be between 8.50 and 10.00 per ounce of payable silver compared to the original guidance range of 9.50 to 11.50 per ounce of payable silver. This represents a decrease of 11 at the low end of the range and 13 at the high end. Full year co-product AISC 1 is expected to remain within our original guidance ranges of 14.00 to 16.00 per ounce of payable silver equivalent. 
 
 The Company remains on track to meet sustaining capital expenditure guidance at CLG of 45 million and total exploration and resource development drilling expenditures of 18 million in 2024.

 Cost of sales for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 31.2 million, compared to 31.4 million for the same period in 2023 despite the higher sales volumes. Co-product cash cost 1 per ounce of payable silver equivalent decreased to 12.13 due to higher payable silver, zinc, lead and gold volumes, and lower cash costs. By-product cash cost 1 per ounce of payable silver decreased to 3.69 due to higher payable silver volumes, lower cash costs and significantly higher contributions from by-product credits. 
 
 Royalties and duties expense 
 
 Royalties and duties expense increased by 0.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023 due to increased concentrate sales and mining duties during the current year period. 
 
 General and administrative expenses 
 
 General and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024, were 0.4 million lower as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, due to a 0.7 million reduction in audit and consulting fees, partly offset by 0.3 million increase in management fees in the current period. 
 
 Depreciation, depletion and amortization 
 
 Depreciation, depletion, and amortization expense increased by approximately 7 primarily due to the increase in ore mined, offset by the impact of the increase in mineral reserves and the extension of life of mine, effective July 1, 2024. 
 
 Exploration 
 
 Exploration expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was 0.6 million higher compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to increased greenfields exploration. In the third quarter of 2024, exploration drilling focused on CLG s Central Deeps and the broader district s Portigue o and San Luis zones, as well as early-stage generative work at Lince and Los Veranos in the Los Gatos district.

 Other expense (income) 
 
 Other income of 1.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 is largely consistent with other income of 0.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Income tax expense (recovery) 
 
 Income tax expense of 13.9 million was recorded for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to an income tax recovery of 0.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in income tax expense was primarily due to higher taxable income for the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Net income 
 
 The LGJV had net income of 25.7 million compared to 15.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in net income was primarily due to an increase in revenue and decrease in general and administrative expenses, partly offset by higher royalties and duties, exploration expense, depreciation, depletion and amortization and income tax expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period of 2023. 
 
 Sustaining capital 
 
 Sustaining capital expenditures primarily consisted of 6.6 million of mine development and 6.3 million of infrastructure and equipment, including 3.0 million for the overhaul of mining equipment, 0.8 million for construction of mine dewatering infrastructure, 0.4 million for mine facilities, 0.3 million of mine ventilation expenditures, and 1.8 million of costs for other equipment and infrastructure. During the three months ended September 30, 2023, sustaining capital expenditures primarily consisted of 5.0 million of mine development, 4.0 million of infrastructure and equipment, including construction of the fluorine leach plant of 0.3 million, construction of mine dewatering infrastructure of 0.5 million, the construction of underground power distribution of 0.5 million, the construction of a ventilation raise of 0.2 million, and mining equipment of 2.1 million. 
 
 Resource development drilling expenditures 
 
 Resource development drilling expenditures for the three months ended September 30, 2024, were lower compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to reduced resource conversion drilling in the SE Deeps zone.

 1,307 (13,577) Total Revenue 
 260,255 195,162 
 
 Total revenue increased by 33 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily as a result of increases in metal prices and an increase in payable metals sold. Sales volumes of payable silver, zinc, lead and gold increased by 8 , 22 , 19 and 9 , respectively. The average realized prices of silver, zinc and gold increased by 8 , 18 and 18 , respectively, and the average realized lead price decreased by 6 . Treatment and refining charges decreased by 24 due to lower treatment and refining rates and a positive provisional revenue adjustment. Provisional revenue adjustments account for commodity price fluctuations in concentrate sales that are still subject to final settlement.

Table of Contents 

 Cost of sales 
 
 Cost of sales increased by 13 primarily due to a 21 increase in the tonnage of the concentrate sold and the associated higher mining and processing costs as a result of an 11 increase in mill throughput. Cost of sales was further impacted by the operating costs of the fluorine leaching plant commissioned in July 2023. Co-product cash cost 1 per ounce of payable silver equivalent decreased to 11.86 due to higher sales volumes of silver, zinc, lead and gold, partly offset by higher cash costs. By-product cash cost 1 per ounce of payable silver decreased to 3.67 as higher cash costs were offset by a higher contribution from by-products and higher payable silver volumes. 
 
 Royalties and duties expense 
 
 Royalties and duties expense increased by 0.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, due to increased concentrate sales and mining duties during the current year period. 
 
 General and administrative expenses 
 
 General and administrative expenses decreased by 0.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 due to a 0.7 million reduction in audit and consulting fees, a 0.3 million reduction in insurance premiums and a 0.2 million reduction in various other expenses, partly offset by an 0.8 million increase in management fees. 
 
 Depreciation, depletion and amortization expense 
 
 Depreciation, depletion, and amortization expense decreased by 0.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, mostly due to the impact of the increase in mineral reserves and the extension of life of mine effective July 1, 2024, partly offset by depreciation of the fluorine leach plant commissioned in July 2023 and increased mining rates resulting in higher depletion. 
 
 Exploration expense 
 
 Exploration expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was 2.5 million higher compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to increased exploration drilling at the Portigue o, San Luis and Central Deeps targets. 
 
 Other (income) expense 
 
 Other expense was 1.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to other income of 1.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This change is primarily due to a foreign exchange gain of 2.0 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, a 1.0 million positive adjustment on VAT receivable balances, and 0.4 million increase in interest expense during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Income tax expense (recovery) 
 
 Income tax expense of 31.2 million was recorded for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to income tax expense of 9.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in income tax expense was primarily due to higher taxable income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Net income 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the LGJV had net income of 56.4 million compared to 28.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in net income was primarily due to an increase in revenue and a decrease in general and administrative expenses and depreciation, depletion and amortization expense, partly offset by higher cost of sales, royalties and duties, exploration, income tax expense and other expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to other income in the same period of 2023.

 Cash provided by operating activities was 150.0 million and 103.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The 46.2 million increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to the increase in revenues, partly offset by increases in cost of sales, royalties and duties, and exploration expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the prior year period. 
 
 Cash used by investing activities was 41.1 million and 41.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, 8.9 million was incurred on property, plant and equipment expenditures and 32.3 million on mine development expenditures, of which 7.2 million was associated with capitalized development drilling. During the nine months ended September 30 2023, 13.5 million was incurred on property, plant and equipment expenditures and 27.2 million on mine development expenditures, of which 10.5 million was associated with capitalized development drilling. 
 
 Free cash flow 1 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was 108.8 million, compared to 62.6 million in the same period in 2023 primarily due to higher cash flow provided by operating activities. 
 
 Cash used by financing activities was 109.3 million and 50.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase in cash used by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was due to 95.0 million of capital distributions and 14.2 million of dividends, made to the LGJV partners during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 50.0 million of capital distributions made to the LGJV partners during the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

The increase in the Company's cash and cash equivalents of 61.2 million was primarily due to capital distributions and dividends of 76.4 million received from the LGJV, partly offset by an increase in general and administrative expenses. 
 
 The Company manages liquidity risk through its capital structure and the Credit Facility. At September 30, 2024, the Company's borrowing capacity on the Credit Facility is 50.0 million with an accordion feature providing up to an additional 50.0 million, subject to certain conditions. If completed, the Merger will trigger customary change of control provisions in the Credit Facility pursuant to which the Company would be required to prepay in full all amounts outstanding under the facility unless the change in control is approved by the lenders. We continue to remain compliant with covenants and, subject to the foregoing, do not currently anticipate any events or circumstances that would impact our ability to access funds available on the Credit Facility. 
 
 On October 31, 2024, the Company s cash and cash equivalents were 114.8 million before receipt of a capital distribution of 28.0 million from the LGJV on November 7, 2024.

Contractual Obligations 
 
 There have been no material changes from the contractual obligations described in the 2023 10-K. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 
 There have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates described in the 2023 10-K. 
 
 Please refer to Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in our condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Report and the 2023 10-K for discussion of our critical accounting policies and estimates. 

Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 
 
 The Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the JOBS Act permits us, as an emerging growth company, to take advantage of an extended transition period to comply with new or revised accounting standards applicable to public companies. We have elected to opt out of this provision and, as a result, we will comply with new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for public companies that are not emerging growth companies. The decision to opt out of the extended transition period under the JOBS Act is irrevocable. 

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 
 We use certain measures that are not defined by GAAP to evaluate various aspects of our business. These non-GAAP financial measures are intended to provide additional information only and do not have any standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. The measures are not necessarily indicative of operating profit or cash flow from operations as determined under GAAP. 
 
 Cash Costs and All-In Sustaining Costs 
 
 Cash costs and AISC are non-GAAP measures. AISC was calculated based on guidance provided by the World Gold Council (the "WGC ). The WGC is not a regulatory industry organization and does not have the authority to develop accounting standards for disclosure requirements. Other mining companies may calculate AISC differently as a result of differences in underlying accounting principles and policies applied, as well as definitional differences of sustaining versus expansionary (i.e., non-sustaining) capital expenditures based upon each company s internal policies. Current GAAP measures used in the mining industry, such as cost of sales, do not capture all of the expenditures incurred to discover, develop and sustain production. Therefore, we believe that cash costs and AISC are non-GAAP measures that provide additional information to management, investors and analysts that aid in the understanding of the economics of the Company s operations and performance compared to other producers and provides investors visibility by better defining the total costs associated with production. 
 
 Cash costs include all direct and indirect operating cash costs related directly to the physical activities of producing metals, including mining, processing and other plant costs, treatment and refining costs, general and administrative costs, royalties and duties and mining production taxes. AISC includes total production cash costs incurred at the LGJV s mining operations plus sustaining capital expenditures. The Company believes this measure represents the total sustainable costs of producing silver from current operations and provides additional information of the LGJV s operational performance and ability to generate cash flows. As the measure seeks to reflect the full cost of silver production from current operations, new project and expansionary capital at current operations are not included. Certain cash expenditures such as new project spending, tax payments, dividends, and financing costs are not included.

Adjusted Net Income - Gatos Silver 
 
 Management uses adjusted net income, which excludes costs associated with the strategic review resulting in the proposed Merger with First Majestic, to evaluate the Company s operating performance. The Company believes the use of adjusted net income reflects the underlying operating performance of our business and allows investors and analysts to compare results of the Company to similar results of other mining companies. Management s determination of the components of adjusted net income are evaluated periodically and is based, in part, on a review of non-GAAP financial measures used by mining industry analysts. Adjusted net income does not represent, and should not be considered an alternative to, net income as determined under GAAP. Other companies may calculate adjusted net income differently and those calculations may not be comparable to our presentation. Adjusted net income is reconciled to net income in the following table:

EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA - Gatos Silver and LGJV 
 
 Management uses EBITDA to evaluate the Company s operating performance, to plan and forecast its operations, and assess leverage levels and liquidity measures. EBITDA is defined as net income adjusted for interest expense, interest income, income tax expense and depreciation, depletion and amortization expense. 
 
 Management also uses adjusted EBITDA to evaluate the Company s ongoing operating performance, without impact of costs associated with the strategic review resulting in the proposed Merger with First Majestic. The Company believes the use of EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA reflects the underlying operating performance of our core mining business and allows investors and analysts to compare results of the Company to similar results of other mining companies. 
 
 EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA do not represent, and should not be considered an alternative to, net income (loss) or cash flow from operations as determined under GAAP. Other companies may calculate adjusted EBITDA differently and those calculations may not be comparable to our presentation. The table below reconciles the Company's EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA, and each non-GAAP measure, to the Company's net income:

 Free Cash Flow - Gatos Silver and LGJV 
 
 Management uses free cash flow as a non-GAAP measure to analyze cash flows generated from operations. Free cash flow is cash p rovided by (used in) operating activities less cash flow (used in) from investing activities as presented on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The Company believes free cash flow is also useful for investors as one of the bases for comparing the Company s performance with its competitors. Although free cash flow and similar measures are frequently used as measures of cash flows generated from operations by other companies, the Company s calculation of free cash flow is not necessarily comparable to such other similarly titled captions of other companies. 
 
 The following table sets forth a reconciliation of free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, to net cash provided by operating activities, which the Company be lieves to be the GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to free cash flow.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
 
 We are a "smaller reporting company" as defined under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), and are not required to provide disclosure pursuant to this Item.

 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 We have established disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including our principal executive and principal financial officers as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 
 Our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2024, due to the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting described in the 2023 10-K. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 There have not been any changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting. 
 
 Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls 
 
 Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all errors and fraud. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. Further, the design of a control system must reflect resource constraints, which require management to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by management s override of the control. 
 
 The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.

 PART II - OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 
 For a description of Legal Proceedings see Note 9. Commitments, Contingencies and Guarantees in Part I, Item 1. of this Report, which is incorporated by reference herein. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 
 Factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those in this Report include, but are not limited to, any of the risks described in the 2023 10-K. Any of these factors could result in a significant or material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. Additional risk factors not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also adversely affect us. As of the date of this Report, there have been no material changes to the risk factors disclosed in the 2023 10-K, except the following: 
 
 Risks Relating to the Merger 
 
 The Merger is subject to various closing conditions, including regulatory and stockholder/shareholder approvals as well as other uncertainties, and there can be no assurances as to whether and when it may be completed. 
 
 Closing of the Merger is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of a number of conditions specified in the Merger Agreement, and it is possible that such conditions may prevent, delay or otherwise materially adversely affect the completion of the Merger. These conditions include, among other things: (1) receipt of the required approval by the Company s stockholders; (2) receipt of the required approval by First Majestic s shareholders; (3) First Majestic s Registration Statement on Form F-4 having been declared effective by the SEC; (4) the accuracy of representations and warranties under the Merger Agreement (subject to the materiality standards set forth in the Merger Agreement) and the performance of the obligations of the Company and First Majestic under the Merger Agreement in all material respects; (5) the absence of any adverse law or order prohibiting or making illegal the consummation of the Merger; (6) receipt of approvals or clearances pursuant to Mexico s antitrust law; (7) the First Majestic common shares issuable in the Merger having been approved for listing on the NYSE, subject to official notice of issuance, and conditionally approved or authorized for listing on the Toronto Stock Exchange (the TSX ), subject to customary listing requirements; (8) absence of a material adverse effect since the signing of the Merger Agreement; and (9) receipt of an opinion from counsel to the effect that, on the basis of facts, representations and assumptions set forth or referred to in such opinion, the Merger qualifies as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. 
 
 The governmental authorities from which authorizations are required have broad discretion in administering the governing laws and regulations and may take into account various facts and circumstances in their consideration of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. These governmental authorities may initiate proceedings or otherwise seek to prevent the Merger. As a condition to the authorization of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, these governmental authorities may also impose requirements, limitations or costs, require divestitures or place restrictions on the conduct of First Majestic s business after the combination of First Majestic and the Company following receipt of final antitrust approval. The Company s special meeting of stockholders may take place before the required regulatory approvals have been obtained and before all conditions to such approvals, if any, are known. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Merger is approved by the Company s stockholders, the Company may not be required to seek further approval from its stockholders. 
 
 The Company cannot provide any assurance that all required consents and approvals will be obtained or that all closing conditions will otherwise be satisfied (or waived, if applicable), and, if all required consents and approvals are obtained and all closing conditions are satisfied (or waived, if applicable), the Company cannot provide any assurance as to the terms, conditions and timing of such consents and approvals or the timing of the completion of the Merger. Many of the conditions to completion of the Merger are not within either the Company s or First Majestic s control, and neither company can predict when or if these conditions will be satisfied (or waived, if applicable). Any delay in completing the Merger could cause the Company and/or First Majestic not to realize some or all of the benefits that each expects to achieve if the Merger is successfully completed within the expected timeframe and an extended timeframe could increase the chance that an adverse event occurs with respect to the Company or First Majestic. 
 
 Failure to complete the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement could negatively impact the price of the Company s common stock, and its future business and financial results. 
 
 If the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement are not completed for any reason, the Company s ongoing business may be materially and adversely affected and the Company would be subject to a number of risks, including, but not limited to, the following: 
 37 

Table of Contents 

 The Company may experience negative reactions from the financial markets, including negative impacts on trading prices of the Company s common stock, and from the Company s employees and suppliers; and 
 The Company will be required to pay First Majestic a termination payment of 28.0 million if the Merger Agreement is terminated in certain circumstances. 
 
 In addition, the Company could be subject to litigation related to any failure to complete the acquisition or related to any proceeding to specifically enforce the Company s performance obligations under the Merger Agreement. 
 
 If any of these risks materialize, they may materially and adversely affect the Company s business, financial condition, financial results and stock prices. 
 
 Because the exchange ratio is fixed and the market price of First Majestic common shares has fluctuated and will continue to fluctuate, the Company s stockholders cannot be sure of the market value of the merger consideration they will receive in the Merger prior to the closing of the Merger. 
 
 At the effective time of the Merger, each share of the Company s common stock that is outstanding immediately prior to the effective time (excluding Company common stock to be cancelled as described in the Merger Agreement) will be converted into the right to receive 2.55 First Majestic common shares. Because the exchange ratio is fixed, the value of the merger consideration will depend on the market price of First Majestic common shares at the effective time of the Merger. The market price of First Majestic common shares has fluctuated since the date of the announcement of the Merger and is expected to continue to fluctuate until the closing date of the Merger, which could occur a considerable amount of time after the Merger Agreement was entered into or any other time. Changes in the price of First Majestic common shares may result from a variety of factors, including, among others, general market and economic conditions, changes in First Majestic s and the Company s respective businesses, operations and prospects, risks inherent in their respective businesses, changes in market assessments of the likelihood that the proposed transaction will be completed and/or the value that may be generated by the proposed transaction and changes with respect to expectations regarding the timing of the proposed transaction and regulatory considerations. Many of these factors are beyond the Company s control. If the price of First Majestic common shares declines between the date the Merger Agreement was signed and the date of the Company s special meeting of stockholders to approve the Merger and the consummation of the Merger, including for any of the reasons described above, the Company s stockholders will receive First Majestic common shares that have a market value upon the consummation of the Merger that is less than the market value of such shares calculated pursuant to the exchange ratio on the date the Merger Agreement was signed or on the date of the Company s special meeting of stockholders to approve the Merger, respectively. 
 
 The First Majestic common shares to be received by the Company s stockholders at the effective time of the Merger will provide the Company s stockholders different rights from the rights they had as holders of shares of the Company s common stock. 
 
 At the effective time of the Merger, the Company s stockholders will no longer be stockholders of the Company s common stock but will instead have the right to become shareholders of First Majestic. The rights of former Company stockholders in their capacities as stockholders will then be governed by the laws of British Columbia, Canada and by the terms of First Majestic s articles, which are in some respects materially different from the laws of Delaware and the terms of the Company s certificate of incorporation and bylaws, which currently govern the rights of the Company s stockholders. 
 
 After First Majestic s combination with the Company, First Majestic may fail to realize the projected benefits of the Merger, which could adversely affect the value of First Majestic common shares. 
 
 First Majestic and the Company have operated and, absent closing of the Merger, will continue to operate independently. The success of First Majestic s combination with the Company will depend, in part, on First Majestic s ability to realize the anticipated benefits from combining the businesses of the Company and First Majestic following the Merger, including operational and other synergies that the Company believes the combined company will achieve. The anticipated benefits of First Majestic s combination with the Company may not be realized fully or at all, may take longer to realize than expected or could have other adverse effects that the Company does not currently foresee. The integration process may result in the loss of key employees, the disruption of ongoing businesses or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies. There could be potential unknown liabilities and unforeseen expenses associated with the transaction that were not discovered in the course of performing due diligence. Coordinating certain aspects of the operations and personnel of First Majestic with the Company after the combination of First Majestic and the Company will involve operational, technological and personnel-related challenges. Additionally, the integration will require significant time and focus from management following the combination which may disrupt the business of the combined company. First Majestic s production estimates and capital and operating cost estimates relating to the combined company following the transaction are based on certain assumptions and are inherently subject to significant uncertainties. Actual results for the combined company may differ from current estimates and assumptions, and these differences may be material. Experience from actual mining or processing operations may identify new or unexpected conditions which could reduce production below, and/or increase capital and/or 
 38

 operating costs above, current estimates. If actual results are less favorable than current estimates, the combined company s business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity could be adversely impacted. 
 
 The Company has received demand letters and the Company may be targets of legal claims, securities class actions, derivative lawsuits and other claims which could result in substantial costs and may delay or prevent the Merger from being completed. 
 
 Securities class action lawsuits and derivative lawsuits are often brought against companies that have entered into merger agreements. Even if the lawsuits are without merit, defending against these claims can result in substantial costs and divert management time and resources. The Company has received a number of demand letters alleging that the disclosures contained in the proxy statement/prospectus included in the Registration Statement on Form F-4 filed with the SEC by First Majestic on October 15, 2024 were deficient and demanding that certain corrective disclosures be made (the Demand Letters ). The Company believes the claims asserted in the Demand Letters are without merit but cannot predict the outcome of any such matters. Lawsuits and additional demand letters arising out of the Merger may also be filed or received in the future. The outcome of any such demands and complaints and any litigation ensuing from such demands and complaints cannot be assured, including the amount of fees and costs associated with defending these claims or any other liabilities that may be incurred in connection therewith. Additionally, if a plaintiff is successful in obtaining an injunction prohibiting consummation of the Merger, then that injunction may delay or prevent the Merger from being completed.
