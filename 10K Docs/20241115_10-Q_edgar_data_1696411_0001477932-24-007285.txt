NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS September 30, 2024 as of September 30, 2024 and has not completed its efforts to establish a stabilized source of revenue sufficient to cover operating costs over an extended period of time. Therefore, there is substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. Management anticipates that the Company will be dependent, for the near future, on additional investment capital to fund operating expenses. The Company intends to position itself so that it will be able to raise additional funds through the capital markets. In light of management s efforts, there are no assurances that the Company will be successful in this or any of its endeavors or become financially viable and continue as a going concern.

As a result of the management change, the Company is moving out of the antimicrobial surface protection services business and into the memorialization industry, serving our customers in cemetery and funeral industries. We have not generated revenue to date and intend to generate revenue from our products sales to customers. Our mission is to ensure families are supported during the most difficult time of their lives. We aim to help families move forward from grief to remembrance. We are proud to provide products and solutions to meet the needs of every family. We provide a variety of funeral products including funeral caskets. Funeral caskets come in a wide array of models and are made of several different materials. Metal funeral caskets come in Copper, Stainless Steel, 18 Gauge metal and 20-gauge metal. They come with a variety of popular interiors including velvet, crepe and satin among other fabrics. As for the wooden caskets, they also come in a variety of woods including, but not limited to; Pine, Mahogany, Oak, Cherry, Pecan, Maple, Poplar and Cedar. All of these caskets come with a variety of finishes, a variety of handles (swing bars or stationery, a variety of decorative corners, repositioning beds). Our customers for caskets are funeral homes, funeral suppliers, and casket distributors in the US market. By importing from China, the Company is following a well-worn outsourcing playbook that s upended markets for American-made goods from electronics to bedroom furniture. Our relationship with several factories in China allows us to have priority manufacturing. In addition, our relationship with shippers allows us to have priority shipping at some of the best rates available. We will import 40-foot containers holding 64 caskets apiece and sells them to funeral homes and regional distributors for a fraction of the price. We will be attending industry Trade Shows at the National as well as the State level to increase company visibility and market presence and work to increase market share as well as to stay in contact with our Funeral Home families and customers. In addition, our marketing will include advertising in Funeral industry magazines and journals. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENDITURES We have not incurred any research expenditures since our incorporation. BANKRUPTCY OR SIMILAR PROCEEDINGS There has been no bankruptcy, receivership or similar proceeding. COMPLIANCE WITH GOVERNMENT REGULATION We will be required to comply with all regulations, rules and directives of governmental authorities and agencies applicable to the services provided in any facility in any jurisdiction which we would conduct activities. FACILITIES Our previously leased office is located at 422 Richards Street, Unit 170, Vancouver, BC V6B 2Z4. Our current office, effective as of June 22, 2023, is 304 South Jones Blvd. #7356, Las Vegas, Nevada 89107. Our telephone number is (888) 998-1888. EMPLOYEES AND EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENTS We have no employees as of the date of this prospectus. Our sole officer and director, Chris Brown currently devotes approximately 20 hours per week to company matters. After receiving funding, Chris Brown plans to devote as much time to the operation of the Company as he determines is necessary for him to manage the affairs of the Company. As our business and operations increase, we will assess the need for full time management and administrative support personnel. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS There are no pending legal proceedings to which the Company is a party or in which any director, officer or affiliate of the Company, any owner of record or beneficially of more than 5 of any class of voting securities of the Company, or security holder is a party adverse to the Company or has a material interest adverse to the Company. 15 Table of Contents MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS This section includes a number of forward-looking statements that reflect our current views regarding the future events and financial performance of Crona Corp. We qualify as an emerging growth company under the JOBS Act. As a result, we are permitted to, and intend to, rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements. For so long as we are an emerging growth company, we will not be required to: Have an auditor report on our internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act; Comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor s report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements (i.e., an auditor discussion and analysis) unless the SEC determines that the application of such additional requirements is necessary or appropriate in the public interest, after considering protection of investors, and whether the action will promote efficiency, competition and capital formation; Submit certain executive compensation on matters to shareholder advisory votes, such as say-on-pay and say-on-frequency; Disclose certain executive compensation related items such as the correlation between executive compensation and performance and comparisons of the CEO s compensation to median employee compensation. In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period. Our financial statements may therefore not be comparable to those of companies that comply with such new or revised accounting standards.
