(the Reverse Stock Split of the Company s shares of common stock, par value per share (the common stock ). Such amendment and ratio were previously approved by the board of directors. Under Nevada Revised Statutes Section 78.207, stockholder approval of the Reverse Stock Split was not required because (i) both the number of authorized shares of the common stock and the number of issued and outstanding shares of the common stock were proportionally reduced as a result of the Reverse Stock Split; (ii) the Reverse Stock Split did not adversely affect any other class of stock of the Company; and (iii) the Company did not pay money or issue scrip to stockholders who would otherwise be entitled to receive a fractional share as a result of the Reverse Stock Split. As a result of the Reverse Stock Split, which was effective September 6, 2023, every ten shares of the Company s pre-reverse split outstanding common stock were combined and reclassified into one share of common stock. Proportionate voting rights and other rights of common stockholders were not affected by the Reverse Stock Split. Any fractional shares of common stock resulting from the Reverse Stock Split were rounded up to the nearest whole share. All stock options outstanding and common stock reserved for issuance under the Company s equity incentive plans outstanding immediately prior to the Reverse Stock Split were adjusted by dividing the number of affected shares of common stock by ten and, as applicable, multiplying the exercise price by ten. All share numbers, share prices, exercise prices and per share amounts have been adjusted, on a retroactive basis to reflect this 1-for-10 Reverse Stock Split.

The Note had an original issue discount of sixteen percent resulting in gross proceeds of million. The Note was sold pursuant to the terms of a Securities Purchase Agreement, dated November 2, 2021 (the SPA ), between the Company and the investor in the Note (the Investor ). 

The Note was issued on November 8, 2021, pursuant to an indenture dated November 2, 2021 between us and Wilmington Savings Fund Society, FSB, as trustee (the Base Indenture ), as supplemented by a first supplemental indenture thereto, dated November 2, 2021, relating to the Note (the First Supplemental Indenture and the Base Indenture as supplemented by the First Supplemental Indenture, the First Indenture ). The terms of the Note include those provided in the First Indenture and those made part of the First Indenture by reference to the Trust Indenture Act.

Additionally, The Company determined that the parties obligation to exchange the remaining million of outstanding principal balances subject to the Series A Exchanges for shares of Series A Preferred Stock in the Final Series A Exchange represents an embedded conversion feature that does not require bifurcation and separate valuation because it would not meet the definition of a derivative, if freestanding, under ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging ASC 815 , as net settlement could not be achieved.

Second Exchange Agreement 

Under the terms of the First Exchange Agreement, a final closing was to be held upon which the Investor was to exchange an additional million of principal of the Note into shares of Series A Preferred Stock (the Unissued Series A Preferred Stock which shares of Unissued Series A Preferred Stock were convertible into shares of common stock, in accordance with the terms of the Series A Certificate of Designations. 

On November 27, 2023, the Company entered into an Exchange Agreement (the Second Exchange Agreement with the Investor under which the Company and the Investor agreed to exchange (the Series B Exchange ), (i) all of the existing shares of Series A Preferred Stock issued to the Investor in the Initial Series A Exchange, (ii) the right to exchange the shares of Unissued Series A Preferred Stock for an additional million of principal of the Note, and (iii) million of the outstanding principal under the Note for shares of a newly authorized series of preferred stock of the Company designated as Series B Preferred Convertible Stock (the Series B Preferred Stock, and collectively with the Series A Preferred Stock, the Preferred Stock ), the terms of which are set forth in a Certificate of Designations of Rights and Preferences of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock of RYVYL Inc. (the Series B Certificate of Designations ), which the Company filed with the Nevada Secretary of State prior to the initial issuance of any shares of Series B Preferred Stock. The Series B Preferred Stock is further described in Note 10, Convertible Preferred Stock . As additional consideration for the Series B Exchange, the Company has also agreed to make a cash payment to the Investor in the amount of million. As part of the Second Exchange Agreement, the Investor also agreed to forbear from requiring the repayment of the Note (to the extent such repayment obligation arises solely as a result of the occurrence of the maturity date and not with respect to any event of default or redemption rights in the Note or pursuant to the Indenture (as such term is defined in the Second Exchange Agreement)) during the period commencing on November 5, 2024 through, and including, April 5, 2025; and to extend the waiver of payment of interest under the Note through July 1, 2024. 

The Company analyzed the changes made to the Note under the Second Exchange Agreement under ASC 470-50 to determine if extinguishment accounting was applicable. Under ASC 470-50-40-10, a modification or an exchange that adds or eliminates a substantive conversion option as of the conversion date is always considered substantial and requires extinguishment accounting. Since the Second Exchange Agreement eliminated a substantive conversion option (the parties obligation to exchange the remaining 16.7 million of outstanding principal balances subject to the Series A Exchanges for shares of Series A Preferred Stock in the Final Series A Exchange), the Company determined that extinguishment accounting was applicable. In accordance with the extinguishment accounting guidance, the Company recorded a loss on extinguishment of million which represents the difference between (a) the fair value of the modified Note, the fair value of the 55,000 shares of Series B Preferred Stock issued in the Series B Exchange, and the million cash payment made to the Investor, and (b) the carrying amount of the Note, the fair value of the bifurcated embedded derivative immediately prior to giving effect to the Second Exchange Agreement, and the fair value of the existing shares of Series A Preferred Stock issued to the Investor in the Initial Series A Exchange forfeited to the Company by the Investor. 

On November 29, 2023, the Company closed the Series B Exchange, pursuant to which the Company issued to the Investor shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock and paid the Investor a cash payment in the amount of million, in exchange for shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock previously issued to the Investor, the right to exchange the shares of Unissued Series A Preferred Stock for an additional million of principal of the Note, and the reduction of principal of the Note in the aggregate amount of million.

as an advance payment of a portion of the next interest payment, in the estimated amount of , due and payable under the Note on October 1, 2024, agreed to further forbear from requiring the repayment of the Note (to the extent such repayment obligation arises solely as a result of the occurrence of the maturity date and not with respect to any event of default or redemption rights in the Note or pursuant to the Indenture) during the period commencing on April 5, 2025 through, and including, April 5, 2026. The Company analyzed the changes made to the Note under the Forbearance Agreement under ASC 470-60 to determine if the transaction qualified as a troubled debt restructuring. For a debt restructuring to be considered troubled, the debtor must be experiencing financial difficulties and the creditor must have granted a concession. The Company considered the indicators of financial difficulties provided in ASC 470-60 and determined that one or more indicators were present at the time the Forbearance Agreement was entered into, such as the existence of substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. Furthermore, the Company determined that the effective borrowing rate on the Note decreased as a result of the changes made to the Note under the Forbearance Agreement and, as such, the Investor granted a concession on the debt. As a result, the changes made to the Note under the Forbearance Agreement were accounted for as a troubled debt restructuring. However, no restructuring gain or corresponding adjustment to the carrying amount of the Note was recorded because the net carrying amount of the Note at the time the Forbearance Agreement was entered into was less than the total undiscounted future principal and interest payments of the restructured Note. The cash payment made to the Investor in connection with the Forbearance Agreement was treated as a lender fee and expensed as incurred under the troubled debt restructuring model. 

During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Investor converted million of the outstanding principal balance into shares of the Company s common stock at a weighted average conversion price of . In addition, the Company paid the Investor million in January 2022 in exchange for cancellation of million of the outstanding principal balance. During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Investor converted million of the outstanding principal balance into shares of the Company s common stock at a weighted average conversion price of . There were no conversions of outstanding principal into shares of the Company s common stock during the three months ended September 30, 2024.

Change of Control Redemption Right 

In connection with a change of control of the Company, the holder may require us to redeem in cash all, or any portion, of the Notes at a 15 redemption premium to the greater of the face value, the equity value of our Common Stock underlying the Note, and the equity value of the change of control consideration payable to the holder of our Common Stock underlying the Note.

The equity value of the change of control consideration payable to the holder of our common stock underlying the Note is calculated using the aggregate cash consideration and aggregate cash value of any non-cash consideration per share of our common stock to be paid to the holders of our common stock upon the change of control.

Derivative Liability 

The senior convertible note contains embedded derivatives representing certain conversion features, redemption rights, and contingent payments upon the occurrence of certain events of default. The Company determined that these embedded derivatives required bifurcation and separate valuation. 

The Company utilizes a binomial lattice model to value its bifurcated derivatives included in the note. ASC 815 does not permit an issuer to account separately for individual derivative terms and features embedded in hybrid financial instruments that require bifurcation and liability classification as derivative financial instruments. Rather, such terms and features must be combined and fair-valued as a single compound embedded derivative. The Company selected a binomial lattice model to value the compound embedded derivative because it believes this technique is reflective of all significant assumptions that market participants would likely consider in negotiating the transfer of the note. Such assumptions include, among other inputs, stock price volatility, risk-free rates, credit risk assumptions, early redemption and conversion assumptions, and the potential for future adjustment of the conversion price due to triggering events. Additionally, there are other embedded features of the note requiring bifurcation, other than the conversion features, which had no value at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, due to management s estimates of the likelihood of certain events, but that may have value in the future should those estimates change.

In February 2024, the Company transitioned its QuickCard product in North America away from terminal-based to app-based processing. This transition was driven by a change in our banking partner that was prompted by recent changes in the compliance environment and banking regulations impacting certain niche high-risk business verticals, which were the predominant revenue driver for QuickCard. 

As previously disclosed, management s plan to recover the loss of revenues resulting from this product transition included the acceleration of business development efforts to launch the new app-based product in existing and new business verticals. However, due to continuous changes in the regulatory environment and our previous banking relationships, during the second quarter of 2024, management determined that the app-based product may not be a viable long-term solution for certain niche high-risk business verticals and made the decision to terminate the rollout of the app-based product in those business verticals. To address this change, the Company recently introduced a licensing product for its payments processing platform, which will enable it to serve the same customer base in such verticals through a business partner with more suitable banking compliance capabilities. Revenues from the new licensing product are not expected to materialize until early 2025. Due of this strategy shift as well as a reorganization of the Company s business to better align with management s revised strategy, which was executed during the second quarter, the recovery of the loss of revenues resulting from this product transition is now not expected to occur until early 2025. 

The decline in revenues resulting from this product transition has adversely impacted the Company s liquidity in its North America segment in the short term. As a result, management has determined that its cash and cash equivalents in the North America segment as of September 30, 2024, will not be sufficient to fund the segment s operations and capital needs for the next 12 months from the issuance of this Report. Management s intended plan over the next twelve months to address the liquidity shortfall in the North America segment includes, but is not limited to, the following: 

continued execution of its accelerated business development efforts to drive volumes in diversified business verticals with the Company s other products, including the recently launched licensing of the Company s payments processing platform in certain niche high-risk business verticals; 

continued implementation of cost control measures to more effectively manage spending in the North America segment and right sizing the organization, where appropriate; 

the sale of certain noncore assets; and 

repatriation of offshore profits from the Company s European subsidiaries, whose continued accelerated growth and generation of positive cash flow have already provided, and will continue to provide, an immediate and viable short-term source of capital during this product transition (to date, the Company has repatriated approximately 12.8 million from Europe). 

Management has assessed that its intended plan described above, if successfully implemented, is appropriate and sufficient to address the liquidity shortfall in its North America segment and provide funds to cover operations for the next 12 months from the date of the issuance of this Report. However, there can be no guarantee that we will be successful in implementing our plan, that our projections of our future capital needs will prove accurate, or that any additional funding will be sufficient to continue our operations in the North America segment.

Revenue decreased by 4.9 million, or 27.9 , to 12.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 17.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. In the North America segment, revenue decreased 9.7 million, or 77.3 , compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. In the International segment, revenue increased 4.8 million, or 95.8 , compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in revenue was primarily driven by a decrease in processing volume in the North America segment, which decreased from 341.0 million in the quarter ended September 30, 2023, to 170.6 million in the quarter ended September 30, 2024, and is attributable to the previously disclosed impact associated with the Company s QuickCard product transition that began in February 2024. The decrease in revenue in North America was partially offset by an increase in revenue in the International segment that was primarily attributable to continued growth in processing volume, which increased from 517.0 million in the quarter ended September 30, 2023, to 952.3 million in the quarter ended September 30, 2024. The increase in processing volume in the International segment was driven by continued strong growth across multiple verticals, primarily, our Independent Sales Organizations ISO and partnership network, our global payments processing businesses, and banking-as-a-service offering. 

Cost of Revenue 

Cost of revenue decreased by 3.1 million, or 28.2 , to 7.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 10.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. In the North America segment, cost of revenue decreased 6.0 million, or 77.1 , compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. In the International segment, cost of revenue increased 2.9 million, or 94.6 , compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. Cost of revenue primarily consists of various processing fees paid to gateways, as well as commission payments to the ISOs responsible for establishing and maintaining merchant relationships. The decrease in cost of revenue was primarily driven by the decrease in processing volumes in North America, as noted above, partially offset by an increase in processing volumes in the International segment. 

Operating Expenses 

Operating expenses decreased by 1.7 million, or 18.9 , to 7.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 9.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily driven by a decrease in research and development expenses of 0.5 million, as the Company began capitalizing a portion of these costs during the second quarter of 2024, and decreases in general and administrative expenses of 1.6 million and in professional fees of 0.2 million, both due to lower accounting, consulting, and legal fees incurred in 2023 in connection with the Company s restatement of prior period consolidated financial statements. 

Other Income (Expense) 

Other expense increased by 1.5 million, or 238.0 , to 2.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 0.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily driven by a net increase of 1.7 million related to debt discount accretion (+ 3.9 million), changes in fair value of derivative liability (- 6.9 million), and derecognition expense on conversion of convertible debt (+ 1.3 million), all primarily recognized in connection with the Company s restructuring of its convertible note during the second quarter of 2024. Additionally, interest expense increased 0.2 million and legal settlement expense decreased 0.3 million.

Revenue decreased by 2.3 million, or 5.4 , to 41.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 43.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. In the North America segment, revenue decreased by 16.9 million, or 52.1 , compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. In the International segment, revenue increased by 14.5 million, or 128.5 , compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in revenue was driven by a decrease in processing volume in the North America segment, which decreased from 1.0 billion in the nine months ended September 30, 2023, to 562 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023, and is attributable to the previously disclosed impact associated with the Company s QuickCard product transition that began in February 2024. The decrease in revenue in North America was partially offset by an increase in revenue in the International segment that was driven by continued growth in processing volume, which increased from 1.1 billion in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 2.6 billion in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The increase in processing volume in the International segment was driven by continued strong growth across multiple verticals, primarily, our ISO and partnership network, our global payments processing businesses, and banking-as-a-service offering. 

Cost of Revenue 

Cost of revenue decreased by 1.1 million, or 4.1 , to 26.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 25.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. In the North America segment, cost of revenue decreased by 9.7 million, or 51.5 , compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. In the International segment, cost of revenue increased by 8.6 million, or 125.6 , compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Cost of revenue primarily consists of various processing fees paid to gateways, as well as commission payments to the ISOs responsible for establishing and maintaining merchant relationships. The decrease in cost of revenue was primarily driven by a decrease in processing volumes in North America, as noted above, which were partially offset by an increase in processing volumes in the International segment. 

Operating Expenses 

Operating expenses increased by 4.5 million, or 16.5 , to 31.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 27.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to a 6.7 million non-cash charge related to the write-off of goodwill in North America and restructuring charges of 1.6 million related to the Company s reorganization and restructuring of its business in North America, both recorded during the second quarter of 2024. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in professional fees of 2.3 million due to lower accounting, consulting, and legal fees incurred in 2023 in connection with the Company s restatement of prior period consolidated financial statements, and a decrease in research and development expenses of 1.4 million, as the Company began capitalizing a portion of these costs in the second quarter of 2024. 

Other Income (Expense) 

Other expense decreased by 10.0 million, or 74.2 , to 3.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 13.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily driven by a net decrease of 2.5 million related to debt discount accretion expense (- 7.6 million), changes in fair value of derivative liability (+ 6.6 million), and derecognition expense on conversion of convertible debt (- 1.5 million), all primarily recognized in connection with the Company s restructuring of its convertible note during the second quarter of 2024. Additionally, interest expense decreased 2.8 million, legal settlement expense decreased 2.6 million and other income (expense) decreased 2.1 million. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

The Company s consolidated working capital at September 30, 2024 was negative 4.2 million, which included cash and cash equivalents of 4.3 million and restricted cash of 87.2 million. Historically, the Company has financed its operations with proceeds from cash from operations, the sales of equity securities, and its 100 million convertible note. Our material liquidity needs principally relate to working capital requirements and research and development expenditures. 

Due to the product transition described under the Recent Developments section above, we believe that our cash and cash equivalents as of September 30, 2024 are not sufficient to fund the North America segment s operations and capital needs for the next 12 months from the issuance of this Report. Our ability to fund working capital and other expenditures in the North America segment will depend on our ability to generate cash from operating activities from our two operating segments, which is subject to our future operating success, further repatriation of offshore profits from our European subsidiaries, and short-term borrowings in the U.S. 

Our ability to successfully address the short-term liquidity shortfall in the North America segment is contingent on management s intended plan over the next twelve months to improve the segment s liquidity and working capital requirements. Management has determined that its intended plan, if successfully implemented, is appropriate and sufficient to address the liquidity shortfall in the North America segment and provide sufficient funds to cover operations for the next 12 months from the date of issuance of this Report. However, there can be no guarantee that we will be successful in implementing our plan or in acquiring additional funding, that our projections of our future capital needs will prove accurate, or that any additional funding will be sufficient to continue our operations in the North America segment.

Operating Activities For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, net cash provided by operating activities was 19.1 million and 27.6 million, respectively. The cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to the timing of settlement of assets and liabilities. 

Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, was 1.2 million and 0.1 million, respectively. The net cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily relates to capitalized software development costs. 

Financing Activities Net cash used by financing activities in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 was 0.2 million. Net cash used in financing activities in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023 was negligible. 

Critical Accounting Estimates 

We prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. GAAP ). GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. We base our estimates on historical experience, anticipated future trends, and other assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Because these estimates require significant judgment, our actual results may differ materially from our estimates. 

Cash Due from Gateways 

The Company generates the majority of its revenue from payment processing services provided to its merchant clients. When a merchant makes a sale, the process of receiving the payment card information, engaging the banks for transferring the proceeds to the merchant s account via digital gateways, and recording the transaction on a blockchain ledger, are the activities for which the Company gets to collect fees. 

The gateways have strict guidelines pertaining to the scheduling of the release of funds to merchants based on several criteria that include, but are not limited to, return and chargeback history, associated risk for the specific business vertical, average transaction amount, etc. To mitigate potential credit losses associated with these risks, these gateway policies determine reserve requirements and a payment in arrears strategy. While reserve and payment in arrears restrictions are in effect for a merchant payout, the Company records the reserved amounts against cash due from the gateways until released.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 

We are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information otherwise required under this Item. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Regulations under the Exchange Act require public companies to maintain disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and timely communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer (our principal executive officer) and Chief Financial Officer (our principal financial officer), to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Report. Based on their evaluation as of September 30, 2024, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at a reasonable assurance level as of such date. 

Remediation of Material Weakness 

During the first nine months of 2024, with the oversight of the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, the Company executed its remediation plan to address the material weakness identified in Item 9A of its 2023 Annual Report related to not having a complete process in place to fully reconcile the transactions between its operating system (a Company-developed platform) and its general ledger system, at the individual transaction level. The Company took the following actions during the execution of its remediation plan: 

Implemented an enhanced reconciliation preparation and review process 

Implemented changes to its operating system to improve reporting 

Management has determined, through its current year testing, that these controls have been designed and implemented effectively and that these controls operated effectively for a sufficient period of time to conclude that the previously disclosed material weakness related to the reconciliation of transactions between the Company s operating system and its general ledger system as of December 31, 2023, has been remediated as of the date of the filing of this Report. 

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

Except as discussed above, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, which has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 

From time-to-time, the Company is involved in legal proceedings. The following is a summary of our current outstanding litigation. Note that references to GreenBox POS are for historical purposes. GreenBox POS changed its name to RYVYL Inc. on October 13, 2022. 

On November 8, 2022, the Company filed a complaint against its former Chief Operating Officer Vanessa Luna, Luna Consultant Group, LLC and Does 1 through 50 in San Diego Superior Court (the Company Filing ). The Company is alleging that Ms. Luna abused her position for additional compensation, failed to follow proper protocols and breached her fiduciary duties and duty of loyalty by secretly maintaining alternative employment. The action seeks damages, including interest and costs of suit incurred. On November 10, 2022, Ms. Luna filed her own complaint against the Company and Fredi Nisan in San Diego Superior Court (the Luna Filing ). Ms. Luna alleges that Mr. Nisan used contract negotiations to coerce her, that the Company improperly coded transactions and misled investors, and that when her concerns were reported to management, she was wrongfully terminated, resulting in a number of claims. Ms. Luna also alleges sexual misconduct on the part of Mr. Nisan. Ms. Luna is seeking damages including compensatory damages, unpaid wages (past and future), loss of wages and benefits (past and future), and other damages to be proven at trial. The Company and Mr. Nisan deny all allegations of the Luna Filing. In April 2023, Ms. Luna sought to add Coyni, Inc. as a defendant with regard to her claims. She was granted permission to file a Second Amended Complaint, and Coyni, Inc. has challenged the allegations by way of demurrer, which was denied on August 9, 2024. In addition, the Company and Mr. Nisan have filed a motion for leave to amend their complaint against Luna, adding additional claims against her, including securities fraud, and, on August 9, 2024, the Court granted permission for the Company to file a Second Amended Complaint. As the Company cannot predict the outcome of the matter, the probability of an outcome cannot be determined. The Company intends to vigorously defend against all claims asserted by Ms. Luna and to vigorously prosecute its own claims against Ms. Luna. The San Diego Superior Court consolidated the Company Filing and Luna Filing into a single proceeding, RYVYL Inc. v. Luna, on August 4, 2023. The parties are currently in the discovery phase. On October 17, 2024, the parties entered into a confidential settlement agreement, and on October 24, 2024, a stipulated motion to stay all pleadings was filed with the Court. 

On December 12, 2022, Jacqueline Dollar (aka Jacqueline Reynolds), former Chief Marketing Officer of the Company, filed a complaint against the Company, Fredi Nisan, and Does 1-20 in San Diego Superior Court. Ms. Dollar is alleging she was undercompensated compared to her male counterparts and retaliated against after raising concerns to management resulting in sex discrimination in violation of the California Fair Employment and Housing Act FEHA and failure to prevent discrimination in violation of FEHA. Ms. Dollar is also claiming intentional infliction of emotional distress. Ms. Dollar is seeking an unspecified amount of damages related to, among other things, payment of past and future lost wages, stock issuances, bonuses and benefits, compensatory damages, and general, economic, non-economic, and special damages. As the Company cannot predict the outcome of the matter, the probability of an outcome cannot be determined. The Company intends to vigorously defend against all claims. The parties are currently in the discovery phase. 

On February 1, 2023, a putative class action lawsuit titled Cullen v. RYVYL Inc. fka GreenBox POS, Inc., et al., Case No. 3:23-cv-00185-GPC-AGS, was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of California against several defendants, including the Company and certain of our current and former directors and officers (the Cullen Defendants ). The complaint was filed on behalf of persons who purchased or otherwise acquired the Company s publicly traded securities between January 29, 2021 and January 20, 2023. The complaint alleged that the Cullen Defendants violated Sections 11, 12(a)(2), and 15 of the Securities Act and Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act by making false and/or misleading statements regarding the Company s financial controls, performance and prospects. On June 30, 2023, the plaintiff filed an amended complaint. All defendants filed motions to dismiss the amended complaint on August 14, 2023. On March 1, 2024, the Court issued an order granting in part and denying in part defendants motions to dismiss, which included dismissing all Securities Act claims and narrowing the potential class period. The plaintiff filed a second amended complaint on April 30, 2024, which alleges claims against the Cullen Defendants under Exchange Act Sections 10(b) and 20(a) only and a class period of May 13, 2021 through January 20, 2023. The Company filed its motion to dismiss the second amended complaint on July 1, 2024. On October 21, 2024, the Court issued an order granting in part and denying in part defendants motions to dismiss. The scope of the remaining claims is consistent with the Court s last motion to dismiss decision dated March 1, 2024. On November 12, 2024, Plaintiff filed a Third Amended Complaint, which asserts the same legal causes of action and proposed class period as the previous complaint. The Company is evaluating the amended complaint and may be filing a further motion to dismiss. 

The action seeks damages, including interest, and the award of reasonable fees and costs to the putative class. The Company denies all allegations of liability and intends to vigorously defend against all claims. However, given the preliminary stage of the lawsuit, the uncertainty of litigation, and the legal standards that must be met for success on the merits, the Company cannot predict the outcome at this time or estimate a reasonably possible loss or range of loss that may result from this action.

On June 22, 2023, a shareholder derivative complaint was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of California against certain of the Company s current and/or former officers and directors (the Hertel Defendants ), Christy Hertel, derivatively on behalf of RYVYL Inc., f/k/a GreenBox POS v. Ben Errez et al., Case No. 3:23-CV-01165-GPC-SBC. On August 4, 2023, a second shareholder derivative complaint was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of California against the Hertel Defendants, Marcus Gazaway, derivatively on behalf of RYVYL Inc., f/k/a GreenBox POS v. Ben Errez et al., Case No. 3:23-CV-01425-LAB-BLM. Both derivative complaints generally allege that the Hertel Defendants failed to implement adequate internal controls that would prevent false and misleading financial information from being published by the Company and that controlling shareholders participated in overpayment misconduct resulting in violations of Sections 10(b), 14(a) and 20 of the Exchange Act and breached their fiduciary duties and, purportedly on behalf of the Company. On April 2, 2024, the Court granted the parties joint motion for an order consolidating the Hertel and Gazaway cases under the caption In re RYVYL Inc. Derivative Litigation, Lead Case No. 3:23-CV-01165-GPC-SBC (S.D. Cal.). On May 6, 2024, the Court issued an order staying the action until after the final resolution of any motion to dismiss the securities class action detailed above. On May 1, 2024, a third nearly identical shareholder derivative complaint was filed in Clark County, Nevada by plaintiff Christina Brown, derivatively on behalf of RYVYL, Inc., v. Ben Errez et al., Case No. A-24-892382-C. The Company currently is working with Ms. Brown s counsel to coordinate a stay of the Nevada action on the same terms as the stay of the Hertel and Gazaway cases. 

The complaint seeks damages and contribution from the Hertel Defendants and a direction that the Company and the Hertel Defendants take actions to reform and improve corporate governance and internal procedures to comply with applicable laws. The Hertel Defendants deny all allegations of liability and intend to vigorously defend against all claims. However, given the preliminary stage of the lawsuits, the uncertainty of litigation, and the legal standards that must be met for success on the merits, the Company cannot predict the outcome of either case at this time. 

On October 1, 2023, the Company filed a demand for arbitration against Sky Financial with the American Arbitration Association in San Diego, California (the Arbitration ). In the Arbitration, the Company seeks to recover for breach of contract and Sky Financial s failure to perform its obligations On October 2, 2023, the Company filed a complaint against Sky Financial in San Diego Superior Court asserting the same claims asserted in the Arbitration, solely to toll any applicable statutes of limitations pending the Arbitration and, if necessary, provide jurisdiction for the court to compel arbitration. The action seeks damages, including interest and costs of suit incurred. The parties agreed to proceed in the Arbitration and to implement the steps needed to extend the current stay of the San Diego Superior Court action pending the Arbitration. Subsequently, the parties agreed to stay the Arbitration and attend mediation. A mediation was scheduled but then vacated by stipulation of the parties. The parties have agreed to continue the stay of the Arbitration pending a mediation, which is to be re-scheduled. 

On July 6, 2022, the Company s subsidiary, RYVYL EU (formerly known as Transact Europe OOD), received a notary invitation from Satya Consulting PTE Limited Satya filed in Bulgaria. In the filed claim, Satya alleges nonpayment of its fee in the amount of EUR 900,000, to which statutory default interest is to be added, for failure of payment under the Company s stock purchase agreement for Transact Europe Holdings OOD. RYVYL EU has retained Bulgarian counsel to assist in the defense of the asserted claim and denies all allegations. As RYVYL EU cannot predict the outcome of the matter, the probability of an outcome cannot be determined. RYVYL EU intends to vigorously defend against all claims. On October 18, 2024, RYVYL EU entered into a confidential settlement agreement with no material impact to the Company. A hearing is scheduled for November 15, 2024, where it is expected that the Court will approve the settlement and terminate the case. 

On January 2, 2024, the Company filed a Statement of Claim against Chessa Sabourin in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice. Case No. CV-24-00712190-0000. The Company seeks to recover funds unlawfully held by Sabourin, or in the alternative, damages in the equivalent amount. Additionally, punitive and exemplary damages. In September 2023, the Company mistakenly sent funds to Ms. Sabourin and attempted to reverse or recall the transfers but was unable to do so. To date, Ms. Sabourin has failed and/or refused to return the funds mistakenly sent to her. On October 21, 2024, the Court issued a default judgment against Sabourin. 

On June 25, 2024, J. Drew Byelick, a former Chief Financial Officer of the Company, filed a complaint against the Company in the United States District Court for the Southern District of California, Case No. 24CV1096 JLS MSB. Mr. Byelick is alleging breach of contract, fraudulent inducement of employment, along with intentional misrepresentation and concealment. The Company filed a motion to dismiss the complaint on October 4, 2024 and Mr. Byelick filed an opposition to the Company s motion on November 8, 2024. The Company denies all allegations of liability and intends to vigorously defend against all claims. However, given the preliminary stage of the lawsuit, the uncertainty of litigation, and the legal standards that must be met for success on the merits, the Company cannot predict the outcome at this time or estimate a reasonably possible loss or range of loss that may result from this action.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 

Other than the newly identified risk factor described below, there have been no material changes with respect to risk factors previously disclosed in the Company s 2023 Annual Report. 

Our revenue projections related to our new licensing arrangements with payment services providers may not materialize due to customer acquisition and banking compliance issues that are outside of our control. 

As part of the Company s plan to diversify its business, it recently launched a new licensing product for its payment processing platform. The Company will generate revenues from these arrangements from use-based license fees that it will charge to the payment services providers. The Company s ability to generate revenues from these licensing arrangements is contingent on the success of the licensees in utilizing and servicing their customers on their platforms, as the licensees will have exclusive control over, among other things, implementation and operations of the point of banking system, procurement of ACH processing solutions, and customer acquisitions. 

The licensees will also have control in determining clients and industries utilizing the licensed technology, which requires an understanding of various banking laws and regulations that may impact the licensee s servicing of customer accounts. For example, federal money laundering statutes and Bank Secrecy Act regulations discourage financial institutions from working with operators of certain industries, particularly those with heightened cash reporting obligations and restrictions. As a result, banks may refuse to process certain payments and/or require onerous reporting obligations by payment processors to avoid compliance risk. These and other complexities surrounding banking and payment processing laws may make it difficult for the licensees to acquire customers, thereby negatively impacting the Company s ability to generate revenues from these arrangements. 

ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS 

None. 

ITEM 3. DEFAULTS UPON SENIOR SECURITIES
