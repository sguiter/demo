FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS 

The Securities and Exchange Commission SEC encourages companies to disclose forward-looking information so that investors can better understand future prospects and make informed
investment decisions. This report contains these types of statements. Words such as may, intend, expect, 
 believe, anticipate, estimate, project, or continue or comparable
terminology used in connection with any discussion of future operating results or financial performance identify forward-looking statements.
You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on the forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this report. All forward-looking
statements reflect our present expectation of future events and are subject to a number of important factors and uncertainties that could
cause actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements. 

 In this report references to Cancer Capital, the Company, 
 we, us, and our refer to Cancer Capital Corp. 

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Executive Overview 

We have not recorded revenues from operations since
inception, and we are dependent upon financing to continue basic operations. Management intends to rely upon advances or loans from management,
significant stockholders or third parties to meet our cash requirements, but we have not entered into written agreements guaranteeing
funds and, therefore, no one is obligated to provide funds to us in the future. These factors raise substantial doubt as to our ability
to continue as a going concern. Our plan is to combine with an operating company to generate revenue. 

As of the date of this report, our management has
not had any discussions with any representative of any other entity regarding a business combination with us. Any target business that
is selected may be a financially unstable company or an entity in its early stages of development or growth, including entities without
established records of sales or earnings. In that event, we will be subject to numerous risks inherent in the business and operations
of financially unstable and early stage or potential emerging growth companies. In addition, we may complete a business combination with
an entity in an industry characterized by a high level of risk, and, although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent
in a particular target business, there can be no assurance that we will properly ascertain or assess all significant risks. In addition,
any business combination or transaction will likely result in a significant issuance of shares and substantial dilution to present stockholders
of the Company. 

We anticipate that the
selection of a business opportunity will be complex and extremely risky. Because of general economic conditions, rapid technological advances
being made in some industries and shortages of available capital, our management believes that there are numerous firms seeking the perceived
benefits of becoming a publicly traded corporation. Such perceived benefits of becoming a publicly traded corporation include, among other
things, facilitating or improving the terms on which additional equity financing may be obtained, providing liquidity for the principals
of and investors in a business, creating a means for providing incentive stock options or similar benefits to key employees, and offering
greater flexibility in structuring acquisitions, joint ventures and the like through the issuance of securities. Potentially available
business combinations may occur in many different industries and at various stages of development, all of which will make the task of
comparative investigation and analysis of such business opportunities extremely difficult and complex. 

If we obtain a business opportunity, then it may be
necessary to raise additional capital. We anticipate that we will sell our Common Stock to raise this additional capital. We expect that
we would issue such stock pursuant to exemptions to the registration requirements provided by federal and state securities laws. The purchasers
and manner of issuance will be determined according to our financial needs and the available exemptions to the registration requirements
of the Securities Act of 1933. We do not currently intend to make a public offering of our stock. We also note that if we issue more shares
of our Common Stock, then our stockholders may experience dilution in the value per share of their Common Stock. 

9 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

We have not recorded
revenues from operations since inception and we have not established an ongoing source of revenue sufficient to cover our operating costs.
We have relied primarily upon related parties and third parties to provide, and pay for, professional and operational expenses. At September
30, 2024, we had 4,109 cash and at December 31, 2023,
we had 16,157. At September 30, 2024, total liabilities
increased to 487,713 compared to 465,549 at December 31, 2023. Total liabilities primarily represent an increase in accounts payable
and accrued interest for all notes payable and notes payable-related party for cash advances, consulting services and professional services
provided by or paid for by a stockholder (See Commitments and Obligations, below). 

We intend to obtain capital from management, significant
stockholders and/or third parties to cover minimal operations; however, there is no assurance that additional funding will be available.
Our ability to continue as a going concern during the long term is dependent upon our ability to find a suitable business opportunity
and acquire, or enter into a merger with, such company. The type of business opportunity with which we acquire or merge, will affect our
profitability for the long term. 

During the next 12 months we anticipate incurring additional costs related
to the filing of Exchange Act reports. We believe we will be able to meet these costs through funds provided by management, significant
stockholders and/or third parties. We may also rely on the issuance of our Common Stock in lieu of cash to convert debt or pay for expenses. 

Results of Operations 

We did not record revenues
in either the nine months ended September 30, 2024 or 2023. General and administrative expense for the nine months ended September 30,
2024 was 16,546 compared to 11,498 the nine months ended
September 30, 2023. General and administrative expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 2,548 compared to 2,900 for
the three months ended September 30, 2023 

Total other expense increased to 17,665 for the September
30, 2024 Nine-Month Period compared to 17,125 for the September 30, 2023 Nine-Month Period. Total other expense increased to 5,888 for
the September 30, 2024 Third Quarter compared to 5,708 for the September 30, 2023 Third Quarter. Total other expense represents interest
expense related to notes payable and notes payable - related party. 

Our net loss increased
to 34,211 for the September 30, 2024 Nine-Month Period compared to 28,623 for the September 30, 2023 Nine-Month Period. Our net loss
decreased 8,436 for the September 30, 2024 Third Quarter compared to 8,608 for the September 30, 2023 Third Quarter. Management expects
net losses to continue until we acquire or merge with a business opportunity. 

Commitments and Obligations 

At September 30, 2024, we reported notes payable totaling
 130,275 with accrued interest of 82,812.50. We recorded notes payable - related party totaling 164,125 with accrued interest of 100,000.50.
All of the notes payable are non-collateralized, carry interest at 8 and are due on demand. 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a
shareholder invoiced the Company for consulting, administrative and professional services and out-of-pocket costs provided or paid on
behalf of the Company totaling 4,500 resulting in the Company owing the shareholder 10,500 at September 30, 2024. 

As of September 30, 2024 two lenders represent in
excess of 95 of our accounts and notes payable. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

We have not entered into any off-balance sheet arrangements
that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues
or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources and would be considered material to investors. 

Emerging Growth Company 

We qualify as an emerging growth company as that term
is used in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the JOBS Act ). A company qualifies as an emerging growth company
if it has total annual gross revenues of less than 1.07 billion during its most recently completed fiscal year and, as of December 8,
2011, had not sold common equity securities under a registration statement. Under the JOBS Act we are permitted to, and intend to, rely
on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements. 

In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides
that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities
Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain
accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to take advantage of the benefits
of this extended transition period. Our financial statements may therefore not be comparable to those of companies that comply with such
new or revised accounting standards.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES
ABOUT MARKET RISK 

Not applicable to smaller reporting companies. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as
defined in Rule 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in
our filings under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the periods specified in the rules and forms
of the SEC. This information is accumulated to allow our management to make timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our President,
who serves as our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls
and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report and he determined that our disclosure controls and procedures were not
effective due to a control deficiency. During the period we did not have additional personnel to allow segregation of duties to ensure
the completeness or accuracy of our information. Due to the size and operations of the Company we are unable to remediate this deficiency
until we acquire or merge with another company. 

Changes to Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

Our management is responsible
for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act).
Management conducted an evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting and determined that there were no changes made in
our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 ,
that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting. 

11
