million total purchase consideration. As part of the D2C Media Acquisition, the Company may be required to pay a cash earnout of up to an additional CAD million (approximately USD million as of September 30, 2024). The payment is not included in the total purchase consideration and is deemed compensation expense, as the potential cash compensation is to former equity holders who became employees and will be forfeited if employment is terminated prior to the end of the earnout period. The amount to be paid will be determined by the acquired business future achievement of certain revenue-related financial targets through December 31, 2025 and expensed over each performance period. The Company may expense up to CAD million (approximately USD million as of September 30, 2024) associated with the remaining portion of the earnout for each of the years ending December 31, 2024 and 2025. Purchase Price Allocation. The fair values assigned to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed were determined based on management s estimates and assumptions, as well as other information compiled by management, including third-party valuations that utilize customary valuation procedures and techniques, such as the multi-period excess earnings and the relief of royalty methods.

The Company reviews and reassesses the estimated fair value of contingent consideration liabilities at each reporting period and the updated fair value could differ materially from the initial estimates. The Company recorded a contingent consideration liability at its estimated fair value at the date of acquisition based on expected future payment. The Company measures contingent consideration recognized in connection with acquisitions at fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs classified as Level 3 inputs. The fair value measurement has one significant input of projected financial information. Significant increases or decreases to this input in isolation could result in a significantly higher or lower liability. Ultimately, the liability will be equivalent to the amount paid, and the difference between the fair value estimate on the acquisition date and each reporting period and the amount paid will be

Note About Forward-Looking Statements 
 
 This report contains "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the federal securities laws. All statements other than statements of historical facts are forward-looking statements. These statements often use words such as "believe," "expect," "project," "anticipate," "outlook," "intend," "strategy," "plan," "estimate," "target," "seek," "will," "may,' "would," "should," "could," "forecasts," "mission," "strive," "more," "goal" or similar expressions. Forward-looking statements are based on our current expectations, beliefs, strategies, estimates, projections and assumptions, experience in the industry as well as our perceptions of historical trends, current conditions, expected future developments, condition of the global supply chain, fluctuating fuel prices, interest rate environment, inflationary pressures and other factors we think are appropriate. Such forward-looking statements, while considered reasonable by the Company and its management, are inherently uncertain. While the Company and its management make such statements in good faith and believe such judgments are reasonable, you should understand that these statements are not guarantees of future strategic action, performance or results. Our actual results, performance, achievements, strategic actions or prospects could differ materially from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. Given these uncertainties, you should not rely on forward-looking statements in making investment decisions. When we make comparisons of results between current and prior periods, we do not intend to express any future trends, or indications of future performance, unless expressed as such, and you should only view such comparisons as historical data. Forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks, uncertainties and other important factors, many of which are beyond our control, that could cause our actual results and strategic actions to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements contained in this report. Factors that might cause such differences include, but are not limited to: 
 
 Our business is subject to risks related to the larger automotive ecosystem, including consumer demand, direct-to-consumer sales models and other macroeconomic issues. 

Market acceptance of and influence over certain of our products and services is concentrated with a limited number of automobile OEMs and dealership associations and we may not be able to maintain or grow these relationships. 

Dealer closures or consolidation among dealers or OEMs could reduce demand for, and negatively affect the pricing of, our marketing and solutions offerings, thereby leading to decreased earnings. 

Our business depends on our strong brand recognition, and any failure to maintain, protect and enhance our brands could hurt our ability to retain or expand our base of consumers, dealers and customers, and our ability to increase the frequency with which consumers, dealers and customers use our services. 

Our increased operations in Canada involve risks that may differ from, or are in addition to, our domestic operational risks. 

We rely in part on Internet search engines and mobile application stores to drive traffic to the Cars.com properties and increase downloads of our mobile applications. If the Cars.com properties and mobile applications fail to appear prominently in these search results, traffic to the Cars.com properties and mobile applications would decline and our business, results of operations or financial condition may be materially and adversely affected. 

We rely on in-house content creation and development to drive organic traffic to the Cars.com properties and mobile applications. 

Certain of our third-party service providers are highly regulated financial institutions, and the federal and state laws related to financial services could have a direct or indirect materially adverse effect on our business. 

Our business may be affected by climate change, including physical risks and regulatory changes that may increase our operating costs and impact our ability to deliver services to our customers. 

Expectations relating to environmental, social and governance considerations expose Cars Commerce to potential liabilities, increased costs, reputational harm and other adverse effects on the Company s business. 

We participate in a highly competitive market, and pressure from existing and new competitors may materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. 

We compete with other consumer automotive websites and mobile applications and other digital content providers for share of automotive-related digital display advertising spending and may be unable to maintain or grow our base of advertising customers or increase our revenue from existing customers. 

If we do not adapt to automated buying strategies, our display advertising revenue could be adversely affected. 

We may face difficulties in developing and launching new solution offerings or growing our complementary offerings that help automotive brands and dealers create enduring customer relationships. 

Strategic acquisitions, investments and partnerships could pose various risks, including integration risks, increase our leverage, dilute existing stockholders and significantly impact our ability to expand our overall profitability. 

14 

The value of our assets or operations may be diminished if our information technology systems fail to perform adequately. 

Our business is dependent on keeping pace with advances in technology. If we are unable to keep pace with advances in technology, consumers and customers may stop using our services and our revenue may decrease. 

We rely on third-party service providers for many aspects of our business, including inventory information and sales of our product through social media, and interruptions in the services or data they provide or any failure to maintain these relationships could harm our business. 

We rely on technology systems availability and ability to prevent unauthorized access. If our security and resiliency measures fail to prevent incidents, it could result in damage to our reputation, incur costs and create liabilities. 

We rely on third-party services to track and calculate certain of our key metrics, including unique visitors and traffic and any errors or interruptions in the services or data they provide or any failure to maintain these relationships could harm our business. 

If the use of third-party cookies or other tracking technologies is rejected by Internet browsers or service providers or users, restricted, blocked, or subject to unfavorable laws or regulations, the amount of Internet user information would decrease, which may harm our business and operating results. 

Our ability to attract and retain customers depends on our ability to collect and use data and develop tools to enable us to effectively deliver and accurately measure advertisements on our platform. 

Uncertainty exists in the application and interpretation of various laws and regulations related to our business, including privacy laws. New privacy concerns or laws or regulations applicable to our business, or the expansion or interpretation of existing laws and regulations that apply to our business, could reduce the effectiveness of our offerings or subject us to use restrictions, licensing requirements, claims, judgments and remedies including sales and use taxes, other monetary liabilities and limitations on our business practices, and could increase administrative costs. 

Misappropriation or infringement of our intellectual property and proprietary rights, enforcement actions to protect our intellectual property and claims from third parties relating to intellectual property could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. 

We have a limited history of operating with a virtual first workforce and the long-term impact on our financial results and business operations is uncertain. 

Our ability to operate effectively could be impaired if we fail to attract and retain our key employees. 

Adverse results from litigation or governmental investigations could impact our business practices and operating results. 

The value of our existing goodwill and intangible assets may become impaired depending upon future operating results. 

We cannot assure our stockholders that our share repurchase program will enhance long-term stockholder value and stock repurchases, if any, could increase the volatility of the price of our common stock and will diminish our cash reserves. 

We do not expect to pay any cash dividends for the foreseeable future. 

Your percentage of ownership in the Company may be diluted in the future. 

Certain provisions of our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, By-laws and Delaware law may discourage takeovers and limit our ability to use, acquire, or develop certain competing businesses. 

Our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation designates the state courts of the State of Delaware, or, if no state court located in the State of Delaware has jurisdiction, the federal court for the District of Delaware, as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could discourage lawsuits against us and our directors and officers. 

Our business could be negatively affected as a result of actions of activist stockholders, and such activism could impact the trading value of our common stock. 

Our debt agreements contain restrictions that may limit our flexibility in operating our business. 

Increases in interest rates could increase interest payable under our variable rate indebtedness. 

Our debt levels could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations, limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry, inhibit us from making beneficial acquisitions, adversely impact our ability to implement our capital allocation strategy and prevent us from making debt service payments. In addition, changing or increasing interest rates, including the rates under our debt agreements, could adversely affect our business or financial condition.

Average Monthly Unique Visitors ("UVs") and Traffic. UVs and Traffic are fundamental to our business. They are indicative of our consumer reach and the level of engagement consumers have with our platform. Although our consumer engagement does not directly result in revenue, we believe our ability to reach in-market car shoppers is attractive to our dealers, OEMs and national customers and a primary reason they do business with us. We believe we have achieved audience scale as measured by UVs and Traffic, and we drive increased Traffic through a combination of continued growth in UVs and higher repeat visitation and engagement. Traffic increases can result in increased impressions, clicks and other connections that we can ultimately monetize through our products and services. 
 
 We define UVs in a given month as the number of distinct visitors that engage with our platform during that month. Visitors are identified when a user first visits an individual Cars.com property on an individual device/browser combination or installs one of our mobile apps on an individual device. If a visitor accesses more than one of our web properties or apps or uses more than one device or browser, each of those unique property/browser/app/device combinations counts toward the number of UVs. Traffic is defined as the number of visits 
 17 

to Cars.com desktop and mobile properties (responsive sites and mobile apps). We measured UVs and Traffic via Adobe Analytics through the year ended December 31, 2023. As of January 1, 2024, we now measure UVs and Traffic via RudderStack, which we believe better aligns to our product and technology platform and provides improved visibility into our UVs and Traffic. Prior period UVs and Traffic information has not been recast, as it is impracticable to do so. These metrics do not include traffic to Dealer Inspire or D2C Media websites. 
 
 UVs declined 6 and 3 year-over-year for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, primarily due to normalizing demand from consumers given increased vehicle inventory levels, continued elevated prices and higher interest rates, as well as changes in marketing investment and mix across quarters and search engine algorithm updates earlier in the year. Additionally, UVs for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 benefited from Q1 2023 being our highest quarter ever for UVs. 
 
 During each of the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, Traffic increased 2 compared to September 30, 2023, primarily driven by the shift to RudderStack, higher repeat visitation and optimization of our user acquisition strategy, partially offset by marketing investment and mix across quarters. 
 
 Dealer Customers . Dealer Customers represent dealerships using our products as of the end of each reporting period. Each physical or virtual dealership location is counted separately, whether it is a single-location proprietorship or part of a large, consolidated dealer group. Multi-franchise dealerships at a single location are counted as one dealer. Beginning December 31, 2023, this key operating metric includes D2C Media. 
 
 Dealer Customers increased 3 from September 30, 2023, primarily due to the inclusion of 950 D2C Media customers as of December 31, 2023, partially offset by the anticipated churn from our 2023 marketplace repackaging initiative. 
 
 Dealer Customers decreased slightly by 1 from June 30, 2024, primarily due to a decrease in marketplace Dealer Customers. 
 
 Monthly Average Revenue Per Dealer ("ARPD"). We believe that our ability to grow ARPD is an indicator of the value proposition of our platform. We define ARPD as Dealer revenue, excluding digital advertising services, during the period divided by the monthly average number of Dealer Customers during the same period. Beginning December 31, 2023, this key operating metric includes D2C Media. 
 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, ARPD decreased 3 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to the inclusion of D2C Media customers, who have a lower ARPD. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, ARPD remained flat compared to the three months ended June 30, 2024. 
 
 Factors Affecting Our Performance. Our business is impacted by changes in the larger automotive ecosystem, including supply and demand for new and used vehicle inventory, global supply chain and information systems disruptions, semiconductor and raw material shortages, vehicle acquisition cost, vehicle retail prices, electric vehicle adoption, employee retention and changes related to automotive advertising, among other macroeconomic factors including inflationary pressures and prevailing interest rates. Changes in vehicle sales volumes in the United States and Canada also influence OEMs and dealerships willingness to increase investments in technology solutions and automotive marketplaces like Cars.com and could impact our pricing strategies and/or revenue mix. 
 
 Our long-term success will depend in part on our ability to continue to execute our platform strategy including continuing to create the most engaged in-market audience, growing our dealer customers, expanding our relationship with dealers through greater adoption of our platform, unlocking the cross-sell, transforming our OEM relationships and creating platform advantages. We believe our core strategic strengths, including our powerful family of brands, growing high-quality audience and suite of digital solutions for advertisers, including machine learning model artificial intelligence, will assist us as we navigate a rapidly changing automotive environment. Additionally, we are focused on equipping our customers with digital solutions to enable them to compete in an environment in which an increasing number of car-buying customers are shopping online. These solutions include online chat, vehicle financing, appraisal and valuation, instant guaranteed offer capabilities and logistics technology. The foundation of our continued success is the value we deliver to customers, and we believe that our large audience of in-market car shoppers and innovative solutions deliver significant value to our customers.

 Dealer revenue. Dealer revenue is typically subscription-oriented and consists of marketplace, digital experience, including website solutions and AccuTrade, and media products sold to dealer customers. Dealer revenue is our largest revenue stream, representing 89 and 90 of total revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Dealer revenue increased 2.4 million or 2 , primarily driven by the incremental revenue related to the addition of the D2C Media business and growth in digital experience revenue, partially offset by a decrease in marketplace revenue, which we believe is driven by macroeconomic trends impacting dealer customer profitability. 
 
 OEM and National revenue. OEM and National revenue largely consists of Cars Commerce Media Network products, including display advertising and other solutions sold to OEMs, advertising agencies, automotive dealer associations and auto adjacent businesses, including insurance companies. OEM and National revenue represented 9 and 8 of total revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. OEM and National revenue increased 2.5 million or 17 , driven by OEM spending to raise consumer awareness, as on-the lot inventory continues to increase. 
 
 Other revenue. Other revenue primarily consists of revenue related to vehicle listing data sold to third parties and pay per lead products. Other revenue represented 2 of total revenue for each of the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Other revenue increased 0.5 million or 17 , primarily driven by the incremental revenue related to the addition of the D2C Media business. 
 
 Cost of revenue and operations . Cost of revenue and operations expense primarily consists of costs related to processing dealer vehicle inventory, product fulfillment, pay per lead products and compensation costs for the product fulfillment and customer service teams. Cost of revenue and operations expense represented 18 of total revenue for each of the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Cost of revenue and operations increased 0.5 million or 2 , primarily due to incremental costs related to the addition of the D2C Media business and higher third-party costs to support increases in revenue. 
 
 Product and technology. The product team creates and manages consumer and customer-facing innovation and consumer and customer experience. The technology team develops and supports our products, websites and mobile apps. Product and technology expense includes compensation costs, consulting and contractor costs, hardware and software maintenance, software licenses and other infrastructure costs. Product and technology expense represented 16 and 15 of total revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Product and technology expense increased 3.9 million or 16 , primarily due to higher compensation, including stock-based compensation and third-party costs, including licenses. 
 
 19 

Marketing and sales . Marketing and sales expense primarily consists of traffic and lead acquisition costs, performance and brand marketing, trade events, compensation costs and travel for the marketing, sales and sales support teams, as well as bad debt expense related to the allowance for doubtful accounts. Marketing and sales expense represented 32 and 35 of total revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Marketing and sales expense decreased 1.9 million or 3 , primarily due to changes in our marketing investment and mix. 
 
 General and administrative . General and administrative expense primarily consists of compensation costs for certain of the executive, finance, legal, human resources, facilities and other administrative employees. In addition, general and administrative expense includes the cost of office space, legal, accounting and other professional services, transaction-related costs, severance, transformation and other exit costs and costs related to the write-off of assets. General and administrative expense represented 12 and 10 of total revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. General and administrative expense increased 3.7 million or 21 , the majority of which is due to incremental costs related to the addition of the D2C Media business, including the compensation expense related to the D2C Media earnout. Additionally, the change is also impacted by higher compensation, including stock-based compensation. For information related to the D2C Media earnout, see Note 3 (Business Combinations) to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1., "Financial Statements" of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 
 Depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense increased 1.9 million or 7 , primarily due to depreciation and amortization on additional assets acquired and the amortization of intangible assets related to the D2C Media Acquisition, partially offset by certain assets being fully depreciated and amortized as compared to the prior-year period. 
 
 Interest expense, net . Interest expense, net was essentially flat compared to the prior year period. For information related to our debt, see Note 5 (Debt) to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1., "Financial Statements" of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 
 Other income (expense), net. Other income (expense), net changed primarily due to the change in the fair value of contingent consideration associated with the AccuTrade and CreditIQ acquisitions. For more information related to contingent consideration, see the Liquidity and Capital Resources section below and Note 4 (Fair Value Measurements) to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1., "Financial Statements" of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 
 Income tax expense (benefit) . The effective income tax rate differed from the statutory federal income tax rate of 21 , primarily due to the impact of state income taxes, net of federal income tax expense, partially offset by tax credits.

 Dealer revenue. Dealer revenue is our largest revenue stream, representing 89 and 90 of total revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Dealer revenue increased 20.9 million or 5 , primarily driven by the incremental revenue related to the addition of the D2C Media business and growth in digital experience revenue, including our website creation and hosting. 
 
 OEM and National revenue. OEM and National revenue represented 9 and 8 of total revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. OEM and National revenue increased 7.7 million or 19 , primarily due to increased OEM spending to raise consumer awareness, as on-the lot inventory continues to increase. 
 
 Other revenue. Other revenue represented 2 of total revenue for each of the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Other revenue increased 0.6 million or 7 , primarily due to the incremental revenue related to the addition of the D2C Media business, partially offset by the first quarter 2023 expiration of a license agreement entered into as part of the AccuTrade acquisition. 
 
 Cost of revenue and operations . Cost of revenue and operations expense represented 17 and 18 of total revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Cost of revenue and operations increased 1.3 million or 1 , but decreased as a percentage of revenue. The change is primarily due to the incremental costs related to the addition of the D2C Media business. 
 
 Product and technology. Product and technology expense represented 16 and 15 of total revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Product and technology expense increased 10.5 million or 14 , primarily due to higher compensation, including stock-based compensation and third-party costs, including licenses. 
 
 Marketing and sales . Marketing and sales expense represented 33 and 35 of total revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Marketing and sales expense increased 1.0 million or 1 , primarily due to incremental costs related to the addition of the D2C Media business, partially offset by changes in our marketing investment and mix. 
 
 General and administrative . General and administrative expense represented 13 and 11 of total revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. General and administrative expense increased 13.6 million or 25 , the majority of which is due to incremental costs related to the addition of the D2C Media business, including the compensation expense related to the D2C Media earnout. Additionally, the change is impacted by higher compensation, including stock-based compensation. For information related to the D2C Media earnout, see Note 3 (Business Combinations) to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1., "Financial Statements" of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

Depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense increased 8.1 million or 11 , primarily due to depreciation and amortization on additional assets acquired and the amortization of intangible assets related to the D2C Media Acquisition, partially offset by certain assets being fully depreciated and amortized as compared to the prior-year period. 
 
 Interest expense, net . Interest expense, net was essentially flat compared to the prior year period. For information related to our debt, see Note 5 (Debt) to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1., "Financial Statements" of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

 Income tax expense (benefit) . The effective income tax rate differed from the statutory federal income tax rate of 21 , primarily due to the impact of state income taxes, net of federal income tax expense, nondeductible executive compensation and nondeductible transaction expenses, partially offset by tax credits and the tax benefits realized on stock-based compensation. The prior period income tax benefit was primarily due to the release of a significant portion of our valuation allowance for deferred tax assets that had been recorded as a result of the 2020 goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairments. For more information, see Note 10 (Income Taxes) to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1., "Financial Statements" of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 Overview. Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations, available cash reserves and borrowing capacity available under our credit facility. Our positive operating cash flow, along with our Revolving Loan, provide adequate liquidity to meet our business needs for the next 12 months and beyond, including those for investments, debt service, share repurchases, contingent consideration payments and strategic acquisitions. However, our ability to maintain adequate liquidity in the future is dependent upon a number of factors, including our revenue, our ability to contain costs, including capital expenditures, and to collect accounts receivable and various other macroeconomic factors, many of which are beyond our direct control. 
 
 We may also seek to raise funds through debt or equity financing in the future to fund operations, significant investments or acquisitions that are consistent with our strategy. If we need to access the capital markets, there can be no assurance that financing may be available on attractive terms, if at all. As of September 30, 2024, Cash and cash equivalents were 49.6 million and including our undrawn Revolving Loan, our total liquidity was 329.6 million. 
 
 Indebtedness. As of September 30, 2024, the outstanding aggregate principal amount of our indebtedness was 470.0 million, at an average interest rate of 6.4 , including 400.0 million of outstanding aggregate principal under the 6.375 Senior Unsecured Notes due in 2028 and 70.0 million of outstanding principal under the Revolving Loan which had an interest rate of 6.8 . 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we made 10.0 million in mandatory Term Loan payments and repaid 10.0 million on our Revolving Loan. In connection with the Fifth Amendment, we borrowed 80.0 million under the new Revolving Loan to repay the outstanding 45.0 million in aggregate principal amount of existing Term Loan and 35.0 million aggregate principal amount of existing Revolving Loan balances. As of September 30, 2024, 280.0 million was available to borrow under the Revolving Loan. Our borrowings are limited by our Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio and Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio, in addition to other factors. Calculated in accordance with our Credit Agreement, these ratios were 0.1x and 6.4x, respectively, as of September 30, 2024. For further information, see Note 5 (Debt) to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1., "Financial Statements" of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 
 Share Repurchase Program . In February 2022, our Board of Directors authorized a three-year share repurchase program to acquire up to 200.0 million of our common stock. The repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time and does not obligate us to repurchase any specific amount or number of shares. We may repurchase shares from time to time in open market transactions or through privately negotiated transactions in accordance with applicable federal securities laws and other applicable legal requirements, and subject to our blackout periods. We intend to fund the share repurchase program principally with cash from operations. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we repurchased and subsequently retired 2.0 million shares for 35.7 million at an average price paid per share of 17.85. 
 
 Contingent Consideration and Earnout. The fair value as of September 30, 2024 for the contingent consideration related to the CreditIQ and AccuTrade acquisitions was 0.5 million. 
 
 Within the next twelve months, we expect to pay 11.6 million of potential contingent consideration and D2C Media earnout discussed below. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we paid 30.4 million related to contingent consideration and earnout, which reduced the corresponding liability. The contingent consideration and earnout consists of the following: 
 
 The contingent consideration associated with the CreditIQ acquisition is based on two achievement objectives, including an earnings-related metric and lender market share. The actual amount to be paid will be based on the future performance of the acquired business to be attained over a three-year performance period through December 2024. 

The contingent consideration associated with the AccuTrade acquisition is based on achievement of an earnings-related metric. For the AccuTrade contingent consideration, we have the option to pay consideration in cash or certain amounts in stock, which may result in a variable number of shares being issued in accordance with a calculation based on future share prices.

This amendment is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2026, and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2027, on a prospective basis and early adoption and retrospective application is permitted. We are currently evaluating this new guidance and its impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements and related disclosures.

The standard also requires disclosure of income taxes paid disaggregated by jurisdiction with separate disclosure of income taxes paid to individual jurisdictions that meet a quantitative threshold.

 Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can only provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives, and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. During the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act).
