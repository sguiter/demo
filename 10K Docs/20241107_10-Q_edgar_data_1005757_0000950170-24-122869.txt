The typical warranty period is from the date of acceptance of the solution or offering. For certain service offerings we provide a warranty for the duration of the services provided. We generally warrant that those services will be performed in a professional and skillful manner. The typical remedy for breach of warranty is to correct or replace any defective deliverable, and if not possible or practical, we will accept the return of the defective deliverable and refund the amount paid under the customer arrangement that is allocable to the defective deliverable. Our contracts also generally contain limitation of damages provisions in an effort to reduce our exposure to monetary damages arising from breach of warranty claims. Historically, we have incurred minimal warranty costs, and as a result, do not maintain a warranty reserve. Solution and Services Indemnifications. Arrangements with our customers generally include an indemnification provision that will indemnify and defend a customer in actions brought against the customer that claim our products and/or services infringe upon a copyright, trade secret, or valid patent. Historically, we have not incurred any significant costs related to such indemnification claims, and as a result, do not maintain a reserve for such exposure.

Dilutive effect of restricted common stock 

Diluted weighted-average common shares 

The dilutive effect of restricted common stock is computed using the treasury stock method. The dilutive effect of the 2023 Convertible Notes is computed using the if-converted method and will only have an effect in those quarterly periods in which our average stock price exceeds the current effective conversion price. Potentially dilutive common shares related to non-participating unvested restricted stock and stock warrants were excluded from the computation of diluted EPS, as the effect was anti-dilutive, and were not material in any period presented. 

 shares of our common stock for million (weighted-average price of per share), and approximately shares of our common stock for million (weighted-average price of per share), respectively, under a SEC Rule 10b5-1 Plan.

In August 2024, our Board authorized an additional million of repurchases under the Stock Repurchase Program. This, combined with the remaining value from the prior Board authorization in August 2023, leaves million remaining value of shares available for repurchase at September 30, 2024 , with the amount authorized for repurchase through .

(1) Transaction fees are primarily comprised of fees paid to third-party payment processors and financial institutions and interchange fees under our payment services contracts. Transaction fees are included in revenue in our Income Statement (and not netted against revenue) because we maintain control and act as the principal over the integrated service provided under our payment services customer contracts. 

(2) Restructuring and reorganization charges include stock-based compensation, which is not included in the stock-based compensation line in the table above, and depreciation, which has not been recorded to the depreciation line on our Income Statement. 

Revenue. Revenue for the third quarter of 2024 was 295.1 million, a 2.9 increase when compared to revenue of 286.9 million for the third quarter of 2023. The increase in revenue is primarily attributed to continued growth of our SaaS and related solutions revenue to include the revenue generated from the businesses acquired in the second quarter of 2024, which more than offset lower software and services revenue for the quarter. 
 Operating Results. Operating income for the third quarter of 2024 was 31.8 million, or a 10.8 operating margin percentage, compared to 32.7 million, or an 11.4 operating margin percentage for the third quarter of 2023. The decrease in operating income is mainly attributed to the increase in acquisition-related expenses in the third quarter of 2024, to include earn-out compensation and amortization of acquired intangible assets. 
 Diluted EPS. Diluted EPS for the third quarter of 2024 was 0.67 compared to 0.62 for the third quarter of 2023, with the third quarter of 2024 benefiting from a lower effective income tax rate and a lower share count, partially offset by foreign currency movements. 
 Cash and Cash Flows. As of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of 118.4 million, as compared to 110.4 million as of June 30, 2024 and 186.3 million as of December 31, 2023. Our cash flows provided by operating activities for the third quarter of 2024 were 39.5 million. See the Liquidity section below for further discussion of our cash flows. 
 Significant Customer Relationships 
 A large percentage of our revenue is generated from a limited number of customers in the global communications industry, with our three largest customers being Charter Communications Inc. Charter ), Comcast, and DISH Network L.L.C. 
 Customer Concentration. We have significant customer concentration, with the following two customers exceeding 10 of our revenue (in thousands, except percentages):

See our 2023 10-K for additional discussion of our business relationships and contractual terms with Charter and Comcast. 
 Comcast . On October 30, 2024, we entered into an amendment to our current agreement with Comcast (the Amended Agreement ). The key terms of the Amended Agreement are as follows: 
 The Amended Agreement extends our contractual relationship with Comcast through December 31, 2030. 

The fees to be generated under the Amended Agreement will be based primarily on monthly charges for SaaS and related solutions per Comcast residential customer account, and various other ancillary services based on actual usage. The Amended Agreement includes annual price escalators beginning in 2026 and certain of the per-unit fees include volume-based pricing tiers. We did not provide a renewal discount to Comcast in the Amended Agreement. 

The Amended Agreement contains certain financial commitments associated with the number of Comcast residential customer accounts that are to be processed on our solutions. 

We maintain the exclusive right to provide print and mail services to all Comcast residential customer accounts through the term of the Amended Agreement. 

The Amended Agreement contains certain rights and obligations of both parties, including the following key items: (i) the termination of the agreement under certain conditions; (ii) various service level commitments; and (iii) remedies and limitations on liabilities associated with specified breaches of contractual obligations. 

A copy of the Amended Agreement, with confidential information redacted, will be filed as an exhibit to our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024. 
 Risk of Customer Concentration. We expect to continue to generate a large percentage of our future revenue from a limited number of customers. There are inherent risks whenever a large percentage of total revenue is concentrated with a limited number of customers. Should a significant customer: (i) terminate or fail to renew their contracts with us, in whole or in part, for any reason; (ii) significantly reduce the number of customer accounts processed on our solutions, the price paid for our services, or the scope of services that we provide; or (iii) experience financial or operating difficulties, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations. 
 Critical Accounting Policies 
 The preparation of our Financial Statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to select appropriate accounting policies, and to make judgments and estimates affecting the application of those accounting policies. In applying our accounting policies, different business conditions or the use of different assumptions may result in materially different amounts reported in our Financial Statements. 
 We have identified the most critical accounting policies that affect our financial position and the results of our operations. Those critical accounting policies were determined by considering the accounting policies that involve the most complex or subjective decisions or assessments. The most critical accounting policies identified relate to the following items: (i) revenue recognition; (ii) impairment assessments of long-lived assets; (iii) income taxes; and (iv) loss contingencies. These critical accounting policies, as well as our other significant accounting policies, are discussed in our 2023 10-K. 
 Results of Operations 
 Revenue. Total revenue for the: (i) third quarter of 2024 was 295.1 million, a 2.9 increase when compared to 286.9 million for the third quarter of 2023; and (ii) nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 880.6 million, a 1.0 increase when compared to 871.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

The increases in revenue are primarily attributed to continued growth of our SaaS and related solutions revenue, to include the revenue generated from the businesses acquired during the second quarter of 2024 (see Note 5 to our Financial Statements). These acquired businesses contributed approximately 6 million and 9 million, respectively, of revenue during the third quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024. These increases were offset to a certain degree by lower software and services revenue, to include the software license revenue resulting from the closure of approximately 10 million of license upgrades in the first quarter of 2023. 
 We use the location of the customer as the basis of attributing revenue to individual countries. Revenue by geographic regions for the third quarters and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was as follows (in thousands):

Total Operating Expenses. Total operating expenses for the: (i) third quarter of 2024 were 263.3 million, a 3.6 increase when compared to 254.1 million for the third quarter of 2023; and (ii) nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 791.6 million, a 2.4 increase when compared to 772.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increases in total operating expenses are a result of the higher SaaS and related solutions revenue between periods and the additional costs from the acquired businesses, to include acquired intangible asset amortization and earn-out compensation, in addition to the increases in restructuring and reorganization charges, discussed below. 
 The components of total operating expenses are discussed in more detail below. 
 Cost of Revenue (Exclusive of Depreciation). The cost of revenue for the: (i) third quarter of 2024 was 149.5 million, a 2.1 decrease when compared to 152.7 million for the third quarter of 2023; and (ii) nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 460.3 million, a 0.3 increase when compared to 458.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 The decrease in cost of revenue during the third quarter of 2024 is mainly attributed to lower employee-related costs, due to the reallocation of resources to development projects and an increase in deferred costs related to SaaS implementation projects. This decrease is partially offset by the increased costs reflective of the increase in SaaS and related solutions revenue between periods, to include the acquired businesses. 

The increase in cost of revenue during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 is reflective of the increase in SaaS and related solutions revenue year-over-year, to include the acquired businesses, offset by a decrease in employee-related costs, due to the reallocation of resources to development projects, and an increase in deferred costs related to SaaS implementation projects. 

Total cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue for the: (i) third quarters of 2024 and 2023 was 50.6 and 53.2 , respectively; and (ii) nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 52.3 and 52.6 , respectively. 
 20 

R D Expense (Exclusive of Depreciation) . R D expense for the: (i) third quarter of 2024 was 41.7 million, an 18.1 increase when compared to 35.3 million for the third quarter of 2023; and (ii) nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 116.2 million, an 8.2 increase when compared to 107.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increases in R D expense between periods are mainly attributed to increased employee-related costs. During 2024 our R D investment increased from prior periods as a result of the continued development of our SaaS platforms as we gain further traction in new industry verticals along with the integration of the recently acquired businesses into our solutions. These investments are focused on the continued evolution of our solutions that enable us to launch, monetize, and scale new digital services quickly and across any channel, while delivering an exceptional customer experience. 
 As a percentage of total revenue, R D expense for the: (i) third quarters of 2024 and 2023 was 14.1 and 12.3 , respectively; and (ii) nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 13.2 and 12.3 , respectively. 
 Selling, General, and Administrative ("SG A") Expense (Exclusive of Depreciation) . SG A expense for the: (i) third quarter of 2024 was 63.9 million, an 8.1 increase when compared to 59.1 million for the third quarter of 2023; and (ii) nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 186.8 million, a 3.2 increase when compared to 180.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increases in SG A expense are mainly attributed to increased employee-related costs, to include stock-based compensation and acquisition-related earn-out compensation. 
 As a percentage of total revenue, SG A expense for the: (i) third quarters of 2024 and 2023 was 21.7 and 20.6 , respectively; and (ii) nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 21.2 and 20.8 , respectively. 
 Restructuring and Reorganization Charges . Restructuring and reorganization charges for the: (i) third quarter of 2024 was 2.9 million, a 1.7 million increase when compared to 1.2 million for the third quarter of 2023; and (ii) nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 12.0 million, a 3.6 million increase when compared to 8.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The restructuring and reorganization charges for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 relate mainly to initiatives to better align and allocate resources to areas of the business where we have identified growth opportunities, which have resulted in restructuring charges related to involuntary terminations of 9.6 million. 
 
 See Note 6 to our Financial Statements for additional discussion. 
 Operating Income. Operating income for the: (i) third quarter of 2024 was 31.8 million, or 10.8 of total revenue, compared to 32.7 million, or 11.4 of total revenue for the third quarter of 2023; and (ii) nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 89.0 million, or 10.1 of total revenue, compared to 99.1 million, or 11.4 of total revenue, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 The decrease in operating income for the third quarter of 2024 is mainly attributed to the increase in acquisition-related expenses in the third quarter of 2024, to include earn-out compensation and amortization of acquired intangible assets. 

The decrease in operating income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 is mainly attributed to: (i) the higher software license revenue recognized during the first quarter of 2023, as the cost associated with this revenue is not generally dependent upon the timing of deal closures; (ii) the increase in acquisition-related expenses to include earn-out compensation and amortization of acquired intangible assets; and (iii) higher restructuring and reorganization charges. 

Interest Income. Interest income for the: (i) third quarter of 2024 was 1.9 million, a 0.7 million increase when compared to 1.2 million for the third quarter of 2023; and (ii) nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 6.6 million, a 4.1 million increase when compared to 2.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, with the increase primarily attributed to certain settlement assets being swept into overnight money market accounts on a daily basis. 
 Other, net . Other, net for the: (i) third quarter of 2024 was 2.2 million of other expense, a 3.0 million change when compared to 0.8 million of other income for the third quarter of 2023; and (ii) nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 1.5 million of other expense, a 1.5 million change when compared to 3.0 million of other expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, with the changes primarily attributed to foreign currency movements. 
 Income Tax Provision . The effective income tax rates for the: (i) third quarters of 2024 and 2023 were 20 and 30 , respectively; and (ii) nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 26 and 29 , respectively. The third quarter of 2024 effective income tax rate benefited from the revaluation of certain deferred income taxes. Our estimated full year 2024 effective income tax rate is approximately 28 , consistent with our 2023 full year effective income tax rate.

Liquidity 
 Cash and Liquidity. As of September 30, 2024, our principal sources of liquidity included cash and cash equivalents of 118.4 million, compared to 110.4 million as of June 30, 2024, and 186.3 million as of December 31, 2023. 
 As part of our 2021 Credit Agreement, we have a 450.0 million senior secured revolving loan facility with a syndicate of financial institutions that expires in September 2026, the 2021 Revolver. As of September 30, 2024, we had no borrowings outstanding on the 2021 Revolver balance, and have issued standby letters of credit for 1.5 million that count against the available 2021 Revolver balance, leaving 448.5 million available to us. The 2021 Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative, negative, and financial covenants. As of September 30, 2024, and the date of this filing, we believe we are in compliance with the provisions of the 2021 Credit Agreement. 
 Our cash and cash equivalents balances as of the end of the indicated periods were located in the following geographical regions (in thousands):

We generally have ready access to substantially all of our cash and cash equivalents, but may face limitations on moving cash out of certain foreign jurisdictions due to currency controls and potential negative economic consequences. 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had 1.8 million and 2.9 million, respectively, of cash restricted as to use primarily to collateralize guarantees included in our other current and non-current asset balances. In addition, as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had 240.8 million and 274.7 million, respectively, of settlement and merchant reserve assets which are deemed restricted due to contractual restrictions with the merchants and restrictions arising from our policy and intention. It has historically been our policy to segregate settlement and merchant reserve assets from our operating cash balances and we intend to continue to do so. 
 Cash Flows from Operating Activities. We calculate our cash flows from operating activities beginning with net income, adding back the impact of non-cash items or non-operating activity (e.g., depreciation, amortization, impairments, gain/loss on items such as investments, lease modifications, and debt extinguishments/conversions, unrealized foreign currency transactions gain/loss, deferred income taxes, stock-based compensation, etc.), and then factoring in the impact of changes in operating assets and liabilities. See our 2023 10-K for a description of the primary uses and sources of our cash flows from operating activities. 
 Our cash flows from operating activities, broken out between operations and changes in operating assets and liabilities, for the indicated quarterly periods are as follows (in thousands):

(1) Cash flows from operating activities for the first quarter of 2024 were negatively impacted by unfavorable working capital changes, to include the impact of the payment of the 2023 year-end accrued employee incentive compensation and timing of trade accounts receivable. 

(2) Cash flows from operating activities for the first quarter 2023 reflect the impact of the payment of the 2022 year-end accrued employee incentive compensation.

Variations in our net cash provided by/(used in) operating activities are generally related to the changes in our operating assets and liabilities (related mostly to fluctuations in timing at quarter-end of customer payments, billing milestones, and changes in accrued expenses), and generally over longer periods of time, do not significantly impact our cash flows from operations. 
 Significant fluctuations in key operating assets and liabilities between 2024 and 2023 that impacted our cash flows from operating activities are as follows: 
 Billed Trade Accounts Receivable 
 Management of our billed trade accounts receivable is one of the primary factors in maintaining strong cash flows from operating activities. These balances include significant billings for several non-revenue items (primarily postage, sales tax, and deferred revenue items). As a result, we evaluate our performance in collecting our billed trade accounts receivable through our calculation of Days Billings Outstanding DBO rather than a typical Days Sales Outstanding DSO calculation. 
 Our gross and net billed trade accounts receivable and related allowance for expected losses Allowance as of the end of the indicated quarterly periods, and the related DBOs for the quarters then ended, are as follows (in thousands, except DBOs):

As of September 30, 2024 and 2023, approximately 95 and 93 , respectively, of our net billed trade accounts receivable balances were less than 60 days past due. 
 We may experience adverse impacts to our DBOs if and when customer payment delays occur. However, the recurring monthly payments that cross a reporting period-end do not raise collectability concerns, as payment is generally received subsequent to quarter-end. All other changes in our gross and net billed accounts receivable reflect the normal fluctuations in the timing of customer payments at quarter-end, as evidenced by our relatively consistent DBO metric. 
 As a global provider of solutions and services, a portion of our trade accounts receivable balance relates to international customers. This diversity in the geographic composition of our customer base may adversely impact our DBOs as longer billing cycles (i.e., billing terms and cash collection cycles) are an inherent characteristic of international software and professional services transactions. As a result, we may experience fluctuations in our trade accounts receivable balance as our ability to invoice and collect arrangement fees is dependent upon, among other things: (i) the completion of various customer administrative matters, local country billing protocols and processes (including local cultural differences), and non-customer administrative matters; (ii) meeting certain contractual invoicing milestones and dates; (iii) the overall project status in certain situations in which we act as a subcontractor to another vendor on a project; or (iv) currency controls in certain foreign jurisdictions. 
 Unbilled Trade Accounts Receivable 
 Unbilled trade accounts receivable increased 0.4 million to 82.6 million as of September 30, 2024, from 82.2 million as of December 31, 2023. These unbilled trade accounts receivable balances relate primarily to large implementation projects where various milestone and contractual billing dates have not yet been reached or are delayed. Unbilled trade accounts receivable are an inherent characteristic of certain software and services transactions and may fluctuate between quarters, as these types of transactions typically have scheduled invoicing terms over several quarters, as well as certain milestone billing events. 
 Income Taxes Payable/Receivable 
 Net income taxes payable/receivable (current and non-current) as of September 30, 2024 was a net income taxes receivable balance of 10.4 million, compared to a net income taxes payable balance of 5.8 million as of December 31, 2023. This net 16.2 million change is primarily due to the timing of our estimated federal and state income tax payments. 
 23 

Accrued Employee Compensation 
 Accrued employee compensation decreased 26.7 million to 57.7 million as of September 30, 2024, from 84.4 million as of December 31, 2023, due primarily to the payment of the 2023 employee incentive compensation during the first quarter of 2024 that was fully accrued at December 31, 2023 and the timing of accrued wages, partially offset by the accruals for the 2024 employee incentive compensation. 
 Cash Flows From Investing Activities. Our typical investing activities consist of purchases of software, property, and equipment, and in 2024, our business combination activities, which are discussed below. 
 Purchases of Software, Property, and Equipment 
 Our capital expenditures for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 for software, property, and equipment were 16.5 million and 22.9 million, respectively, and consisted principally of investments in: (i) communication design and delivery center equipment and infrastructure; (ii) software and related equipment; (iii) computer hardware; and (iv) lease improvements. 
 Business Combinations, net of Cash and Settlement Assets Acquired 
 The cash paid for the acquisitions discussed in Note 5 to our Financial Statements, less cash and settlement assets acquired, resulted in net cash provided by business combinations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 of 17.3 million. 
 Cash Flows From Financing Activities. Our financing activities typically consist of activities with our common stock, various debt-related transactions, and settlement and merchant reserve activity. 
 Cash Dividends Paid on Common Stock 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, our Board approved dividends totaling 26.4 million for both periods, and we made dividend payments of 26.6 million and 26.2 million, respectively, with the differences between the amount approved and paid attributed to dividends accrued on unvested incentive shares that are paid upon vesting. 
 Repurchase of Common Stock 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we repurchased approximately 716,000 and 1,991,000 shares of our common stock, respectively, under our Stock Repurchase Program for 33.7 million and 107.0 million, respectively. 
 Additionally, outside of our Stock Repurchase Program, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we repurchased from our employees and then canceled approximately 172,000 and 171,000 shares of our common stock, respectively, for 9.1 million and 9.6 million, respectively, in connection with minimum tax withholding requirements resulting from the vesting of restricted stock under our stock incentive plans. 
 Through the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we have paid 42.4 million and 116.4 million, respectively, for our total repurchases of common stock, with any differences when compared to the amounts purchased attributed to the timing of the settlement and the accrued excise tax imposed as part of the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act. 
 See Note 9 to our Financial Statements for additional discussion of our repurchases of common stock. 
 Long-Term Debt 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we made principal repayments on our 2021 Term Loan of 5.6 million during each period. Additionally, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we borrowed and subsequently repaid 15.0 million from our 2021 Revolver for general corporate purposes. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we borrowed 45.0 million under our 2021 Revolver for general corporate purposes and subsequently repaid 30.0 million. In September 2023, we issued the 2023 Convertible Notes offering and received proceeds of 425.0 million. We used a portion of these proceeds to repay 275.0 million of our 2021 Revolver balance and pay the 34.3 million premiums for the Capped Call Transactions. Additionally, during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we paid deferred financing costs of 13.5 million. 
 See Note 4 to our Financial Statements for additional discussion of our long-term debt. 
 24 

Settlement and Merchant Reserve Activity 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we had net settlement and merchant reserve activity of (79.6) million and 46.2) million, respectively, related to the cash collected, held on behalf, and paid to our merchants related to our payments services and the net change in deposits held on behalf of our merchants. These balances can significantly fluctuate between periods due to activity at the end of the period and the day in which the period ends. 
 See Note 2 to our Financial Statements for additional discussion of our settlement and merchant reserves. 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 Our off-balance sheet arrangements are mainly limited to money transmitter bonds, bid bonds, performance bonds, and standby letters of credit. These arrangements do not have a material impact and are not reasonably likely to have a material future impact to our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources. See Note 7 to our Financial Statements for additional information on these guarantees. 
 Capital Resources 
 The following are the key items to consider in assessing our sources and uses of capital resources: 
 Current Sources of Capital Resources. Below are the key items to consider in assessing our current sources of capital resources: 
 Cash and Cash Equivalents. As of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of 118.4 million, of which approximately 62 was in U.S. dollars and held in the U.S. For the remainder of the monies denominated in foreign currencies and/or located outside the U.S., we do not anticipate any material amounts being unavailable for use in funding our business, but may face limitations on moving cash out of certain foreign jurisdictions due to currency controls and potential negative economic consequences. 

Operating Cash Flows. As described in the Liquidity section above, we believe we have the ability to generate strong cash flows to fund our operating activities and act as a source of funds for our capital resource needs, although we may experience quarterly variations in our cash flows from operations related to the changes in our operating assets and liabilities. 

Revolving Loan Facility. As part of our 2021 Credit Agreement, we have a 450.0 million revolving loan facility, the 2021 Revolver. As of September 30, 2024, we had no borrowings outstanding on the 2021 Revolver and issued standby letters of credit for 1.5 million that count against the available 2021 Revolver balance, currently leaving 448.5 million available to us. Our long-term debt obligations are discussed in more detail in Note 4 to our Financial Statements. 

Uses/Potential Uses of Capital Resources. Below are the key items to consider in assessing our uses/potential uses of capital resources: 
 Common Stock Repurchases and Cash Dividends. We have made repurchases of our common stock in the past under our Stock Repurchase Program. In August of 2024, our Board authorized an additional 100.0 million of repurchases under our Stock Repurchase Program, with all outstanding authorized repurchases to be completed by December 31, 2025. As of September 30, 2024, we had 162.0 million authorized for repurchase remaining under our Stock Repurchase Program. Our 2021 Credit Agreement places certain limitations on our ability to repurchase our common stock. 

Under our Stock Repurchase Program, we may repurchase shares in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions, including through an accelerated stock repurchase plan or under a SEC Rule 10b5-1 plan. The actual timing and amount of share repurchases are dependent on the current market conditions and other business-related factors. Our common stock repurchases are discussed in more detail in Note 9 to our Financial Statements. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we repurchased approximately 716,000 shares of our common stock for 33.7 million (weighted-average price of 47.07 per share). 
 Outside of our Stock Repurchase Program, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we repurchased from our employees and then cancelled approximately 172,000 shares of our common stock for 9.1 million in connection with minimum tax withholding requirements resulting from the vesting of restricted common stock under our stock incentive plans. 
 25 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Board declared dividends totaling 26.4 million. Going forward, we expect to pay cash dividends each year in March, June, September, and December, with the amount and timing subject to our Board s approval. 
 We expect to return a total of 100.0 million to our shareholders through combined common stock repurchases and cash dividends in each of 2024 and 2025. 
 Acquisitions. As a result of our previous acquisition activity, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 we made 2.5 million of deferred acquisition payments. We expect to pay 0.3 million in 2025 related to these past acquisitions. Additionally, there are provisions for up to approximately 13 million of potential future earn-out payments. The earn-out period was originally through September 30, 2025, but during the third quarter of 2024 was extended through December 31, 2026. As of September 30, 2024, we have accrued 0.1 million related to potential earn-out payments. 

During the second quarter of 2024, we acquired two businesses, discussed in further detail in Note 5 to our Financial Statements. The acquisition date fair value of the consideration transferred totaled 32.6 million, subject to customary working capital adjustments. The iCG Pay purchase agreement includes provisions for up to 15.0 million of potential future earn-out payments tied to performance-based goals and a defined service period. The earn-out period is through June 3, 2027. As of September 30, 2024, we have accrued 3.5 million related to potential earn-out payments. These acquisitions were funded with available cash. 
 As part of our growth strategy, we are continually evaluating potential business and/or asset acquisitions and investments in market share expansion with our existing and potential new customer s and expansion into verticals outside the global communications market. 
 Exit of Reseller Agreements. During 2023, we exited out of two reseller agreements that were acquired with the 2018 acquisition of Forte Payment Systems, Inc., at a total cost of 9.9 million, of which 1.8 million was paid in 2023. We paid an additional 5.6 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Of the remaining 2.5 million, 1.3 million will be paid in 2025 and 1.2 million will be paid in 2026. 

Capital Expenditures. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we spent 16.5 million on capital expenditures. 

Financing Agreements. We have financing agreements for certain of our internal use software. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we paid 2.2 million related to these financing agreements, with an additional 1.4 million to be paid in 2024, 4.6 million to be paid in 2025, 3.6 million to be paid in 2026, and 0.9 million to be paid in 2027. 

Long-Term Debt. As of September 30, 2024, our long-term debt consisted of the following: (i) 2023 Convertible Notes in the principal aggregate amount of 425.0 million; and (ii) 2021 Credit Agreement term loan borrowings of 127.5 million. 

2023 Convertible Notes. The 2023 Convertible Notes are convertible at the option of the note holders before June 15, 2028 upon the occurrence of certain events, however, there are no scheduled conversion triggers over the next twelve months. As a result, we expect our required debt service cash outlay during the next twelve months for the 2023 Convertible Notes to be limited to interest payments of 16.5 million. 
 2021 Credit Agreement. The mandatory repayments under our 2021 Credit Agreement for the next twelve months are 7.5 million and the cash interest expense (based upon then-current interest rates) for the 2021 Term Loan is 7.7 million. We have the ability to make prepayments without penalties on our 2021 Credit Agreement. 
 Our long-term debt obligations are discussed in more detail in Note 4 to our Financial Statements. 
 In summary, we expect to continue to have material needs for capital resources going forward, as noted above. We believe that our current cash and cash equivalents balances and our 2021 Revolver, together with cash expected to be generated in the future from our current operating activities, will be sufficient to meet our anticipated capital resource requirements for at least the next twelve months. We believe we could obtain additional capital through other debt sources which may be available to us if deemed appropriate. 
 26 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qual itative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 Market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices. As of September 30, 2024, we are exposed to various market risks, including changes in interest rates, fluctuations and changes in the market value of our cash equivalents and settlement and merchant reserve assets, and changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We have not historically entered into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 Long-Term Debt. The interest rate on our 2023 Convertible Notes is fixed, and thus, as it relates to our convertible debt borrowings, we are not exposed to changes in interest rates. 
 The interest rates on our 2021 Credit Agreement are based upon an adjusted SOFR rate (including a 0.10 credit spread adjustment) plus an applicable margin, or an ABR plus an applicable margin. See Note 4 to our Financial Statements for further details related to our long-term debt. 
 A hypothetical adverse change of 10 in the September 30, 2024 adjusted SOFR rate would not have a material impact upon our results of operations. 
 Market Risk 
 Cash and Cash Equivalents. Our cash and cash equivalents as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were 118.4 million and 186.3 million, respectively. Certain of our cash balances are swept into overnight money market accounts on a daily basis, and at times, any excess funds are invested in low-risk, somewhat longer term, cash equivalent instruments. Our cash equivalents are invested primarily in institutional money market funds held at major banks. We have minimal market risk for our cash and cash equivalents due to the relatively short maturities of the instruments. 
 Settlement and Merchant Reserve Assets. We are exposed to market risk associated with cash held on behalf of our merchants related to our payment processing services. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had 240.8 million and 274.7 million, respectively, of cash collected on behalf of our merchants. The cash is held in accounts with various major financial institutions in the U.S. and Canada in an amount equal to at least 100 of the aggregate amount owed to our merchants. These balances can significantly fluctuate between periods due to activity at the end of the period and the day in which the period ends. Certain settlement assets are swept into overnight money market accounts on a daily basis. 
 Long-Term Debt. The fair value of our convertible debt is exposed to market risk. We do not carry our convertible debt at fair value but present the fair value for disclosure purposes (see Note 2 to our Financial Statements). Generally, the fair value of our convertible debt is impacted by changes in interest rates and changes in the price and volatility of our common stock. As of September 30, 2024, the fair value of the 2023 Convertible Notes was estimated at 426.0 million, using quoted market prices. 
 Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk 
 Due to foreign operations around the world, our financial statements are exposed to foreign currency exchange risk due to the fluctuations in the value of currencies in which we conduct business. Our principal currency exposures include the British Pound, Euro, Australian Dollar, Saudi Riyal, and South African Rand. While we attempt to maximize natural hedges by incurring expenses in the same currency in which we contract revenue, the related expenses for that revenue could be in one or more differing currencies than the revenue stream. In particular, if the U.S. Dollar were to strengthen it would reduce the reported amount of our foreign-denominated cash, cash equivalents, trade receivables, revenue, and expenses that we translate into U.S. Dollars and report in our consolidated financial statements for, and as of the end of, each reporting period. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we generated approximately 90 of our revenue in U.S. dollars. We expect that, in the foreseeable future, we will continue to generate a very large percentage of our revenue in U.S. dollars. 
 We have analyzed our foreign currency exposure as of September 30, 2024. A hypothetical adverse change of 10 in the September 30, 2024 exchange rates would not have had a material impact upon our results of operations. 
 Item 4. Controls an d Procedures 
 (a) Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 As required by Rule 13a-15(b), our management, including the Chief Executive Officer CEO and Chief Financial Officer CFO ), conducted an evaluation as of the end of the period covered by this report of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rule 13a-15(e). Based on that evaluation, the CEO and CFO concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report. 
 27 

(b) Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 As required by Rule 13a-15(d), our management, including the CEO and CFO, also conducted an evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting, as defined by Rule 13a-15(f), to determine whether any changes occurred during the quarter covered by this report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Based on that evaluation, the CEO and CFO concluded that there has been no such change during the quarter covered by this report.
