Notes
to the Financial Statements (Unaudited) 

Shares (also referred to as Baskets in exchange for deposits of silver and distributes silver in connection with the redemption of Baskets. Shares
represent units of fractional undivided beneficial interest in and ownership of the Trust which are issued by the Trust. The Sponsor
is a Delaware limited liability company and a wholly-owned subsidiary of abrdn Inc., which is a wholly-owned indirect subsidiary
of abrdn plc. The Trust is governed by the Trust Agreement. 

The
investment objective of the Trust is for the Shares to reflect the performance of the price of physical silver, less
the Trust s expenses. The Trust is designed to provide an individual owner of beneficial interests in the Shares (a
 Shareholder an opportunity to participate in the silver market through an investment in securities. The fiscal
year end for the Trust is December 31. 

The
accompanying financial statements were prepared in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America ("U.S. GAAP") for interim financial information and with the instructions for Form 10-Q. In the opinion
of the Trust s management, all adjustments (which consist of normal recurring adjustments) necessary to present fairly the financial
position and results of operations as of and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, and for all periods
presented have been made. 

These
financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Trust s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December
31, 2023. The results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 are not necessarily indicative of the
operating results for the full year. 

The
Trust s silver is recorded at fair value. The cost of silver is determined according to the average cost method and the fair value
is based on the London Bullion Market Association ("LBMA") Silver Price. Realized gains and losses on transfers
of silver, or silver distributed for the redemption of Shares, are calculated on a trade date basis as the difference between
the fair value and average cost of silver transferred. 

The
ICE Benchmark Administration IBA conducts an electronic, over-the-counter silver auction in London, England to
establish a fixing price for an ounce of silver once each trading day, which is disseminated by major market vendors (the LBMA
Silver Price ). The LBMA Silver Price is established by the LBMA-authorized bullion banks and market makers participating
in the auction. 

Once
the value of silver has been determined, the net asset value (the NAV is computed by the Trustee by
deducting all accrued fees, expenses and other liabilities of the Trust, including the remuneration due to the Sponsor (the Sponsor s
Fee ), from the fair value of the silver and all other assets held by the Trust. 

The
Trust recognizes changes in fair value of the investment in silver as changes in unrealized gains or losses on investment
in silver through the Statement of Operations. 

The
per Share amount of silver exchanged for a purchase or redemption is calculated daily by the Trustee using the LBMA Silver
Price to calculate the silver amount in respect of any liabilities for which covering silver sales have not yet been
made, and represents the per Share amount of silver held by the Trust, after giving effect to its liabilities, to cover expenses
and liabilities and any losses that may have occurred. 

Fair
Value Hierarchy 

ASC
820 establishes a hierarchy that prioritizes inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The three levels of inputs
are as follows: 

Level 1. 
 Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets
or liabilities that the Trust has the ability to access. 

Level 2. 
 Observable inputs other than quoted prices included in
level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability either directly or indirectly. These inputs may include quoted prices for the identical instrument
on an inactive market, prices for similar instruments and similar data. 

Level 3. 
 Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability to the
extent that relevant observable inputs are not available, representing the Trust s own assumptions about the assumptions that a
market participant would use in valuing the asset or liability, and that would be based on the best information available. 

To
the extent that valuation is based on models or inputs that are less observable or unobservable in the market, the determination
of fair value requires more judgment. Accordingly, the degree of judgment exercised in determining fair value is greatest for
instruments categorized in level 3. 

The
inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In such cases, for disclosure purposes,
the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement falls in its entirety is determined based on the
lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. 

The
Trust s investment in silver is classified as a level 1 asset, as its value is calculated using unadjusted
quoted prices from primary market sources. 

There
were no transfers between levels during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 or the year ended December 31, 2023. 

silver receivable
or payable for the creation or redemption of Shares. At December 31, 2023, the Trust had silver receivable or
payable for the creation or redemption of Shares. 

The
amount of silver represented by the Baskets created or redeemed can only be settled to the nearest 1/1000th of an ounce.
As a result, the value attributed to the creation or redemption of Shares may differ from the value of silver to be
delivered or distributed by the Trust. In order to ensure that the correct amount of silver is available at all times to
back the Shares, the Sponsor accepts an adjustment to its Sponsor Fee in the event of any shortfall or excess on each
transaction. For each transaction, this amount is not more than 1/1000th of an ounce of silver. 

As
the Shares of the Trust are subject to redemption at the option of Authorized Participants, the Trust has classified the outstanding
Shares as Net Assets. Changes in the number of Shares outstanding are presented in the Statement of Changes in Net Assets. 

reserves for uncertain tax positions are required as of September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023.

of the adjusted daily net asset value ANAV of the Trust, paid monthly in arrears. Presently, the Sponsor
is continuing to voluntarily waive a portion of its fee and reduce the Sponsor s Fee to (which it has done since the
Date of Inception). 

The
Sponsor has agreed to assume administrative and marketing expenses incurred by the Trust, including the Trustee s monthly
fee and out of pocket expenses, the Custodian s fee and the reimbursement of the Custodian s expenses, exchange listing
fees, United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC registration fees, printing and mailing costs,
audit fees and up to per annum in legal expenses. 

For
the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Sponsor s Fee, net of fees waived by the Sponsor, was and ,

was and , respectively. 

At September
30, 2024 and at December 31, 2023, the fees payable to the Sponsor were and , respectively. 

As
a result of the waiver, the Sponsor s Fee waived for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was and
 , respectively. The Sponsor s Fee waived for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023 was and
 , respectively. 

With
respect to expenses not otherwise assumed by the Sponsor, the Trustee will, at the direction of the Sponsor or in its own discretion,
sell the Trust s silver as necessary to pay these expenses. When selling silver to pay expenses, the Trustee will endeavor
to sell the smallest amounts of silver needed to pay these expenses in order to minimize the Trust s holdings of assets
other than silver. Other than the Sponsor s Fee, the Trust had expenses during the three and nine months ended September
30, 2024 and 2023. 

Unless
otherwise directed by the Sponsor, when selling silver the Trustee will endeavor to sell at the LBMA Silver Price. The Trustee
will place orders with dealers (which may include the Custodian) through which the Trustee expects to receive the most favorable
price and execution of orders. The Custodian may be the purchaser of such silver only if the sale transaction is made at the next
LBMA Silver Price or such other publicly available price that the Sponsor deems fair, in each case as set following the sale order.
A gain or loss is recognized based on the difference between the selling price and the average cost of the silver sold. Neither
the Trustee nor the Sponsor is liable for depreciation or loss incurred by reason of any sale. 

Realized
gains and losses result from the transfer of silver for Share redemptions and / or to pay expenses and are recognized on a trade
date basis as the difference between the fair value and average cost of silver transferred.

1 of Part 1 of this Form 10-Q. The discussion and analysis that follows may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning
of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended,
and within the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, as amended. These forward-looking statements may relate to the
Trust s financial condition, operations, future performance and business. These statements can be identified by the use

to conform such statements to actual results or to reflect a change in management s expectations or predictions. 

Introduction 

The
Trust is a common law trust, formed under the laws of the state of New York on July 20, 2009. The Trust is not managed like
a corporation or an active investment vehicle. It does not have any officers, directors, or employees and is administered by the
Trustee pursuant to the Trust Agreement. The Trust is not registered as an investment company under the Investment Company Act
of 1940 and is not required to register under such act. It does not hold or trade in commodity futures contracts, nor is it a
commodity pool, or subject to regulation as a commodity pool operator or a commodity trading adviser in connection with issuing
Shares. 

The
Trust holds silver and is expected to issue Baskets in exchange for deposits of silver and to distribute silver
in connection with redemptions of Baskets. Shares issued by the Trust represent units of undivided beneficial interest in and
ownership of the Trust. The investment objective of the Trust is for the Shares to reflect the performance of the price of physical silver,
less the Trust s expenses. The Sponsor believes that, for many investors, the Shares will represent a cost effective
investment relative to traditional means of investing in silver. 

The
Trust issues and redeems Shares only with Authorized Participants in exchange for silver and only in aggregations of 50,000
Shares or integral multiples thereof. A list of current Authorized Participants is available from the Sponsor or the Trustee. 

Shares
of the Trust trade on the New York Stock Exchange (the NYSE Arca under the symbol SIVR . 

Valuation
of Silver and Computation of Net Asset Value 

On
each day that the NYSE Arca is open for regular trading, as promptly as practicable after 4:00 p.m. New York time on such day
(the Evaluation Time ), the Trustee evaluates the silver held by the Trust and determine both the ANAV and the
NAV of the Trust. 

At
the Evaluation Time, the Trustee values the Trust s silver on the basis of that day s LBMA Silver Price 
(the daily price of an ounce of silver determined by an electronic, over-the-counter auction that starts at 12:00 noon London,
England time in which LBMA-accredited bullion banks or market makers participate), or, if no LBMA Silver Price is made on such
day or has not been announced by the Evaluation Time, the next most recent LBMA Silver Price determined prior to the Evaluation
Time is used, unless the Sponsor determines that such price is inappropriate as a basis for evaluation. In the event the Sponsor
determines that the LBMA Silver Price or such other publicly available price as the Sponsor may deem fairly represents the commercial
value of the Trust s silver is not an appropriate basis for evaluation of the Trust s silver, it shall identify an
alternative basis for such evaluation to be employed by the Trustee. Neither the Trustee nor the Sponsor shall be liable to any
person for the determination that the LBMA Silver Price or such other publicly available price is not appropriate as a basis for
evaluation of the Trust s silver or for any determination as to the alternative basis for such evaluation provided that
such determination is made in good faith. 

Once
the value of the silver has been determined, the Trustee subtracts all estimated accrued but unpaid fees (other than the
fees accruing for such day on which the valuation takes place that are computed by reference to the value of the Trust or its
assets), expenses and other liabilities of the Trust from the total value of the silver and all other assets of the Trust. The
resulting figure is the adjusted net asset value (the ANAV of the Trust. The ANAV of the Trust is used to compute
the Sponsor s Fee. 

13 

All
fees accruing for the day on which the valuation takes place that are computed by reference to the value of the Trust or its assets
are calculated using the ANAV calculated for such day. The Trustee subtracts from the ANAV the amount of the accrued fees so computed
for such day and the resulting figure is the NAV of the Trust. The Trustee also determines the NAV per Share by dividing the NAV
of the Trust by the number of Shares outstanding as of the close of trading on the NYSE Arca (which includes the net number of
any Shares created or redeemed on such evaluation day). 

Any
estimate of the accrued but unpaid fees, expenses and liabilities of the Trust for purposes of computing the NAV of the Trust
and ANAV made by the Trustee in good faith shall be conclusive upon all persons interested in the Trust and no revision or correction
in any computation made under the Trust Agreement will be required by reason of any difference in amounts estimated from those
actually paid. 

The
NAV of the Trust is obtained by subtracting the Trust s liabilities on any day from the value of the silver owned and receivable
by the Trust on that day; the NAV per Share is obtained by dividing the NAV of the Trust on a given day by the number of Shares
outstanding on that day. 

The
Quarter Ended September 30, 2024 

The
Trust s NAV increased from 1,336,653,067 at June 30, 2024 to 1,453,261,073 at September 30, 2024, an 8.72 increase for
the quarter. The change in the Trust s NAV resulted from an increase in the price per ounce of silver, which rose 5.82 from 29.37
at June 30, 2024 to 31.08 at September 30, 2024 and an increase in outstanding Shares, which rose from 47,600,000 Shares at June
30, 2024 to 48,950,000 Shares at September 30, 2024 as a result of 2,400,000 Shares (48 Baskets) being created and 1,050,000 Shares
(21 Baskets) being redeemed during the quarter. 

The
NAV per Share increased 5.73 from 28.08 at June 30, 2024 to 29.69 at September 30, 2024. The Trust s NAV per Share rose
slightly less than the price per ounce of silver on a percentage basis due to the Sponsor s Fee, net of waiver, which was
 1,040,755 for the quarter, or 0.30 of the Trust s ANAV on an annualized basis. 

The
NAV per Share of 31.03 at September 26, 2024 was the highest during the quarter, compared with a low of 25.74 at August 8, 2024. 

The
increase in net assets from operations for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 was 79,795,336, resulting from a realized gain
of 253,435 on the transfer of silver to pay expenses, a realized gain on silver distributed for the redemption of Shares of 8,462,558,
and a change in unrealized gain on investment in silver of 72,120,098, offset by the Sponsor s Fee, net of waiver, of 1,040,755.
Other than the Sponsor s Fee, the Trust had no expenses during the quarter ended September 30, 2024. 

The
Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 

The
Trust s NAV increased from 1,060,402,598 at December 31, 2023 to 1,453,261,073 at September 30, 2024, a 37.05 increase
for the period. The change in the Trust s NAV resulted from an increase in the price per ounce of silver, which rose 30.64 
from 23.79 at December 31, 2023 to 31.08 at September 30, 2024 and an increase in outstanding Shares, which rose from 46,550,000
Shares at December 31, 2023 to 48,950,000 Shares at September 30, 2024, as a result of 4,250,000 Shares (85 Baskets) being created
and 1,850,000 Shares (37 Baskets) being redeemed during the period. 

The
NAV per Share increased 30.33 from 22.78 at December 31, 2023 to 29.69 at September 30, 2024. The Trust s NAV per Share
rose slightly less than the price per ounce of silver on a percentage basis due to the Sponsor s Fee, net of waiver, which
was 2,789,553 for the period, or 0.30 of the Trust s ANAV on an annualized basis. 

14 

The
NAV per Share of 31.03 on September 26, 2024 was the highest during the period, compared with a low of 21.14 at February 14, 2024. 

The
increase in net assets from operations for the period ended September 30, 2024 was 327,905,860, resulting from a realized gain
of 482,967 on the transfer of silver to pay expenses, a realized gain on silver distributed for the redemption of Shares of
 10,337,698, and a change in unrealized gain on investment in silver of 319,874,748, offset by the Sponsor s Fee, net of waiver,
of 2,789,553. Other than the Sponsor s Fee, the Trust had no expenses during the period ended September 30, 2024. 

Liquidity
 Capital Resources 

The
Trust is not aware of any trends, demands, commitments, events or uncertainties that are reasonably likely to result in material
changes to its liquidity needs. In exchange for the Sponsor s Fee, the Sponsor has agreed to assume most of the expenses
incurred by the Trust. As a result, the only ordinary expense of the Trust during the period covered by this report was the Sponsor s
Fee. 

The
Trustee will, at the direction of the Sponsor or in its own discretion, sell the Trust s silver as necessary to
pay the Trust s expenses not otherwise assumed by the Sponsor. The Trustee will not sell silver to pay the Sponsor s
Fee but will pay the Sponsor s Fee through in-kind transfers of silver to the Sponsor. At September 30, 2024,
the Trust did not have any cash balances. 

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements 

The
Trust has no off-balance sheet arrangements. 

Critical
Accounting Policies 

The
financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America. The preparation of these financial statements relies on estimates and assumptions that impact the Trust s
financial position and results of operations. These estimates and assumptions affect the Trust s application of accounting
policies. Refer to Note 2 to the Financial Statements for further information on accounting policies. 

Item
3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 

Not
applicable. 

Item
4. Controls and Procedures 

The
Trust maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in its
reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized
and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and
communicated to the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of the Sponsor, and to the audit committee, as appropriate,
to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Under
the supervision and with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer of the Sponsor, the
Sponsor conducted an evaluation of the Trust s disclosure controls and procedures, as defined under Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e)
and 15d-15(e). Based on this evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer of the Sponsor concluded
that, as of September 30, 2024, the Trust s disclosure controls and procedures were effective. 

There
have been no changes in the Trust s or Sponsor s internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September
30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Trust s or Sponsor s internal
control over financial reporting.
