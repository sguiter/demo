EXPLANATORY NOTE 
 This report combines the quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for the period ended September 30, 2024, of Prologis, Inc. and Prologis, L.P. Unless stated otherwise or the context otherwise requires, references to Prologis, Inc. or the Parent mean Prologis, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries; and references to Prologis, L.P. or the Operating Partnership or the OP mean Prologis, L.P., and its consolidated subsidiaries. The terms the Company, Prologis, we, our or us means the Parent and the OP collectively. 
 
 The Parent is a real estate investment trust (a REIT and the general partner of the OP. At September 30, 2024, the Parent owned a 97.59 common general partnership interest in the OP and substantially all of the preferred units in the OP. The remaining 2.41 common limited partnership interests are owned by unaffiliated investors and certain current and former directors and officers of the Parent. 
 
 We operate the Parent and the OP as one enterprise. The management of the Parent consists of the same members as the management of the OP. These members are officers of the Parent and employees of the OP or one of its subsidiaries. As sole general partner, the Parent has control of the OP through complete responsibility and discretion in the day-to-day management and therefore, consolidates the OP for financial reporting purposes. Because the only significant asset of the Parent is its investment in the OP, the assets and liabilities of the Parent and the OP are the same on their respective financial statements. 
 We believe combining the quarterly reports on Form 10-Q of the Parent and the OP into this single report results in the following benefits: 
 enhances investors understanding of the Parent and the OP by enabling investors to view the business as a whole in the same manner as management views and operates the business; 

eliminates duplicative disclosure and provides a more streamlined and readable presentation as a substantial portion of the Company s disclosure applies to both the Parent and the OP; and 

creates time and cost efficiencies through the preparation of one combined report instead of two separate reports. 

It is important to understand the few differences between the Parent and the OP in the context of how we operate the Company. The Parent does not conduct business itself, other than acting as the sole general partner of the OP and issuing public equity from time to time. The OP holds substantially all the assets of the business, directly or indirectly. The OP conducts the operations of the business and is structured as a partnership with no publicly traded equity. Except for net proceeds from equity issuances by the Parent, which are contributed to the OP in exchange for partnership units, the OP generates capital required by the business through the OP s operations, incurrence of indebtedness and issuance of partnership units to third parties. 
 
 The presentation of noncontrolling interests, stockholders equity and partners capital are the main areas of difference between the consolidated financial statements of the Parent and those of the OP. The differences in the presentations between stockholders equity and partners capital result from the differences in the equity and capital issuances in the Parent and in the OP. 
 
 The preferred stock, common stock, additional paid-in capital, accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and distributions in excess of net earnings of the Parent are presented as stockholders equity in the Parent s consolidated financial statements. These items represent the common and preferred general partnership interests held by the Parent in the OP and are presented as general partner s capital within partners capital in the OP s consolidated financial statements. The common limited partnership interests held by the limited partners in the OP are presented as noncontrolling interest within equity in the Parent s consolidated financial statements and as limited partners capital within partners capital in the OP s consolidated financial statements. 
 
 To highlight the differences between the Parent and the OP, separate sections in this report, as applicable, individually discuss the Parent and the OP, including separate financial statements and separate Exhibit 31 and 32 certifications. In the sections that combine disclosure of the Parent and the OP, this report refers to actions or holdings as being actions or holdings of Prologis.

 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 (Unaudited) 
 
 countries on continents. We invest in real estate through wholly owned subsidiaries and other entities through which we co-invest with partners and investors. We maintain a significant level of ownership in these co-investment ventures, which may be consolidated or unconsolidated based on our level of control of the entity. Our current business strategy consists of operating business segments: Real Estate (Rental Operations and Development) and Strategic Capital. Our Real Estate Segment represents the ownership, leasing and development of logistics properties. Our Strategic Capital Segment represents the management of properties owned by our unconsolidated co-investment ventures and other ventures. See Note 10 for further discussion of our business segments. Unless otherwise indicated, the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements apply to both the Parent and the OP. The terms the Company, Prologis, we, our or us means the Parent and OP collectively. For each share of preferred or common stock the Parent issues, the OP issues a corresponding preferred or common partnership unit, as applicable, to the Parent in exchange for the contribution of the proceeds from the stock issuance. At September 30, 2024, the Parent owned a common general partnership interest in the OP and substantially all of the preferred units in the OP. The remaining common limited partnership interests, which include Class A common limited partnership units Class A Units in the OP, are owned by unaffiliated investors and certain current and former directors and officers of the Parent. Each partner s percentage interest in the OP is determined based on the number of OP units held, including the number of OP units into which Class A Units are convertible, compared to total OP units outstanding at each period end and is used as the basis for the allocation of net income or loss to each partner. At the end of each reporting period, a capital adjustment is made in the OP to reflect the appropriate ownership interest for each of the common unitholders. These adjustments are reflected in the line items Reallocation of Equity in the Consolidated Statements of Equity of the Parent and Reallocation of Capital in the Consolidated Statements of Capital of the OP. As the sole general partner of the OP, the Parent has complete responsibility and discretion in the day-to-day management and control of the OP, and we operate the Parent and the OP as one enterprise. The management of the Parent consists of the same members as the management of the OP. These members are officers of the Parent and employees of the OP or one of its subsidiaries. As general partner with control of the OP, the Parent is the primary beneficiary and therefore consolidates the OP. Because the Parent s only significant asset is its investment in the OP, the assets and liabilities of the Parent and the OP are the same on their respective financial statements.

The performance hurdle Outperformance Hurdle at the end of the initial three-year performance period requires our three-year compound annualized total stockholder return TSR to exceed a threshold set at the three-year compound annualized TSR for the Morgan Stanley Capital International US REIT Index (the "Index") for the same period plus basis points. If the Outperformance Hurdle is met, a compensation pool will be formed equal to of the excess value created, subject to a maximum as defined by each performance period. POP awards cannot be paid at a time when we meet the outperformance hurdle yet our absolute TSR is negative. If after our absolute TSR has not been positive, the awards will be forfeited. The Outperformance Hurdle was met for the 2021 2023 performance period and the absolute maximum cap was earned and awarded in January 2024. The tables below include POP awards that were earned but are unvested, while any vested awards are reflected within the Consolidated Statements of Equity and Capital. The initial grant date fair value derived using a Monte Carlo valuation model was used in determining the grant date fair value per unit in the tables below. Commencing in 2024, the named executive officers ("NEOs") and certain select employees will receive performance stock units ("PSUs"), discussed below, and no new awards will be made to these individuals under the POP. We granted participation points for the 2024 2026 performance period in January 2024, with a fair value of million using a Monte Carlo valuation model that assumed a risk-free interest rate of and an expected volatility of for Prologis and for the Index.

Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) ("AOCI/L") The change in AOCI/L in the Consolidated Statements of Equity during the periods presented was due to the following: i) the currency translation adjustments ("CTA") that we recognize due to the translation of the financial statements of our consolidated subsidiaries, whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar, into U.S. dollars; and ii) the change in the fair value of the effective portion of our derivative financial instruments that have been designated as NIHs and CFHs and the translation of the hedged portion of our debt.

operating segments: Real Estate (Rental Operations and Development) and Strategic Capital. We generate revenues, earnings, net operating income and cash flows through our segments, as follows: Real Estate Segment. This operating segment represents the ownership and development of operating properties and is the largest component of our revenue and earnings. We collect rent from our customers through operating leases, including reimbursements for the majority of our property operating costs. Each operating property is considered to be an individual operating segment with similar economic characteristics; these properties are combined within the reportable business segment based on geographic location. The Real Estate Segment also includes development activities that lead to rental operations, including land held for development and properties currently under development, and other real estate investments, including energy assets. Within this line of business, we utilize the following: (i) our land bank; (ii) the development and leasing expertise of our local teams; and (iii) our customer relationships. 

 Strategic Capital Segment. This operating segment represents the management of unconsolidated co-investment ventures. We generate strategic capital revenues primarily from our unconsolidated co-investment ventures through asset management and property management services and we earn additional revenues by providing leasing, acquisition, construction, development, financing and disposition services. Depending on the structure of the venture and the returns provided to our partners, we also earn revenues through promotes periodically during the life of a venture or upon liquidation. Each unconsolidated co-investment venture we manage is considered to be an individual operating segment with similar economic characteristics; these ventures are combined within the reportable business segment based on geographic location. 

 Below we present: (i) each reportable business segment s revenues from external customers to Total Revenues ; (ii) each reportable business segment s net operating income from external customers to Operating Income and Earnings Before Income Taxes ; and (iii) each reportable business segment s assets to Total Assets . Our CODMs rely principally on net operating income and similar measures to make decisions about allocating resources and assessing segment performance. The applicable components of Total Revenues , Operating Income , Earnings Before Income Taxes and Total Assets in the Consolidated Financial Statements are allocated to each reportable business segment s revenues, net operating income and assets. Items that are not directly assignable to a segment are not allocated but reflected as non-segment items (G A expenses and real estate adjustments for depreciation and gains and losses on contributions and sales) due to how our CODMs utilize segment information for planning and execution of our business strategy.

 ITEM 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 
 The following should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes included in Item 1 of this report and our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, as filed with the United States U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission SEC ). 
 
 The statements in this report that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. These forward-looking statements are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about the industry and markets in which we operate as well as management s beliefs and assumptions. Such statements involve uncertainties that could significantly impact our financial results. Words such as expects, anticipates, intends, plans, believes, seeks, aims, and estimates including variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements, which generally are not historical in nature. All statements that address operating performance, events or developments that we expect or anticipate will occur in the future including statements relating to rent and occupancy growth, acquisition and development activity, contribution and disposition activity, general conditions in the geographic areas where we operate, expectations regarding new lines of business, our debt, capital structure and financial position, our ability to earn revenues from co-investment ventures or form new co-investment ventures and the availability of capital in existing or new co-investment ventures are forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. Although we believe the expectations reflected in any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, we can give no assurance that our expectations will be attained, and therefore actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or forecasted in such forward-looking statements. Some of the factors that may affect outcomes and results include, but are not limited to: (i) international, national, regional and local economic and political climates and conditions; (ii) changes in global financial markets, interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates; (iii) increased or unanticipated competition for our properties; (iv) risks associated with acquisitions, dispositions and development of properties, including the integration of the operations of significant real estate portfolios; (v) maintenance of Real Estate Investment Trust REIT status, tax structuring and changes in income tax laws and rates; (vi) availability of financing and capital, the levels of debt that we maintain and our credit ratings; (vii) risks related to our investments in and management of our co-investment ventures, including our ability to establish new co-investment ventures; (viii) risks of doing business internationally, including currency risks; (ix) environmental uncertainties, including risks of natural disasters; (x) risks related to global pandemics; and (xi) those additional factors discussed under Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. We undertake no duty to update any forward-looking statements appearing in this report except as may be required by law. 
 
 Prologis, Inc. is a self-administered and self-managed REIT and is the sole general partner of Prologis, L.P. through which it holds substantially all of its assets. We operate Prologis, Inc. and Prologis, L.P. as one enterprise and, therefore, our discussion and analysis refers to Prologis, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries, including Prologis, L.P. We invest in real estate through wholly owned subsidiaries and other entities through which we co-invest with partners and investors ("co-investment ventures"). We have a significant ownership interest in the co-investment ventures, which are either consolidated or unconsolidated based on our level of control of the entity. 
 
 We operate, manage and measure the operating performance of our properties on an owned and managed O M basis. Our O M portfolio includes our consolidated properties as well as properties owned by our unconsolidated co-investment ventures, which we manage. We make operating decisions based on our total O M portfolio as we manage the properties without regard to their ownership. We also evaluate our results based on our proportionate economic ownership of each property included in the O M portfolio our share ). 
 
 Included in our discussion below are references to funds from operations FFO and net operating income NOI ), neither of which are United States ("U.S.") generally accepted accounting principles GAAP ). See below for a reconciliation of Net Earnings Attributable to Common Stockholders/Unitholders in the Consolidated Statements of Income to our FFO measures and a reconciliation of NOI to Operating Income in the Consolidated Statements of Income , the most directly comparable GAAP measures. 
 
 MANAGEMENT'S OVERVIEW 
 
 Prologis is the global leader in logistics real estate with a focus on high-barrier, high growth markets. We own, manage and develop well-located, high-quality logistics facilities in 20 countries across four continents. Our portfolio focuses on the world s most vibrant centers of commerce and our scale across these locations allows us to better serve our customers diverse logistics requirements. 
 
 The importance of logistics supply chains has increased dramatically to our customers and the global economy. The long-term trends of e-commerce adoption and supply chain resiliency continue to drive the need for increased warehouse space to store and distribute goods. This demand has translated into meaningful increases in rents and low vacancy over the last several years. We believe this demand is driven by three primary factors: (i) customer supply chains re-positioning to address the significant shift to e-commerce and heightened service expectations; (ii) overall consumption and household growth; and (iii) our customers desire for more supply chain resiliency. We believe these forces will keep demand strong over the long term. In the short term, we expect some delay in our customers' leasing decisions over the next several quarters due to uncertainty in the economic and geopolitical environment.

Index 

 Our teams actively manage our portfolio by providing comprehensive real estate services, including leasing, property management, development, acquisitions and dispositions. We also invest significant capital into new logistics properties through our development activity and third-party acquisitions. Proceeds from the disposition of properties, generally through the contribution of newly developed properties to our co-investment ventures and the sales of non-strategic properties to third parties, allow us to recycle capital back into our investment activities. 
 
 While the majority of our properties in the U.S. are wholly owned, we hold a significant ownership interest in properties both in the U.S. and internationally through our investment in the co-investment ventures. Partnering with the world s largest institutional investors through co-investment ventures allows us to expand our investment capacity, enhance and diversify our real estate returns and mitigate our exposure to foreign currency movements. 
 
 Our scale and customer-focused strategy have compelled us to expand the services we provide. Our 1.2 billion square foot portfolio has provided the foundation upon which we have built a platform of solutions to address challenges that our customers face in global fulfillment today. Through Prologis Essentials, we focus on innovative ways to meet our customers operations and energy and sustainability needs. Our customer experience teams, proprietary technology and strategic partnerships are foundational to all aspects of our Prologis Essentials offerings. These resources allow us to provide our customers with unique and actionable insights and tools to help them make progress on sustainability goals and drive greater efficiency in their operations. 
 
 Finally, we believe our long-standing dedication to Environmental, Social and Governance ESG practices creates value for our customers, investors, employees and the communities in which we do business. The principles of ESG have been an important aspect of our business strategy that we believe delivers a strategic business advantage. 
 
 Our Global Presence 
 
 At September 30, 2024, we owned or had investments in, on a wholly-owned basis or through co-investment ventures, properties and development projects expected to total approximately 1.2 billion square feet across the following geographies: 

Throughout this discussion, we reflect amounts in the U.S. dollar, our reporting currency. Included in these amounts are consolidated and unconsolidated investments denominated in foreign currencies, principally the British pound sterling, Canadian dollar, euro and Japanese yen that are impacted by fluctuations in exchange rates when translated to U.S. dollars. We mitigate our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations by investing outside the U.S. through co-investment ventures, borrowing in the functional currency of our subsidiaries and utilizing derivative financial instruments.

Index 

 Our business comprises two operating segments: Real Estate (Rental Operations and Development) and Strategic Capital. 
 
 Below is information summarizing consolidated activity within our segments (in millions): 

(1) NOI from the Real Estate Segment is calculated directly from the Consolidated Financial Statements as Rental Revenues and Development Management and Other Revenues less Rental Expenses and Other Expenses. NOI from the Strategic Capital Segment is calculated directly from the Consolidated Financial Statements as Strategic Capital Revenues less Strategic Capital Expenses. 

(2) A developed property moves into the operating portfolio when it meets our definition of stabilization, which is the earlier of when a property that was developed has been completed for one year, is contributed to a co-investment venture following completion or is 90 occupied. Amounts represent our total expected investment ("TEI") upon stabilization, which includes the estimated cost of development or expansion, including land, construction and leasing costs. 

Real Estate Segment 
 
 Rental Operations. Rental operations comprise the largest component of our operating segments and generally contributes 90 to 95 of our consolidated revenues, earnings and FFO. We collect rent from our customers through operating leases, including reimbursements for the majority of our property operating costs. For leases that commenced during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, within the consolidated operating portfolio, the weighted average lease term was 63 months. We expect to generate earnings growth by increasing rents, maintaining high occupancy rates and controlling expenses. The primary driver of our revenue growth will be the rolling of in-place leases to current market rents when leases expire, as discussed further below. We believe our active portfolio management, combined with the skills of our property, leasing, maintenance, energy, sustainability and risk management teams allow us to maximize NOI across our portfolio. Substantially all of our consolidated rental revenue, NOI and cash flows from rental operations are generated in the U.S. 
 
 Development. Given the scarcity of modern logistics facilities in our target markets, our development business provides the opportunity to build to the evolving requirements of our customers while deepening our market presence. We believe we have a competitive advantage due to (i) the strategic locations of our global land bank and redevelopment sites; (ii) the development expertise of our local teams; (iii) the depth of our customer relationships; (iv) our ability to integrate sustainable design features that provide operational efficiencies for our customers; and (v) our procurement capabilities that allow us to secure high-demand construction materials at a lower cost. Successful development and redevelopment efforts provide significant earnings growth as projects are leased, generate income and increase the value of our Real Estate Segment. Generally, we develop properties in the U.S. to hold for the long-term and outside the U.S. for contribution to our unconsolidated co-investment ventures. 
 
 Strategic Capital Segment 
 
 Through the Strategic Capital Segment, we partner with many of the world s largest institutional investors through unconsolidated co-investment ventures. The business is capitalized through private and public equity, of which 94 is in open ended ventures, long-term ventures or two publicly traded vehicles (Nippon Prologis REIT, Inc. in Japan and FIBRA Prologis in Mexico). We align our interests with our partners by holding significant ownership interests in our nine unconsolidated co-investment ventures (ranging from 15 to 50 ). This structure allows us to reduce our exposure to foreign currency movements for investments outside the U.S. 
 
 This segment produces durable, long-term cash flows and generally contributes 5 to 10 of our consolidated revenues, earnings and FFO, excluding promotes. We generate strategic capital revenue from our unconsolidated co-investment ventures, principally through asset management and property management services. Revenue earned from asset management fees is primarily driven by the quarterly valuation of the real estate properties owned by the respective ventures. We earn additional revenues by providing leasing, acquisition, construction management, development and disposition services. In certain ventures, we also have the ability to earn revenues through incentive fees promotes or promote revenues periodically during the life of a venture, upon liquidation of a venture or upon stabilization of individual venture assets based primarily on the total return of the investments over certain financial hurdles. Promote revenues are recognized when earned at the end of the promote period for the specific co-investment ventures. We plan to grow this business and increase revenues by increasing our assets under management in existing or new ventures. The majority of the strategic capital revenues are generated outside the U.S.

Index 

FUTURE GROWTH 
 
 We believe that the quality and scale of our portfolio, our ability to build out our land bank and redevelopment sites, our strategic capital business, the depth of our customer relationships and the strength of our balance sheet are differentiators that allow us to drive growth in revenues, NOI, earnings, FFO and cash flows. 

(1) Net effective rent ("NER") is calculated at the beginning of the lease using estimated total cash base rent to be received over the term and annualized and excludes fair value lease amortization from acquisitions. Amounts derived in a currency other than the U.S. dollar have been translated using the average rate from the previous twelve months. Trailing NER change is based on the twelve months immediately prior to the period ended. 

Rent change represents the percentage change in net effective rental rates (average rate over the lease term), on new and renewed leases, commenced during the period compared with previous net effective rental rates in that same space. 
 
 Rent Growth . As a result of several years of increases in market rents, our in-place leases have considerable upside potential to capture these higher rents and to drive future organic NOI growth. This is evident in the positive rent change we have experienced in every quarter since 2013 and was significant to our operating results over the last several years. We estimate that our share of the lease mark-to-market is approximately 34 (on an NER basis), which represents the growth rate from in-place rents to current market rents based on our share of the O M portfolio at September 30, 2024. Therefore, even without further market rent growth, we expect our lease renewals to result in higher future rental income. 

Value Creation from Development. The global nature of our development program provides a wide landscape of opportunities to pursue based on our judgment of market conditions, opportunities and risks. One of the ways in which we create value is through our focus on sourcing well-located land and redevelopment sites through acquisition opportunities. This strategy has allowed us to create opportunities for the conversion of income-producing assets, acquired with the intention for redevelopment, into industrial properties (Covered Land Plays or "CLPs") and data centers. 

Based on our current estimates, our consolidated land and other real estate investments, including options and CLPs, have the potential to support the development of 36.0 billion 40.7 billion on an O M basis) of TEI of newly developed buildings. We measure the estimated value creation of a development project as the stabilized value above our TEI. As properties are completed and leased, we expect to realize the value creation principally through gains realized through contributions of these properties to unconsolidated co-investment ventures and increases in the NOI of the consolidated portfolio. 
 
 Strategic Capital Advantages. The co-investment ventures provide capital from third parties that allows us to grow our O M portfolio, contribute to self-funding our development activities through the sale of newly developed assets to these vehicles and produce substantial fees for our management of the assets. We raise capital to support the long-term growth of the co-investment ventures while maintaining our own substantial investments in these vehicles. At September 30, 2024, the gross book value of the operating portfolio held by our nine unconsolidated co-investment ventures was 55.7 billion across 519 million square feet. 

Balance Sheet Strength. We have a long-held strategy to build and maintain a balance sheet that is strong and flexible by using conservative levels of financial leverage. At September 30, 2024, the weighted average remaining maturity of our consolidated debt was 10 years and the weighted average interest rate was 3.1 . Through our refinancing activities we have substantially addressed our debt maturities until 2026. At September 30, 2024, we had total available liquidity of 6.6 billion. We continue to maintain low leverage as a percentage of our real estate investments and our market capitalization. As a result of our low leverage, available liquidity and investment capacity in the co-investment ventures, we have significant ability to capitalize on opportunistic value-added investments as they arise. 

Our Scale Drives Efficiency. We have scalable systems and infrastructure in place to grow both our consolidated and O M portfolios with limited incremental G A expense. We believe we can continue to grow NOI and strategic capital revenues organically and through accretive development and acquisition activity while further reducing G A as a percentage of our investments in real estate.

Index 

Staying Ahead of What s Next . We are focused on creating value beyond real estate by enhancing our customers experience, leveraging our scale in procurement and innovating through data analytics and digitization efforts. This includes investments in early and growth-stage companies that are focused on emerging technologies for the logistics sector. Through Prologis Essentials, we support our customers through service and product offerings, including innovative solutions to operations and energy and sustainability needs that can make our customers' decision process easier while helping them advance their environmental goals. 

SUMMARY OF THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2024 
 
 Our operating results were strong during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 despite the softening of rents and occupancy in the market. Due to increases in market rents over the last several years, our existing lease mark-to-market drove rent change on rollover and same-store growth in our O M portfolio. Our operating portfolio occupancy was 96.2 at September 30, 2024 and rent change on leases that commenced during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 69.5 on a net effective basis, both metrics based on our ownership share. 
 
 While our proprietary metrics around lease proposals are positive, we expect our customers to exercise caution in their leasing decisions through the remainder of 2024 due to uncertainty in the economic and geopolitical environment. Additionally, we are experiencing slower decision-making with build-to-suits and, as a result, expect limited speculative development in the short term. Despite the current environment, we believe we are well positioned to organically grow revenues over the long-term given the cumulative growth in market rents over the last several years and our existing high lease mark-to-market. 
 
 We completed the following significant activities in 2024, as described in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements: 
 
 We generated net proceeds of 2.4 billion and realized net gains of 811 million, principally from the contribution of properties to unconsolidated co-investment ventures in the U.S. and Europe, and sales of non-strategic properties to third parties in the U.S. 

Through our investment in consolidated joint ventures in India, we acquired 225 acres of land to support future development opportunities in this new market. 

At September 30, 2024, we had total available liquidity of 6.6 billion, including borrowing capacity on our credit facilities of 5.8 billion and unrestricted cash balances of 781 million. 

In March 2024, we established a commercial paper program, under which we may issue, repay and re-issue short-term unsecured commercial paper notes CPNs denominated in U.S. dollars. At any point in time, we are required to maintain available commitments under our credit facilities in an amount at least equal to the CPNs outstanding. 

We issued 4.2 billion of senior notes with an issuance date weighted average interest rate of 4.8 and weighted average maturity of 14 years (principal in millions):

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2024 AND 2023 
 
 We evaluate our business operations based on the NOI of our two operating segments: Real Estate (Rental Operations and Development) and Strategic Capital. NOI by segment is a non-GAAP performance measure that is calculated using revenues and expenses directly from our financial statements. We consider NOI by segment to be an appropriate supplemental measure of our performance because it helps management and investors understand our operating results.

 Real Estate Segment 
 
 This operating segment principally includes rental revenue and rental expenses recognized from our consolidated properties. This segment also includes the operating results of our energy assets. We allocate the costs of our property management and leasing functions to the Real Estate Segment through Rental Expenses and the Strategic Capital Segment through Strategic Capital Expenses, both in the Consolidated Financial Statements , based on the square footage of the relative portfolios. In addition, this segment is impacted by our development, acquisition and disposition activities.

Index 

The 401 million change in Real Estate Segment RES NOI for the nine months ended September 30 compared to the same period in 2023, was impacted by the following activities (in millions): 

(1) During both periods, we experienced positive rental rate growth due to increases in market rents over the last several years. Rental rate growth is a combination of higher rental rates on rollover of leases (or rent change) and contractual rent increases on existing leases. If a lease has a contractual rent increase driven by a metric that is not known at the time the lease commences, such as the consumer price index or a similar metric, the rent increase is not included in rent leveling and therefore impacts the rental revenue we recognize. Significant rent change during both periods continues to be a key driver in increasing rental income. See below for key metrics on rent change on rollover and occupancy. 

(2) The increase due to acquisitions is principally due to the additional NOI in 2024 from the 3.1 billion real estate portfolio acquired in the U.S. on June 29, 2023. Acquisition activity also includes the fair value lease amortization to rental revenues due to in-place leases that were primarily below market at the time of the acquisition. 

(3) We calculate changes in NOI from development completions period over period by comparing the change in NOI generated on the pool of developments that completed on or after January 1, 2023 through September 30, 2024. 

Below are key operating metrics of our consolidated operating portfolio. 

(1) Consolidated square feet of leases commenced and weighted average net effective rent change were calculated for leases with initial terms of one year or greater. 

(2) Calculated using the trailing twelve months immediately prior to the period ended.

(2) Estimated weighted average margin is calculated on development properties as estimated value creation, less estimated closing costs and taxes, if any, on properties expected to be sold or contributed, divided by TEI. Development margins fluctuate depending on several factors including cost of capital, changes in capitalization rates that are used to estimate value at completion and location and type of development, such as build-to-suit development. 

At September 30, 2024, the consolidated development portfolio, including properties under development and pre-stabilized properties, was expected to be completed before August 2026 with a TEI of 5.4 billion and was 32.8 leased. This includes the development of data centers with an aggregate TEI of 1.1 billion, on a consolidated basis. Our investment in the development portfolio was 3.1 billion at September 30, 2024. 
 
 Capital Expenditures 
 
 We capitalize costs incurred in improving and leasing our operating properties as part of the investment basis or within Other Assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The following graph summarizes recurring capitalized expenditures and leasing costs of our consolidated operating properties during each quarter and excludes development costs and spend subsequent to stabilization that is structural in nature and non-recurring: 

Strategic Capital Segment 
 
 This operating segment includes revenues from asset management and property management services, transactional services for acquisition, disposition and leasing activity and promote revenue earned from the unconsolidated co-investment ventures. Revenues associated with the Strategic Capital Segment fluctuate because of changes in the size of the portfolios through acquisitions and dispositions, the fair value of the properties, timing of promotes, foreign currency exchange rates and other transactional activity. These revenues are reduced by the direct costs associated with the asset and property-level management expenses for the properties owned by these ventures. We allocate the costs of our property management and leasing functions to the Strategic Capital Segment through Strategic Capital Expenses and to the Real Estate Segment through Rental Expenses, both in the Consolidated Financial Statements,

(1) The U.S. expenses include compensation and personnel costs for employees who are based in the U.S. but also support other geographies. 

(2) Recurring fees include asset management and property management fees. 

(3) Transactional fees include leasing commissions and acquisition, disposition, development and other fees. 

(4) We generally earn promote revenue directly from third-party investors in the co-investment ventures based on the cumulative returns of the venture over a three-year period or the stabilization of individual development projects owned by the venture. The promote revenue we earned during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, was primarily from Prologis Targeted U.S. Logistics Fund in the second quarter of 2023. Changes in asset valuations within the co-investment ventures during the promote period is one of the significant inputs to the calculation of promote revenues. The asset valuations are prepared by third-party valuation firms. 

For promotes earned after January 2024, we amended the Prologis Promote Plan ("PPP") to award up to 25 of the third-party portion of the promotes earned by us from the co-investment ventures to our employees. This award is issued as a combination of cash and equity-based awards, pursuant to the terms of the PPP and expensed through Strategic Capital Expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income, as vested. For promotes earned prior to January 2024, up to 40 of the third-party portion of promotes earned was awarded to certain employees. 
 
 G A Expenses 
 
 G A expenses were 316 million and 292 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. G A expenses increased in 2024 as compared to 2023, principally due to inflationary increases and higher compensation expenses. We capitalize certain internal costs that are incremental and directly related to our development and building improvement activities.

Depreciation and Amortization Expenses 
 
 Depreciation and amortization expenses were 1.9 billion and 1.8 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 
 The 78 million change in depreciation and amortization expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023, was impacted by the following items (in millions): 

Gains on Real Estate Transactions, Net 
 
 Gains on the disposition of development properties and land were 160 million and 274 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, primarily from the contribution of properties we developed to unconsolidated co-investment ventures in the U.S. and Europe in 2024 and in Japan in 2023. Gains on other dispositions of investments in real estate were 651 million and 158 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The gains recognized in 2024 are primarily from the contribution of operating properties to our U.S. unconsolidated co-investment venture, and both 2024 and 2023 include the sale of non-strategic properties in the U.S. 
 
 Historically, we have utilized the proceeds from these transactions primarily to fund our acquisition and development activities. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on these transactions. 
 
 Our Owned and Managed O M Operating Portfolio 
 
 We manage our business and review our operating fundamentals on an O M basis, which includes our consolidated properties and properties owned by our unconsolidated co-investment ventures. We believe reviewing the results in this way allows management to understand performance more broadly as we manage the properties without regard to their ownership. We do not control the unconsolidated co-investment ventures for purposes of GAAP and the presentation of the ventures operating information does not represent a legal claim. 
 
 Our O M operating portfolio does not include our development portfolio, value-added properties, non-industrial properties or properties that we consider non-strategic and do not have the intent to hold long term that are classified as either held for sale or within other real estate investments. Value-added properties are properties we have either acquired at a discount and believe we could provide greater returns post-stabilization or properties we expect to repurpose to a higher and better use.

 Below are the key leasing metrics of our O M operating portfolio. 

(1) Square feet of leases commenced and weighted average net effective rent change were calculated for leases with initial terms of one year or greater. We retained approximately 70 or more of our customers, based on the total square feet of leases commenced during these periods. 

(2) Calculated using the trailing twelve months immediately prior to the period ended. 

(3) Turnover costs include external leasing commissions and tenant improvements and represent the obligations incurred in connection with the lease commencement for leases greater than one year. 

Same Store Analysis 
 
 Our same store metrics are non-GAAP financial measures, which are commonly used in the real estate industry and expected from the financial community, presented on both a net effective and cash basis. We evaluate the performance of the operating properties we own and manage using a same store analysis to ensure that the population of properties in this analysis is consistent from period to period, allowing us and investors to analyze our ongoing business operations. We determine our same store metrics on property NOI, which is calculated as rental revenue less rental expense for the applicable properties in the same store population for both consolidated and unconsolidated properties based on our ownership interest, as further defined below. 
 
 We define our same store population for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as the properties in our O M operating portfolio, including the property NOI for both consolidated properties and properties owned by the unconsolidated co-investment ventures, at January 1, 2023 and owned throughout the same three-month period in both 2023 and 2024. We believe the drivers of property NOI for the consolidated portfolio are generally the same for the properties owned by the ventures in which we invest and therefore we evaluate the same store metrics of the O M portfolio based on Prologis ownership in the properties Prologis Share ). The same store population excludes properties held for sale to third parties, along with development properties that were not stabilized at the beginning of the period (January 1, 2023) and properties acquired or disposed of to third parties during the period. To derive an appropriate measure of period-to-period operating performance, we remove the effects of foreign currency exchange rate movements by using the reported period-end exchange rate to translate from local currency into the U.S. dollar, for both periods.

 As non-GAAP financial measures, the same store metrics have certain limitations as analytical tools and may vary among real estate companies. As a result, we provide a reconciliation of Rental Revenues less Rental Expenses Property NOI (from our Consolidated Financial Statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP) to our Same Store Property NOI measures, as follows for the three months ended September 30 (dollars in millions):

(1) We exclude properties held for sale to third parties, along with development properties that were not stabilized at the beginning of the period and properties acquired or disposed of to third parties during the period. We also exclude net termination and renegotiation fees and write-offs of fair value lease assets or liabilities to allow us to evaluate the growth or decline in each property s rental revenues without regard to one-time items that are not indicative of the property s recurring operating performance. Net termination and renegotiation fees represent the gross fee negotiated to allow a customer to terminate or renegotiate their lease, offset by the write-off of the asset recorded due to the adjustment to straight-line rents over the lease term. Same Store Property NOI is adjusted to include an allocation of property management expenses for our consolidated properties based on the property management services provided to each property (generally, based on a percentage of revenues). On consolidation, these amounts are eliminated and the actual costs of providing property management and leasing services are recognized as part of our consolidated rental expense. 

(2) We include the Property NOI for the same store portfolio for both consolidated properties and properties owned by the co-investment ventures based on our investment in the underlying properties. In order to calculate our share of Same Store Property NOI from the co-investment ventures in which we own less than 100 , we use the co-investment ventures underlying Property NOI for the same store portfolio and apply our ownership percentage at September 30, 2024 to the Property NOI for both periods, including the properties contributed during the period. We adjust the total Property NOI from the same store portfolio of the co-investment ventures by subtracting the third parties share of both consolidated and unconsolidated co-investment ventures. 

During the periods presented, certain wholly owned properties were contributed to a co-investment venture and are included in the same store portfolio. Neither our consolidated results nor those of the co-investment ventures, when viewed individually, would be comparable on a same store basis because of the changes in composition of the respective portfolios from period to period (e.g. the results of a contributed property are included in our consolidated results through the contribution date and in the results of the venture subsequent to the contribution date based on our ownership interest at the end of the period). As a result, only line items labeled Prologis Share of Same Store Property NOI are comparable period over period. 
 
 (3) We further remove certain noncash items (straight-line rent and fair value lease amortization) included in the financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP to reflect a Same Store Property NOI Cash measure. 

We manage our business and compensate our executives based on the same store results of our O M portfolio at 100 as we manage our portfolio on an ownership blind basis. We calculate those results by including 100 of the properties included in our same store portfolio.

 Other Components of Income (Expense) 
 
 Earnings from Unconsolidated Entities, Net 
 
 We recognized net earnings from unconsolidated entities, which are generally accounted for using the equity method, of 260 million and 218 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 
 The earnings we recognize can be impacted by: (i) the size, rental rates and occupancy of the portfolio of properties owned by each venture; (ii) interest expense based on the size of the debt portfolio; (iii) gains or losses from the dispositions of properties and extinguishment of debt; (iv) our ownership interest in each venture; (v) other variances in revenues and expenses of each venture; and (vi) fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates used to translate our share of net earnings to U.S. dollars. 
 
 See the discussion of our unconsolidated entities above in the Strategic Capital Segment discussion and in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a further breakdown of our share of net earnings recognized.

Interest expense increased during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023, principally due to the issuance of senior notes to finance our acquisition and development activities and higher interest rates on new issuances. We issued 4.2 billion of senior notes during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 5.4 billion during the year ended December 31, 2023, with a weighted average interest rate of 4.8 and 4.7 , respectively, at the issuance date. 
 
 See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Liquidity and Capital Resources section below, for further discussion of our debt and borrowing costs. 
 
 Foreign Currency, Derivative and Other Gains (Losses) and Other Income (Expense), Net 
 
 We recognized foreign currency, derivative and other gains (losses) and other income (expense), net, of 63 million and 103 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Included in these amounts was interest income earned on short-term investments. 
 
 We are exposed to foreign currency exchange risk related to investments in and earnings from our foreign investments. We primarily hedge our foreign currency risk related to our investments by borrowing in the currencies in which we invest thereby providing a natural hedge. We have issued debt in a currency that is not the same functional currency of the borrowing entity and have designated a portion of the debt as a nonderivative net investment hedge. We recognize the remeasurement and settlement of the translation adjustment on the unhedged portion of the debt and accrued interest in unrealized gains or losses. We may use derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our earnings. We recognize the change in fair value of the undesignated derivative contracts in unrealized gains and losses. Upon settlement of these transactions, we recognize realized gains or losses.

 Income Tax Expense 
 
 We recognize income tax expense related to our taxable REIT subsidiaries and in the local, state and foreign jurisdictions in which we operate. Our current income tax expense (benefit) fluctuates from period to period based primarily on the timing of our taxable income, including gains on the disposition of properties, fees earned from the co-investment ventures and taxable earnings from unconsolidated co-investment ventures. Deferred income tax expense (benefit) is generally a function of the period s temporary differences and the utilization of net operating losses generated in prior years that had been previously recognized as deferred income tax assets in taxable subsidiaries.

Net Earnings Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests 
 
 Net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests represents the third-party investors share of the earnings generated in consolidated entities in which we do not own 100 of the equity, reduced by the third-party share of fees or promotes payable to us and earned during the period. We had net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests of 153 million and 149 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Included in these amounts were 61 million for both the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, of net earnings attributable to the common limited partnership unitholders of Prologis, L.P. 
 
 See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on our noncontrolling interests. 
 
 Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) 
 
 The key driver of changes in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) AOCI/L in the Consolidated Financial Statements during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, was the currency translation adjustment derived from changes in exchange rates during both periods principally on our net investments in real estate outside the U.S. and the borrowings we issue in the functional currencies of the countries where we invest. These borrowings serve as a natural hedge of our foreign investments. In addition, we use derivative financial instruments, such as foreign currency contracts to manage foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign investments and interest rate contracts to manage interest rate risk, that when designated the change in fair value is included in AOCI/L. 
 
 See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on changes in other comprehensive income and about our derivative and nonderivative transactions. 
 
 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2024 AND 2023 
 
 Except as separately discussed above, the changes in comprehensive income attributable to common stockholders and unitholders and its components for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, are similar to the changes for the nine-month periods ended on the same dates. 
 
 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 
 Overview 
 
 We consider our ability to generate cash from operating activities, distributions from our co-investment ventures, contributions and dispositions of properties and available financing sources to be adequate to meet our anticipated future development, acquisition, operating, debt service, dividend and distribution requirements.

 In addition to dividends and distributions, we expect our primary cash needs will consist of the following: 
 
 completion of the development and leasing of the properties in our consolidated development portfolio (at September 30, 2024, 97 properties in our development portfolio were 32.8 leased with a current investment of 3.1 billion and a TEI of 5.4 billion when completed and leased, leaving 2.3 billion of estimated additional required investment); 

development of new properties that we may hold for long-term investment or subsequently contribute to unconsolidated co-investment ventures, including the acquisition of land; 

the acquisition of other real estate investments that we acquire with the intention of redeveloping into industrial properties and data centers; 

capital expenditures and leasing costs on properties in our operating portfolio; 

investments in renewable energy, energy storage and mobility infrastructure to serve our customers; 

repayment of debt and scheduled principal payments of 2 million in the remainder of 2024 and 540 million in 2025; 

additional investments in current and future co-investment ventures and other ventures; and 

the acquisition of operating properties or portfolios of operating properties (depending on market and other conditions), for direct, long-term investment in our consolidated portfolio (this might include acquisitions from our unconsolidated entities). 

We expect to fund our cash needs principally from the following sources (subject to market conditions): 
 
 net cash flow from property operations; 

fees earned for services performed on behalf of co-investment ventures; 

distributions received from co-investment ventures; 

proceeds from the contribution of properties to current or future co-investment ventures; 

proceeds from the disposition of properties or other investments to third parties; 

available unrestricted cash balances 781 million at September 30, 2024); 

borrowing capacity under our current credit facility arrangements that allows us to borrow on a short-term basis, with maturities generally ranging from overnight to three months 5.8 billion available at September 30, 2024), including our commercial paper program that we established in the first quarter of 2024; and 

proceeds from the issuance of debt. 

In the long term, we may also voluntarily repurchase our outstanding debt or equity securities (depending on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity, contractual restrictions and other factors) through cash purchases, open-market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, tender offers or otherwise. We may also fund our cash needs from the issuance of equity securities, subject to market conditions, and through the sale of a portion of our investments in co-investment ventures.

(1) The weighted average remaining maturity for total debt outstanding at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was 10 and 9 years, respectively. 

Our credit ratings at September 30, 2024, were A from Standard Poor's with a stable outlook and A3 from Moody s with a positive outlook. These ratings allow us to borrow at an advantageous interest rate. Adverse changes in our credit ratings could negatively impact our business and, in particular, our refinancing and other capital market activities, our ability to manage debt maturities, our future growth and our development and acquisition activity. A securities rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and is subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the rating organization. 
 
 At September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with all of our financial debt covenants. These covenants include a number of customary financial covenants, such as maintaining debt service coverage ratios, leverage ratios and fixed charge coverage ratios. 
 
 See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on our debt.

Operating Activities 
 
 Cash provided by and used in operating activities, exclusive of changes in receivables and payables, was impacted by the following significant activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: 
 
 Real Estate Segment. We receive the majority of our operating cash through the net revenues of our Real Estate Segment, including the recovery of our operating costs. Cash flows generated by the Real Estate Segment are impacted by our acquisition, development and disposition activities, which are drivers of NOI recognized during each period. See the Results of Operations section above for further explanation of our Real Estate Segment. The revenues from this segment include noncash adjustments for straight-lined rents and amortization of above and below market leases of 470 million and 467 million in 2024 and 2023, respectively. 

Strategic Capital Segment. We also generate operating cash through our Strategic Capital Segment by providing asset management and property management and other services to our unconsolidated co-investment ventures. See the Results of Operations section above for the key drivers of the net revenues from our Strategic Capital Segment. Included in Strategic Capital Revenues in the Consolidated Statements of Income are the promotes we earn from the third-party investors in our co-investment ventures, which are recognized in operating activities in the period the cash is received, generally the quarter after the revenue is recognized. 

G A expenses and equity-based compensation awards. We incurred 316 million and 292 million of G A expenses in 2024 and 2023, respectively. We recognized equity-based, noncash compensation expenses of 164 million and 210 million in 2024 and 2023, respectively, which were recorded to Rental Expenses in the Real Estate Segment, Strategic Capital Expenses in the Strategic Capital Segment and G A Expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income. 

Operating distributions from unconsolidated entities. We received 417 million and 536 million of distributions as a return on our investment from the cash flows generated from the operations of our unconsolidated entities in 2024 and 2023, respectively. 

Cash paid for interest, net of amounts capitalized. We paid interest, net of amounts capitalized, of 573 million and 340 million in 2024 and 2023, respectively. 

Cash paid for income taxes, net of refunds. We paid income taxes, net of refunds, of 105 million and 122 million in 2024 and 2023, respectively. 

Investing Activities 
 
 Cash provided by investing activities is driven by proceeds from the sale of real estate assets that include the contribution of properties we developed to our unconsolidated co-investment ventures as well as the sale of non-strategic operating properties. Cash used in investing activities is principally driven by our capital deployment activities of investing in real estate development, acquisitions and capital expenditures as discussed above. This activity includes land for future development, operating properties, other real estate assets and real estate portfolios, such as the 3.1 billion portfolio acquired in the second quarter of 2023. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on these activities. In addition, the following significant transactions also impacted our cash used in and provided by investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: 
 
 Investments in and advances to our unconsolidated entities. We invested cash in our unconsolidated entities of 480 million and 246 million in 2024 and 2023, respectively, representing our proportionate share. The ventures used the funds for the acquisition of properties, development and repayment of debt. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more detail on our unconsolidated co-investment ventures. 

Return of investment from unconsolidated entities. We received distributions from unconsolidated entities as a return of investment of 54 million and 305 million in 2024 and 2023, respectively. Included in these amounts were distributions from venture activities including proceeds from property sales, debt refinancing and the redemption of our investment in certain unconsolidated entities. 

Net proceeds from (payments on) the settlement of net investment hedges. We received net proceeds of 11 million and 31 million for the settlement of net investment hedges in 2024 and 2023, respectively. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on our derivative transactions. 

Financing Activities 
 
 Cash provided by and used in financing activities is principally driven by proceeds from and payments on credit facilities, commercial paper and other debt, along with dividends paid on common and preferred stock and noncontrolling interest contributions and distributions. Our credit facilities and our commercial paper support our cash needs for development and acquisition activities on a

Unconsolidated Co-Investment Venture Debt 
 
 We had investments in and advances to our unconsolidated co-investment ventures of 9.3 billion at September 30, 2024. These ventures had total third-party debt of 16.6 billion at September 30, 2024 with a weighted average remaining maturity of 6 years and weighted average interest rate of 3.3 . The weighted average loan-to-value ratio for all unconsolidated co-investment ventures was 29.1 at September 30, 2024 based on gross book value. Loan-to-value, a non-GAAP measure, was calculated as the percentage of total third-party debt to the gross book value of real estate for each venture and weighted based on the cumulative gross book value of all unconsolidated co-investment ventures. 
 
 At September 30, 2024, we did not guarantee any third-party debt of the unconsolidated co-investment ventures. 
 
 Dividend and Distribution Requirements 
 
 Our dividend policy on our common stock is to distribute a percentage of our cash flow to ensure that we will meet the dividend requirements of the Internal Revenue Code ("IRC"), relative to maintaining our REIT status, while still allowing us to retain cash to fund our capital deployment and other investment activities. 
 
 Under the IRC, REITs may be subject to certain federal income and excise taxes on undistributed taxable income. 
 
 We paid quarterly cash dividends of 0.96 and 0.87 per common share in each of the first three quarters of 2024 and 2023, respectively. Our future common stock dividends, if and as declared, may vary and will be determined by the Board based upon the circumstances prevailing at the time, including our financial condition, operating results and REIT distribution requirements, and may be adjusted at the discretion of the Board during the year. 
 
 We make distributions on the common limited partnership units outstanding at the same per unit amount as our common stock dividend. The Class A common limited partnerships units ("Class A Units") in the OP are entitled to a quarterly distribution equal to 0.64665 per unit so long as the common units receive a quarterly distribution of at least 0.40 per unit. We paid a quarterly cash distribution of 0.64665 per Class A Unit in the first three quarters of 2024 and 2023. 
 
 At September 30, 2024, our Series Q preferred stock had an annual dividend rate of 8.54 per share and the dividends are payable quarterly in arrears. 
 
 Pursuant to the terms of our preferred stock, we are restricted from declaring or paying any dividend with respect to our common stock unless and until all cumulative dividends with respect to the preferred stock have been paid and sufficient funds have been set aside for dividends that have been declared for the relevant dividend period with respect to the preferred stock. 
 
 Other Commitments 
 
 On an ongoing basis, we are engaged in various stages of negotiations for the acquisition or disposition of individual properties or portfolios of properties.

 FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS ATTRIBUTABLE TO COMMON STOCKHOLDERS/UNITHOLDERS FFO 
 
 FFO is a non-GAAP financial measure that is commonly used in the real estate industry. The most directly comparable GAAP measure to FFO is net earnings. 
 
 The National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts NAREIT defines FFO as earnings computed under GAAP to exclude historical cost depreciation and gains and losses from the sales net of any related tax, along with impairment charges, of previously depreciated properties. We also exclude the gains on revaluation of equity investments upon acquisition of a controlling interest and the gain recognized from a partial sale of our investment, as these are similar to gains from the sales of previously depreciated properties. We exclude similar adjustments from our unconsolidated entities and the third parties share of our consolidated ventures. 
 
 Our FFO Measures 
 
 Our FFO measures begin with NAREIT s definition and we make certain adjustments to reflect our business and the way that management plans and executes our business strategy. While not infrequent or unusual, the additional items we adjust for in calculating FFO, as modified by Prologis and Core FFO , both as defined below, are subject to significant fluctuations from period to period. Although these items may have a material impact on our operations and are reflected in our financial statements, the removal of the effects of these items allows us to better understand the core operating performance of our properties over the long term. These items have both positive and negative short-term effects on our results of operations in inconsistent and unpredictable directions that are not relevant to our long-term outlook. 
 
 We calculate our FFO measures, as defined below, based on our proportionate ownership share of both our unconsolidated entities and consolidated ventures. We reflect our share of our FFO measures for unconsolidated entities by applying our average ownership percentage for the period to the applicable adjusting items on an entity-by-entity basis. We reflect our share for consolidated ventures in which we do not own 100 of the equity by adjusting our FFO measures to remove the noncontrolling interests share of the applicable adjusting items based on our average ownership percentage for the applicable periods. 
 
 These FFO measures are used by management as supplemental financial measures of operating performance and we believe that it is important that stockholders, potential investors and financial analysts understand the measures management uses. We do not use our FFO measures as, nor should they be considered to be, alternatives to net earnings computed under GAAP, as indicators of our operating performance, as alternatives to cash from operating activities computed under GAAP or as indicators of our ability to fund our cash needs. 
 
 We analyze our operating performance principally by the rental revenue of our real estate and the revenues from our strategic capital business, net of operating, administrative and financing expenses. This income stream is not directly impacted by fluctuations in the market value of our investments in real estate or debt securities. 
 
 FFO, as modified by Prologis attributable to common stockholders/unitholders FFO, as modified by Prologis 
 
 To arrive at FFO, as modified by Prologis , we adjust the NAREIT defined FFO measure to exclude the impact of foreign currency related items and deferred tax, specifically: 
 
 deferred income tax benefits and deferred income tax expenses recognized by our subsidiaries; 

current income tax expense related to acquired tax liabilities that were recorded as deferred tax liabilities in an acquisition, to the extent the expense is offset with a deferred income tax benefit in earnings that is excluded from our defined FFO measure; and 

foreign currency exchange gains and losses resulting from (i) debt transactions between us and our foreign entities; (ii) third-party debt that is used to hedge our investment in foreign entities; (iii) derivative financial instruments related to any such debt transactions; and (iv) mark-to-market adjustments associated with derivative and other financial instruments. 

We use FFO, as modified by Prologis , so that management, analysts and investors are able to evaluate our performance against other REITs that do not have similar operations or operations in jurisdictions outside the U.S. 
 
 Core FFO attributable to common stockholders/unitholders Core FFO 
 
 In addition to FFO, as modified by Prologis , we also use Core FFO. To arrive at Core FFO, we adjust FFO, as modified by Prologis , to exclude the following recurring and nonrecurring items that we recognize directly in FFO, as modified by Prologis : 
 
 gains or losses from the disposition of land and development properties that were developed with the intent to contribute or sell; 

income tax expense related to the sale of investments in real estate; 

48 

Index 

 impairment charges recognized related to our investments in real estate generally as a result of our change in intent to contribute or sell these properties; and 

gains or losses from the early extinguishment of debt and redemption and repurchase of preferred stock. 

We use Core FFO , including by segment and region, to: (i) assess our operating performance as compared to other real estate companies; (ii) evaluate our performance and the performance of our properties in comparison with expected results and results of previous periods; (iii) evaluate the performance of our management; (iv) budget and forecast future results to assist in the allocation of resources; (v) provide guidance to the financial markets to understand our expected operating performance; and (vi) evaluate how a specific potential investment will impact our future results. 
 
 Limitations on the use of our FFO measures 
 
 While we believe our modified FFO measures are important supplemental measures, neither NAREIT s nor our measures of FFO should be used alone because they exclude significant economic components of net earnings computed under GAAP and are, therefore, limited as an analytical tool. Accordingly, these are only a few of the many measures we use when analyzing our business. Some of the limitations are: 
 
 The current income tax expenses that are excluded from our modified FFO measures represent the taxes that are payable. 

Depreciation and amortization of real estate assets are economic costs that are excluded from FFO. FFO is limited, as it does not reflect the cash requirements that may be necessary for future replacements of the real estate assets. Furthermore, the amortization of capital expenditures and leasing costs necessary to maintain the operating performance of logistics facilities are not reflected in FFO. 

Gains or losses from property dispositions and impairment charges related to expected dispositions represent changes in value of the properties. By excluding these gains and losses, FFO does not capture realized changes in the value of disposed properties arising from changes in market conditions. 

The deferred income tax benefits and expenses that are excluded from our modified FFO measures result from the creation of a deferred income tax asset or liability that may have to be settled at some future point. Our modified FFO measures do not currently reflect any income or expense that may result from such settlement. 

The foreign currency exchange gains and losses that are excluded from our modified FFO measures are generally recognized based on movements in foreign currency exchange rates through a specific point in time. The ultimate settlement of our foreign currency-denominated net assets is indefinite as to timing and amount. Our FFO measures are limited in that they do not reflect the current period changes in these net assets that result from periodic foreign currency exchange rate movements. 

The gains and losses on extinguishment of debt or preferred stock that we exclude from our Core FFO, may provide a benefit or cost to us as we may be settling our obligation at less or more than our future obligation. 

49 

Index 

We compensate for these limitations by using our FFO measures only in conjunction with net earnings computed under GAAP when making our decisions. This information should be read with our complete Consolidated Financial Statements prepared under GAAP. To assist investors in compensating for these limitations, we reconcile our modified FFO measures to our net earnings computed under GAAP for the nine months ended September 30 as follows (in millions):

ITEM 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 
 We are exposed to the impact of foreign exchange-related variability and earnings volatility on our foreign investments and interest rate changes. See our risk factors in Part 1, Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. See also Note 9 in the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1 for more information about our foreign operations and derivative financial instruments. 
 
 We monitor our market risk exposures using a sensitivity analysis. Our sensitivity analysis estimates the exposure to market risk sensitive instruments assuming a hypothetical 10 adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates or interest rates at September 30, 2024. The results of the sensitivity analysis are summarized in the following sections. The sensitivity analysis is of limited predictive value. As a result, revenues and expenses, as well as our ultimate realized gains or losses with respect to foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate fluctuations will depend on the exposures that arise during a future period, hedging strategies at the time and the prevailing foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. 
 
 Foreign Currency Risk 
 
 We are exposed to foreign currency exchange variability related to investments in and earnings from our foreign investments. Foreign currency market risk is the possibility that our results of operations or financial position could be better or worse than planned because of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We primarily hedge our foreign currency risk by borrowing in the currencies in which we invest thereby providing a natural hedge. Additionally, we hedge our foreign currency risk by entering into derivative financial instruments, such as foreign currency contracts, that we designate as net investment hedges, as these amounts offset the translation adjustments on the underlying net assets of our foreign investments. At September 30, 2024, after consideration of our ability to borrow in the foreign currencies in which we invest and also derivative and nonderivative financial instruments as discussed in Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, we had minimal net equity denominated in a currency other than the U.S. dollar. 
 
 50 

Index 

 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, 434 million or 7.2 of our total consolidated revenue was denominated in foreign currencies. We enter into foreign currency contracts that we do not designate, such as forwards, to reduce the impact from fluctuations in foreign currency associated with the translation of the future earnings of our international subsidiaries. At September 30, 2024, we had foreign currency contracts denominated principally in British pound sterling, Canadian dollar, euro and Japanese yen, with an aggregate notional amount of 1.6 billion. As we do not designate these foreign currency contracts as hedges, the gain or loss on settlement is included in our earnings and offsets the lower or higher translation of earnings from our investments denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Although the impact to net earnings is mitigated through higher translated U.S. dollar earnings from these currencies, a weakening of the U.S. dollar against these currencies by 10 could result in a 163 million cash payment on settlement of these contracts. 
 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 
 We are also exposed to the impact of interest rate changes on future earnings and cash flows. To mitigate that risk, we generally borrow with fixed rate debt and we may use derivative instruments to fix the interest rate on our variable rate debt. At September 30, 2024, 31.2 billion of our debt bore interest at fixed rates and therefore the fair value of these instruments was affected by changes in market interest rates. At September 30, 2024, 1.7 billion of our debt bore interest at variable rates. The following table summarizes the future repayment of debt and scheduled principal payments at September 30, 2024 (dollars in millions):

(1) The weighted average interest rates represent the effective interest rates (including amortization of debt issuance costs and noncash premiums and discounts) for the debt outstanding and include the impact of designated interest rate swaps, which effectively fix the interest rate on certain variable rate debt. 

At September 30, 2024, the weighted average effective interest rate on our variable rate debt was 2.7 which was calculated using an average balance on our credit facilities throughout the year and our other variable rate debt balances at September 30, 2024. Changes in interest rates can cause interest expense to fluctuate on our variable rate debt. On the basis of our sensitivity analysis, a 10 increase in interest rates on our average outstanding variable rate debt balances would result in additional annual interest expense of 4 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, which equates to a change in interest rates of 27 basis points on our average outstanding variable rate debt balances and one basis point on our average total debt portfolio balances.
