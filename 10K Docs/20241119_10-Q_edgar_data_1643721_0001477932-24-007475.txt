Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Forward Looking Statements This quarterly report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. These statements relate to future events or our future financial performance. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as may , should , expects , plans , anticipates , believes , estimates , predicts , potential or continue or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology. These statements are only predictions. While these forward-looking statements, and any assumptions upon which they are based, are made in good faith and reflect our current judgment regarding the direction of our business, actual results will almost always vary, sometimes materially, from any estimates, predictions, projections, assumptions or other future performance suggested in this report. Except as required by applicable law, we do not intend to update any of the forward-looking statements to conform these statements to actual results. Our unaudited interim condensed financial statements for the three months ended September 30, 2024 are expressed in US dollars and are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America. They reflect all adjustments (all of which are normal and recurring in nature) that, in the opinion of management, are necessary for fair presentation of our interim financial information. The results of operations for the interim periods presented are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for any subsequent quarter or for our fiscal year ending June 30, 2025. Our unaudited financial statements and notes included therein have been prepared on a basis consistent with and should be read in conjunction with our audited financial statements and notes for the year ended June 30, 2024, as filed in our annual report on Form 10-K. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our interim financial statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in this quarterly report. Business Overview Our company has evolved and grown from a listing website to a comprehensive marketing technology platform. Our clients, medical and recreational dispensaries, in legalized cannabis states, along with cannabis product companies subscribe to our technology platform to assist in new customer acquisition. We provide retention tools to those companies that include texting/loyalty and ordering ahead technology. The Leafbuyer Technology Platform reaches millions of cannabis consumers every month through its web-based platform, loyalty platform and smart application technology. Our website s sophisticated vendor dashboard allows our clients to update their menus, deals and create real-time messages to communicate with consumers 24/7/365. The platform also provides a robust reporting feature to track the vendors return on investment. With the increased popularity of Leafbuyer texting/loyalty program, clients can communicate through SMS, MMS as well as push notifications within a custom branded application. Our website, Leafbuyer.com, and its progressive web application, hosts a robust search algorithm like popular travel or hotel sites, where our clients customers can search the database for appealing offers. They can also search through thousands of menu items and products, create a profile, sign up to receive deal alerts and place online orders for pick up or delivery. In November of 2020 Leafbuyer Technologies Inc. completed a customizable white label application for the dispensary clients. Consumers can search, shop, earn rewards, place orders, and communicate with their favorite stores all in one convenient application. The application can also be completely branded for the dispensary and allows for 24/7 communication with their patrons. We continue an aggressive push into all legal cannabis states. Increasing our marketing and sales presence in new markets is a primary objective. Along with this expansion, we continue to develop innovative technologies that will serve cannabis dispensaries and product companies in attracting and retaining consumers. Leafbuyer operates in a rapidly evolving and highly regulated industry that, as has been estimated by grandviewresearch.com, to exceed 70 billion in revenue by the year 2028. Our founders and our Board of Directors have been, and will continue to be, aggressive in pursuing long-term opportunities. We plan to grow organically through the aggressive deployment of sales and marketing resources into legal cannabis states. We understand that to obtain a significant market share we may need to look for acquisitions for a sizable portion of that growth. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to locate and acquire such opportunities or that they will be on terms that are favorable to us. 18 Table of Contents The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, the Company has suffered recurring losses from operations and has a significant accumulated deficit. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. Management s plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 1. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. Comparison of results of operations for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 Three months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change Revenue 1,609,473 1,169,622 439,851 38 Cost of revenue 860,192 813,344 46,848 61 Gross profit 749,281 356,278 393,003 110 Total operating expenses 716,794 717,287 (493 (- Interest expense other income (20,985 (37,589 16,604 44 Net loss 11,502 (398,598 410,100 103 Revenues During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we generated 1.6 million of revenues, compared to revenues of 1.2 million during the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to the additional text services. Gross Profit Gross profit increased to 749,281 for the period ended September 30, 2024, which was an increase over the same period ended September 30, 2023 of 393,003. Gross profits increased in the quarter because the cost of third-party texting fees was included in our pricing agreements, unlike in 2023, cost of revenue increased, and the company did not have time to respond to the change in our pricing agreements. Expenses During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we incurred total operating expenses of 716,794 compared to 717,287 for the same period ending in 2023. The minimal decrease in operating costs is primarily because of lower stock- based compensation expense with an offset to an increase in bad debt expense. Interest expense was 20,986 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to interest expense of 37,624 for the same period ending September 30, 2023, because of the reduction in notes payable during the year. Net Income During the three months ended September 30, 2024 we realized a net income of 11,502, compared to a net loss of 398,598 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 19 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources The ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the Company generating profitable operations in the future and/or obtaining the necessary financing to meet its obligations and repay its liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due. Management intends to finance operating costs over the next twelve months from the date of the issuance of these unaudited condensed financial statements with existing cash on hand and/or the private placement of common stock or obtaining debt financing. There is, however, no assurance that the Company will be able to raise any additional capital through any type of offering on terms acceptable to the Company, as existing cash on hand will be insufficient to finance operations over the next twelve months. At September 30, 2024 we had 231,381 in cash and cash equivalents. Cash Flows Our cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities were as follows: Three months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Net cash (used in)/provided by operating activities 211,177 (185,479 Net cash used in investing activities - - Net cash used in financing activities (145,128 (57,311 As of September 30, 2024, we had 231,381 in cash and cash equivalents and a working capital deficit of 1,711,7491. We are dependent on funds raised through equity financing. Our accumulated deficit of 25,133,627 was funded by equity financing and we reported a net income from operations of 11,502 for the three months ended September 30, 2024. During the three months ending September 30, 2024, we paid 145,128 to reduce related parties debt, and we did not expend any monies through investing activities (acquiring assets). The Company realized more gross profit during the three months ending September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 which provided cash from operating activities and allowed the Company to pay down more debt in 2024 than 2023. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We had no off-balance sheet arrangements as of September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024. Critical Accounting Estimates Our condensed financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. We continually evaluate the accounting policies and estimates used to prepare the condensed financial statements. The estimates are based on historical experience and assumptions believed to be reasonable under current facts and circumstances. Actual amounts and results could differ from these estimates made by management. Certain accounting policies that require significant management estimates and are deemed critical to our results of operations or financial position are discussed in our June 30, 2024 form 10-K in the Critical Accounting Policies section of Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 20 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Policies Our unaudited condensed interim financial statements are affected by the accounting policies used and the estimates and assumptions made by management during their preparation. For a detailed discussion about the Company s significant accounting policies, refer to Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, in the Company s financial statements included in the Company s June 30, 2024 Form 10-K. We have identified below the accounting policies that are of particular importance in the presentation of our financial position, results of operations and cash flows, and which require the application of significant judgment by our management. Management has carefully considered the recently issued accounting pronouncements that altered generally accepted accounting principles and does not believe that any other new or modified principles will have a material impact on the Company s reported financial position or operations in the near term. Use of Estimates Management uses estimates and assumptions in preparing these condensed financial statements. Those estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and the reported revenues and expenses. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Revenue Recognition For revenue recognition arrangements that we determine are within the scope of Topic ASC 606, we perform the following five steps: (i) identify the contract(s) with a customer, (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract, (iii) determine the transaction price, (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract, and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. We only apply the five-step model to arrangements that meet the definition of a contract under Topic 606, including when it is probable that the entity will collect the consideration it is entitled to in exchange for the goods or services it transfers to the customer. At contract inception, once the contract is determined to be within the scope of Topic 606, we evaluate the goods or services promised within each contract related performance obligation and assess whether each promised good or service is distinct. We then recognize as revenue the amount of the transaction price that is allocated to the respective performance obligation when (or as) the performance obligation is satisfied. We recognize revenue upon completion of our performance obligations or expiration of the contractual time to use services such as bulk texting. Recent Accounting Guidance Adopted We have implemented all new accounting pronouncements that are in effect and applicable to us. These pronouncements did not have any material impact on our financial statements unless otherwise disclosed, and we do not believe that there are any other new accounting pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations. 21 Table of Contents Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are a smaller reporting company as defined by 17 C.F.R. 229 (10)(f)(i) and are not required to provide information under this item. Item 4. Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining a system of disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) that is designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the issuer s management, including its principal executive officer or officers and principal financial officer or officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. An evaluation was conducted under the supervision and with the participation of our management of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of June 30, 2024. Based on that evaluation, our management concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of such date to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms. Such officer also confirmed that there was no change in our internal control over financial reporting during the three months ended September 30, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the three months ended September 30, 2024, which have materially affected or would likely materially affect our internal control over financial reporting. The Company continues to invest resources in order to upgrade internal controls. 22 Table of Contents PART II OTHER INFORMATION Item 1.
