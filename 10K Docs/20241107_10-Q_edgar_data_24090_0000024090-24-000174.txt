 VALUATION OF INVESTMENTS 
 
 Available-for-sale ("AFS") fixed maturity securities are reported in the consolidated financial statements at fair value. Equity securities are measured at fair value with the change in fair value recorded through net income. The Company recognized net investment related gains of million for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, on equity securities held. The Company recognized net investment related losses of million and million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. 
 
 The Company considers several factors in its review and evaluation of individual investments, using the process described in Part IV, Item 15, Note 2. Investments in the notes to the consolidated financial statements of our Form 10-K to determine whether a credit valuation loss exists. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recorded credit valuation losses on fixed maturity securities.

and of the fair value of our fixed maturity securities portfolio, respectively, were rated investment grade. While the losses are currently unrealized, we continue to monitor all fixed maturity securities on an on-going basis as future information may become available which could result in an allowance being recorded. 
 
 These unrealized losses on fixed maturity securities are due to noncredit-related factors, including change in credit spreads and rising interest rates since purchase, which have little bearing on the recoverability of our investments, hence they are not recognized as credit losses. The fair value is expected to recover as the securities approach maturity or if market yields for such investments decline.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS VALUATION 
 
 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE 
 
 Fixed maturity securities, available-for-sale. At September 30, 2024, fixed maturity securities, valued using a third-party pricing source, totaled billion for Level 2 assets and comprised of total reported fair value of our financial assets. The Level 1 and Level 2 valuations are reviewed and updated quarterly through testing by comparisons to separate pricing models, other third-party pricing services, and back tested to recent trades. In addition, we obtain information annually relative to the third-party pricing models and review model parameters for reasonableness. There were Level 3 assets at September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, there were material changes to the valuation methods or assumptions used to determine fair values, and broker or third-party prices were changed from the values received. 
 
 Equity securities. Our equity securities are classified as Level 1 assets as their fair values are based upon quoted market prices. 
 
 Limited partnerships. The Company considers the net asset value ("NAV") to represent the value of the investment fund and is measured by the total value of assets minus the total value of liabilities. The following table includes information related to our investments in limited partnerships that calculate NAV per share. For these investments, which are measured at fair value on a recurring basis, we use the NAV per share to measure fair value. The Company recognized net investment related gains of million and million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and losses of million and gains of million on limited partnerships

 Cash and cash equivalents. The fair value of cash and cash equivalents approximates carrying value and are characterized as Level 1 assets in the fair value hierarchy. 
 
 Annuity liabilities.

The fair value of liabilities under all insurance contracts are taken into consideration in the overall management of interest rate risk, which seeks to minimize exposure to changing interest rates through the matching of investment maturities with amounts due under insurance contracts.

million for money had and received , an equitable theory that claimed that the Citizens Companies would be unjustly enriched if they didn t pay past and future commissions to Delgado and Landa. We accrued this expense at December 31, 2023. 
 
 On April 30, 2024, Defendants Riley (through his estate), Buchweitz and Delgado filed a motion against the Citizens Companies seeking payment of legal fees and a hearing was held on these matters on May 21, 2024. On July 26, 2024, the trial court awarded Riley and Buchweitz approximately million of their legal fees. We accrued this expense in the quarter ended June 30, 2024. 
 
 We do not believe the jury properly found that Delgado or Landa were entitled to any prior or future commissions as there was no evidence that we actually held any amount of commissions that they claim they should have received. We also do not believe that Riley or Buchweitz are entitled to legal fees because they were found to have breached the contracts whose fee shifting provisions they sought to invoke. 
 
 We have not paid any amounts to Delgado, Landa, Riley, Buchweitz or any of their attorneys and intend to appeal the judgment against us. We purchased and filed an appeal bond in September 2024 to supercede enforcement of the judgment during the appeal process. If we aren't successful in our appeal, we may have to pay approximately million as a result of the trade secret lawsuit. The accrued amounts are reflected as "other liabilities" on our balance sheet. Additionally, million that is reported in cash and cash equivalents on our balance sheet is restricted while the appeal bond remains in place.

 and ) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to and for the same periods in 2023, respectively. CICA Bermuda and CICA International are considered controlled foreign corporations for federal income tax purposes. As a result, the insurance activity of CICA Bermuda and CICA International are subject to Subpart F of the Internal Revenue Code and are included in Citizens taxable income. Due to the enacted tax rate in Bermuda for all periods prior to the transfer of CICA Bermuda's insurance in force business to CICA International, there are no deferred taxes recorded for CICA Bermuda's temporary differences. The Government of Puerto Rico approved a tax exemption decree for CICA International which freezes the income tax rate at on taxable earnings up to million and on taxable earnings in excess of million for a minimum of years. The effective tax rate varies from the prevailing corporate federal income tax rate of 21.0 mainly due to the impact of Subpart F and uncertain tax positions. 
 
 As a result of the August 31, 2023 transfer of CICA Bermuda's in force business to CICA International, the Company's consolidated deferred federal income tax liability was reduced by million due to the difference in the tax rates in the jurisdictions in which the companies operate. Since the transfer was between companies under common control, the million reduction in the deferred federal income tax liability was recorded as a credit to equity, million of which increased retained earnings and million of which reduced accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), based on the nature of the tax components.

Objective of our Management's Discussion and Analysis 
 
 We refer to our Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations as our MD A . The objective of our MD A is to provide investors with information in order to assess the material changes in our financial condition from December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024 and the material changes in our results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same periods in 2023. We also discuss in the MD A any trends that we believe may materially affect our future operations or financial condition. 
 
 OVERVIEW 
 
 For 55 years, we have been fulfilling the needs of our policyholders and their families by providing insurance products that offer both living and death benefits. Citizens conducts insurance related operations through its insurance subsidiaries, which provide benefits to policyholders globally. We specialize in offering primarily ordinary whole life insurance, endowment products and final expense insurance in niche markets where we believe we can optimize our competitive position. 
 
 As an insurance provider, we collect premiums on an ongoing basis from our policyholders and invest the majority of the premiums to pay future benefits, including claims, surrenders and policyholder dividends. Accordingly, the Company derives its revenues principally from: (1) life insurance premiums earned for insurance coverages provided to insureds in our two operating segments Life Insurance and Home Service Insurance; and (2) net investment income. In addition to paying and reserving for insurance benefits that we pay to our policyholders, our expenses consist primarily of the costs of selling our insurance products (e.g., commissions, underwriting, marketing expenses), operating expenses and income taxes.

 CITIZENS, INC. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION ANALYSIS 

 The Factors that Drive our Operating Results 
 
 We see the following as the primary factors that drive our operating results. 
 
 Sales i.e. , premium revenues) 
 Investments 
 Claims and surrenders 
 Operating expenses 
 Actuarial assumptions 
 
 Premium revenues and investment income are our two primary sources of revenue and thus key to our profitability. 
 
 Premium Revenues. Premium revenues consist of all money deposited by customers into new and existing insurance policies. We view these premiums in two categories - first year premiums are premiums received within the first 12 months of a policy's issuance and thereafter any premiums received are renewal premiums. 
 
 We believe premium statistics are meaningful to gaining an understanding of, among other things, the attractiveness of our new products, how expansion of our distribution channels affects our revenue, customer retention and the performance of our business from period-to-period. Throughout the MD A, we describe the actions and initiatives we are taking to increase sales and improve retention, sales performance in each period and as compared to the prior periods, and how we view trends with respect to sales and retention. 
 
 Over the last couple of years, we began our "white label" program to expand our distribution by expanding CICA Domestic's state licenses, developing new final expense and living benefit products, and filing these new products in multiple states. As a result, in the past year, we have significantly expanded our domestic distribution in the Life Insurance segment and first year premiums have almost doubled in this segment quarter-over-quarter and year-to-date as compared to 2023. We incur significant upfront costs in acquiring new business such as this, including the payment of sales commissions and underwriting costs, and thus in order to provide more capacity for growth, in the second quarter of 2024, we entered into a coinsurance agreement with RGA Reinsurance Company ("RGA"). Under this agreement, CICA Domestic initially elected for RGA to reinsure 50 of its newly written final expense business, which means that we cede 50 of premiums received and benefits paid in our domestic final expense business to RGA. We refer to "direct" premiums as all premiums received and "net" or "total" premiums as all premiums received less premiums ceded to RGA and our other reinsurers. 
 
 Because we ceased operations in our property insurance business effective June 30, 2023, the premiums charts below only reflect life insurance and accident and health insurance ("A H") direct premium results. 
 
 First Year Premiums. In addition to increased first year premiums due to our domestic growth discussed above, first year premiums in our international business have increased in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023 as we continue to work with our distribution partners to expand sales. 

Renewal Premiums. Our renewal life and A H premium revenues in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 slightly decreased primarily due to the impact of a higher level of surrenders and matured 
 
 September 30, 2024 | 10-Q 38 

Table of Contents 
 
 CITIZENS, INC. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION ANALYSIS 

 endowments in our international business during the last few years, which has led to a lower number of policies paying renewal premiums. 

Investment Income. Our net investment income increased for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same prior year periods, due primarily to investment income from our limited partnership investments and a growing diversified invested asset base. 

Claims and Surrenders. Payment of policyholder benefits for claims and surrenders is our largest expense and thus also key to our profitability. The three largest components of this expense are reflected in the graphs below. In the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year periods, 
 
 death claim benefits increased due to the significant growth in our domestic life in force business as well as a higher volume of reported claims in our Home Services Insurance segment, 
 surrenders decreased as we continue to focus on retention efforts, and 
 matured endowments increased as expected due to many of our endowment policies reaching their contractual maturity dates. 
 
 While surrenders and matured endowments do not significantly affect current profitability since reserves are released in a corresponding amount of the surrendered policy or matured endowment benefit payment, they 
 
 September 30, 2024 | 10-Q 39 

Table of Contents 
 
 CITIZENS, INC. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION ANALYSIS 

 negatively affect future renewal premium revenue and thus have a greater impact to future profitability versus current profitability. 
 
 Operating Expenses. Operating expenses are our second largest expense and thus also drive our operating results. Our general operating expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased compared to the prior year periods. The primary reason for the increase in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was the accrual of 3.5 million in legal fees awarded to certain defendants in the trade secret lawsuit. We have not paid any of these fees and intend to appeal the judgment against us. See Part I, Item 1, Note 8. Commitments and Contingencies , as well as Part II, Item 1, Legal Proceedings - Trade Secret Lawsuit for additional details. To a lesser extent, the increase was also due to our continued investment in the growth of our business and costs incurred as we transitioned to a new CEO. 
 
 Actuarial Assumptions. The actuarial assumptions that underlie our reserves are based upon our best estimates of mortality, lapses and discount rates. Our results will be affected to the extent there is a variance between our actuarial assumptions and actual experience. 
 
 As discussed above, our domestic growth in the Life Insurance segment has been significantly expanded. Our current profitability is affected by the amount of reserves we have to hold for this new business, and how closely actual experience matches our actuarial assumptions. The actuarial assumptions that underlie our reserves are 
 
 September 30, 2024 | 10-Q 40 

Table of Contents 
 
 CITIZENS, INC. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION ANALYSIS 

 based upon our best estimates of mortality and lapses and are inherently more difficult to predict for a new product line. Actuarial assumptions are continually monitored and are expected to become less volatile as this business matures and we develop more experience. 
 
 FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS 
 
 Our net income before federal income taxes decreased to 3.0 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 4.6 million in the three months ended September 30, 2023. While our revenues increased by 2.3 million due primarily to higher first year premiums and investment related gains, our net income decreased due primarily to (i) lower renewal premiums resulting from high surrenders and matured endowments in the past few years, and (ii) an increase in total benefits and expenses paid including (a) an increase in future policyholder benefit reserves primarily related to increases in our domestic life in force business and issuance of supplemental contracts; (b) policyholder remeasurement loss related to updating our actuarial assumptions in our CICA Domestic business; and (c) an increase in death claims. 
 
 Our net income before federal income taxes decreased from 17.4 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 11.3 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. In addition to the reasons described above, during the nine month period we accrued 3.5 million in legal fees awarded to the certain defendants in the trade secret lawsuit. 
 
 Our basic net income per share of Class A common stock was 0.06 and 0.23 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to 0.06 and 0.28 in the same prior year periods. 
 
 Financial Condition at September 30, 2024 
 
 Total assets of 1.7 billion 
 Total investments of 1.4 billion; fixed maturity securities comprised 88 of total investments

 EVENTS THAT IMPACTED OUR BUSINESS 
 
 From time-to-time, certain events may affect our business in ways that cause current or future results to differ from past results. See Part II, Item 7 - "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Events that Impacted Our Business" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the period ended December 31, 2023 for a discussion of certain events that have impacted and continue to impact our business, including inflation and market volatility, high interest rates and ceasing operations of our property insurance business. See also Part I, Item 1, Note 8. Commitments and Contingencies , as well as Part II, Item 1, Legal Proceedings - Trade Secret Lawsuit for a discussion of the trade secret lawsuit, which has impacted our results of operations and could negatively impact our cash if we do not succeed in our appeal.

OUR OPERATING SEGMENTS 
 
 We manage our business in two operating segments: Life Insurance and Home Service Insurance. 
 
 Our insurance operations are the primary focus of the Company, as these operations generate most of our income. See the discussion under Segment Operations below for a detailed analysis. The amount of direct insurance, number of policies, and average face amounts for ordinary life policies issued during the periods indicated are shown below.

 As we previously disclosed, our strategic initiatives include the introduction of new products tailored to our specific markets and expansion of our distribution channels both domestically and internationally. These new products and distribution channels helped drive the 74 increase in total insurance issued in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the prior year period. 
 
 The growth in our Life Insurance segment is primarily attributable to strong sales of our new domestic final expense products, which accounted for over half of the insurance issued through September 30, 2024. The Life Insurance segment also benefited from sales of our international whole life product, which accounted for 68 of total insurance issued internationally in this segment for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Insurance issued in our Home Service Insurance segment decreased for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year period largely due to strategic actions intended to improve sales quality and persistency, which led to a decrease in our agent sales force as we focus on these improvements. We also believe the impact of inflation on the cost of living has affected new sales since the customer demographic is primarily middle- and lower-income individuals.

 Total revenues increased in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the prior year periods, due to significantly higher first year life insurance premiums, investment related gains and higher other income in the nine month period due to supplemental contract revenue. 
 
 The Company stopped accepting premiums for property insurance at the end of May 2023 and ceased these operations on June 30, 2023. Therefore, the table below shows a summary of our life and A H premiums for the periods indicated.

 Premium Income. Direct premiums increased 5 and 6 in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023 due to strong first year premium growth in our Life Insurance segment. Renewal premiums decreased in both periods due to the high level of surrenders and matured endowments in the prior year, which negatively affect renewal premiums in the current periods. 
 
 Reinsurance ceded premiums increased in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods in 2023 due to our new coinsurance agreement with RGA entered in the second quarter of 2024 related to our CICA Domestic business.

 Net Investment Income. A summary of our net investment income and annualized net investment income performance is as follows: 
 
 Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 30, September 30, (In thousands, except for 2024 2023 2024 2023 Gross investment income: Fixed maturity securities 15,263 15,005 45,743 44,956 Equity securities 76 127 224 451 Policy loans 1,369 1,478 4,207 4,531 Long-term investments 1,151 1,249 3,643 3,261 Other investment income 230 166 651 430 Total investment income 18,089 18,025 54,468 53,629 Investment expenses (712) (653) (2,064) (1,942) Net investment income 17,377 17,372 52,404 51,687 Net investment income, annualized 69,872 68,916 Average invested assets, at amortized cost 1,522,602 1,520,389 Annualized yield on average invested assets 4.59 4.53 
 
 Due to insurance regulations, fixed maturity securities constitute the vast majority (or 88 of our investment portfolio based on fair value and thus provide the vast majority of our investment income. Our total investment income increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods in 2023, primarily due to a higher average portfolio yield on our fixed maturity securities in the current period. 
 
 Investment Related Gains (Losses), Net. We recorded investment related gains of 0.8 million and 1.5 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to investment related losses of 0.9 million and 0.5 million during the same prior year periods. The gains and losses are primarily related to the fair value change of our limited partnership and equity security investments, mostly in our Life Insurance segment, due to the volatility in equity markets over the past year. We did not sell these investments; however, the changes in fair values of our equity securities are reflected as investment related gains or losses in our income statement, in addition to executed transactions that result in a gain or loss. 
 
 Other Income. Other income consists primarily of supplemental contracts issued to international policyholders in our Life Insurance segment upon the surrender or maturity of their original policies. Supplemental contracts offer our policyholders the opportunity to leave their cash with us and be paid interest at a guaranteed rate or receive an annuity, at their option.

 Payments of claims and surrenders benefits constitute the majority of our expenses. Total benefits and expenses increased in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to same periods in 2023 driven primarily by the costs related to our new CICA domestic business, as described above as well as a higher volume of reported claims in our Home Services Insurance segment. The 3.5 million accrual of legal fees awarded to the defendants in the trade secret lawsuit, reflected in other general expenses, also contributed to the increase in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Claims and Surrenders. 
 Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 30, September 30, (In thousands) 2024 2023 2024 2023 Claims and surrenders:

 Death claim benefits are being impacted by the increase in policies issued over the past few years and an increase in volume of claims reported in our Home Service Insurance segment. 
 
 Surrender benefits decreased in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods in 2023. Surrenders are primarily related to international policies that have passed their surrender charge period. We have implemented retention initiatives over the past few years, which we believe are helping to decrease surrenders.

 CITIZENS, INC. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION ANALYSIS 

Matured endowment benefits increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods in 2023. We anticipated this increase based upon the contractual maturity dates of the policies. 
 
 Increase (Decrease) in Future Policy Benefit Reserves. Future policy benefit reserves reflect the liability established to provide for the payment of policy benefits that we expect to pay in the future and thus generally increase when we have a larger in force block of business due to higher sales and better persistency (i.e., more policies on which we expect to pay future benefits) and decrease when we have lower sales and persistency. In the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the change in future policy benefit reserves increased due to the amount of reserves on new insurance issued and the in force book of business somewhat offset by released reserves in connection with higher matured endowments. 
 
 Policyholder Liability Remeasurement (Gain) Loss. Most of our products are long-duration contracts that provide a specified, fixed amount of insurance benefit in exchange for a fixed premium. When a policy is initially issued, we establish a "net premium ratio" ("NPR") using assumptions regarding expected premiums and policyholder benefit liabilities. On a quarterly basis, we review actual versus expected experience in such quarter, which is reported as a policyholder liability remeasurement gain (if better performance than assumptions) or loss (if lower performance than assumptions). Additionally, in the third quarter of each year, we update our cash flow assumptions to recalculate the NPR, with the impact on the liability for future policy benefits recognized as a policyholder liability remeasurement on a retrospective catch-up basis. In 2024, remeasurement (gain) loss was negatively affected by updates to mortality and lapse assumptions that better reflect emerging experience for the new CICA Domestic block of business. 
 
 Commissions. Commission expenses are a cost of acquiring business, as commissions are the primary compensation paid to our independent consultants and independent agents for selling our products. First year commission rates are higher than renewal commission rates and thus commissions fluctuate directly in relation to first year sales. The increases in first year sales in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 led to an increase in commission related expenses in both periods as compared to the prior year periods. 
 
 Capitalization of Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs. We capitalize costs related to successful sales of our insurance products, which include certain commissions, policy issuance costs, and underwriting and agency expenses. These costs vary based upon amounts of premiums received related to new and renewal business. Capitalized DAC increased in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, which is in line with the increases in new sales activity. Significantly lower amounts are capitalized related to renewal business in correlation with the lower commissions paid on that business compared to first year business, which has higher commission rates. 
 
 Amortization of Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs. Amortization of DAC increased in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same periods in 2023. DAC is amortized on a constant level basis over the expected term of the related contracts to approximate straight-line amortization. 

SEGMENT OPERATIONS 
 
 We operate in two business segments: 
 
 Life Insurance 
 Home Service Insurance 
 
 These segments are reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The Company evaluates profit and loss performance based on net income before federal income taxes for these segments. The Company's Other Non-Insurance Enterprises include non-insurance operations such as IT and corporate-support functions, which are included in the table presented below to properly reconcile the segment information with the consolidated financial statements of the Company.

 Premiums. Our total premiums increased by 3 and 6 in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to the same periods in 2023 due to the 62 and 78 increase, net of reinsurance, respectively, in first year premiums. First year premiums rose significantly due to sales of our new products and expanded domestic distribution. Renewal premiums decreased in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same prior year periods. As described above, this decline is due to high surrenders and matured endowments over the last several years. 
 
 The increase in reinsurance ceded premiums in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same periods in 2023, is due to our new coinsurance agreement with RGA entered in the second quarter of 2024 related to our CICA Domestic business. 
 
 While our domestic life insurance business drove the significant increase in first year premiums, life insurance premiums are generated largely from our international policyholders living in 80 different countries across the globe. The following table sets forth our premiums by location for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

 Investment Related Gains (Losses), Net. We recorded investment related gains of 0.9 million and 1.7 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to investment related losses of 0.4 million and 0.1 million during the same prior year periods, resulting primarily from the change in estimated fair market value of our limited partnership investments. 
 
 Claims and Surrenders. The following table sets forth our primary claims and surrender benefits paid within our Life Insurance segment for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods in 2023. 
 
 Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 30, September 30, (In thousands) 2024 2023 2024 2023 Claims and surrenders:

 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the majority of our claims and surrender benefits in our Life Insurance segment were related to payment of surrender benefits and matured endowment benefits. Many of our endowment policies are reaching their contractual maturity dates and thus matured endowment benefits are increasing. We expect this trend to continue over the next few years. Surrender benefits decreased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year periods which we believe is due to our retention efforts. Death claim benefits increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the prior year period as we saw a higher number of reported claims due to the increase in policies issued, primarily in our new domestic business. Mortality experience is closely monitored by the Company as a key performance indicator and fluctuates from quarter-to-quarter based on reported claims. 
 
 Increase (Decrease) in Future Policy Benefit Reserves. The change in future policy benefit reserves for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was the result of reserves released due to surrenders and higher matured endowment benefits. These releases were partially offset by increases in reserves due to insurance issued and normal increases in our in force block of business policy benefit reserves. 
 
 Policyholder Liability Remeasurement (Gain) Loss. The third quarter update to mortality and lapse assumptions for CICA Domestic negatively affected our policyholder liability remeasurement loss. This was partially offset by better than expected surrender experience in our international business.

 In our Home Service Insurance segment, we reported a loss before federal income tax of 0.1 million and income of 2.0 million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to loss of 0.4 million and income of 1.5 million in the prior year periods. The higher income is primarily driven by a decrease in other general expenses and partially due to ceasing our property insurance operations as of June 30, 2023, which also impacted premium revenue, somewhat offset by higher death claims.

 CITIZENS, INC. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION ANALYSIS 

 Premiums. Our life and A H premiums declined in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same prior year periods. The decrease is largely due to strategic actions intended to improve sales quality and persistency, which actions led to a decrease in our agent sales force as we focus on these improvements. Additionally, we believe external economic pressures, such as inflation, have impacted revenue in this segment disproportionately. 
 
 Claims and Surrenders. Payments of claims and surrender benefits, which are the largest portion of our expenses, are summarized as follows: 
 
 Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 30, September 30, (In thousands) 2024 2023 2024 2023 Claims and surrenders:

 The majority of claims and surrender benefits in our Home Service Insurance segment are death claim benefits. Death claim benefits increased in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same prior year periods due to higher volume of reported claims. Mortality experience is closely monitored by the Company as a key performance indicator and fluctuates from quarter-to-quarter based on reported claims. 
 
 Other General Expenses. General expenses decreased in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods in 2023, primarily due to ceasing our property insurance business as discussed above.

 This operating unit represents the administrative support functions for the insurance operations. Its revenues are primarily intercompany and have been eliminated in consolidation under U.S. GAAP, which typically results in a loss. Revenue in this operating unit consists primarily of net investment income and investment related gains or losses, while expenses consist of other general expenses related to corporate functions. The primary reason for the increased loss before federal income tax in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 is the legal accrual described above. 

INVESTMENTS 
 
 Our investments are an integral part of our business success. Our cash and invested assets at September 30, 2024 were 1.5 billion, of which 86 was invested in fixed maturity securities, all of which are classified as available-for-sale. We closely monitor the duration of our fixed maturity investments, and investment purchases and sales are executed with the objective of having adequate funds available to satisfy our insurance obligations.

 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 
 Below are our primary capital resources (based on carrying value of each) as of the periods indicated.

 Fixed maturity securities 1,273,497 1,238,981 Cash and cash equivalents 32,382 26,997 
 
 Liquidity refers to a company's ability to generate or obtain sufficient cash to meet the needs of its operations. Our liquidity is primarily derived from our cash flow from operations, our cash and cash equivalents, and our portfolio of marketable securities. We may also derive liquidity by accessing our Credit Facility (described below) or may raise capital by selling shares in our SIP (as defined below) or by other traditional means. Citizens has no debt as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 Cash from Operating Activities. Cash provided by operating activities is an important liquidity metric because it reflects, during a given period, the amount of cash generated that is available to pay our operating expenses, invest in our business or make strategic acquisitions. In the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our operations provided 21.1 million in net cash. 
 
 Cash from Investing Activities. We have traditionally also had significant cash flows from both scheduled and unscheduled investment security maturities, redemptions, and prepayments. These cash flows, for the most part, are reinvested in new investments. In the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we had net cash outflows from investing activities of 13.3 million as we continue to invest excess funds in this high interest rate environment. The investing activities fluctuate from period to period due to timing of security activities such as calls and maturities and reinvestment of those funds. 86 of our total cash, cash equivalents and investments consist of marketable fixed maturity securities classified as available-for-sale that could be readily converted to cash for liquidity needs. 

PARENT COMPANY LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 
 Citizens is a holding company and has minimal operations of its own. Citizens' assets consist of the capital stock of its subsidiaries, cash and investments. Citizens' liquidity requirements are met primarily from two sources: cash generated from its operating subsidiaries and its invested assets. Citizens' ability to obtain cash from its insurance subsidiaries depends primarily upon the availability of statutorily permissible payments, including payments Citizens receives from service agreements with its insurance subsidiaries and dividends from the subsidiaries. The ability to make payments to the holding company is limited by applicable laws of the U.S. states of domicile and by the Puerto Rico Office of Commissioner of Insurance, which all subject insurance operations to significant regulatory restrictions. These laws and regulations require, among other things, that our insurance subsidiaries maintain minimum solvency or premium to surplus ratio requirements, which limit the amount of dividends that can be paid to the holding company. The regulations also require approval of our service agreements with the applicable regulatory authority in order to prevent insurance subsidiaries from moving large amounts of cash to the less regulated holding company. 
 
 In addition to the above-mentioned sources of cash, we offer a Stock Investment Plan ("SIP"), whereby investors, policyholders, independent contractors and agents, employees and directors can directly purchase our stock. At our option, purchases of stock under the SIP can be made from newly issued or treasury stock, rather than in the open market, in which case, we can raise capital by selling our shares. 
 
 We renewed our Credit Facility with Regions Bank on May 3, 2024 for an additional three years. See Part I, Item 1, Note 8. Commitments and Contingencies in the notes to our consolidated financial statements, herein, for a description of the Credit Facility. The Credit Facility provides additional liquidity to the Company for short-term or longer-term needs. As of September 30, 2024, we have not borrowed any money under the Credit Facility.

 CITIZENS, INC. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION ANALYSIS 

INSURANCE COMPANY SUBSIDIARY LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 
 The liquidity requirements of our insurance operations are primarily met by premium revenues, investment income and proceeds from investment maturities, calls or sales. Primary cash needs are for payments of policyholder benefits, investment purchases, policy acquisition costs and other operating expenses. We manage our insurance operations in order to ensure that we have stable and reliable sources of cash flow to meet our obligations. As we have discussed, we have been growing our domestic business by developing new products and expanding our distribution channels, which has led to an increase in first year premiums (i.e. , new sales) of 50 from 2023 to 2024. When selling new policies, we incur upfront policy acquisition costs, such as agent commission payments. While historically, cash flows from our operations have been sufficient to meet our cash needs, we have entered into a reinsurance agreement with RGA to help with some of the costs, and the insurance companies also have the available-for-sale fixed maturity investment portfolio available to create additional cash flows if required. Two of our insurance subsidiaries are members of the Federal Home Loan Bank ("FHLB") of Dallas. FHLB membership provides the insurance subsidiaries with access to various low-cost collateralized borrowings and funding agreements. While not the only source of additional liquidity, the FHLB could provide the insurance subsidiaries with an additional source of liquidity, if needed. 
 
 We believe that we have adequate capital resources and ability to obtain additional capital if needed to support the short-term and longer-term liquidity requirements of our insurance operations. See Contractual Obligations and Off-balance Sheet Arrangements in our Form 10-K and below for a discussion of known and estimated cash needs. Cash flow projections and cash flow tests under various market interest rate scenarios are performed annually to assist in evaluating liquidity needs and adequacy. 
 
 Trends, Demands and Restrictions on our Uses of Cash 
 
 Because claims and surrenders are our largest expense, a primary liquidity concern is the risk of either (i) an extraordinary level of early policyholder surrenders, or (ii) higher than expected mortality experience. Our death benefit payments increased in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, which is expected as the amount of insurance issued has increased significantly over the past couple of years. Surrender benefits, which have been higher than usual the last several years, slightly decreased in the first nine months of 2024. In order to mitigate the risk of early policyholder surrenders, we include provisions in our insurance policies, such as surrender charges, that help limit and discourage early withdrawal, but as many of our policies have reached the age where surrender charges have expired or significantly decreased, we have experienced high levels of surrenders. We believe that surrenders have been high due to other reasons, including the loss of one of our biggest distributors in Venezuela in 2018, increasing interest rates, which may encourage policyholders to seek higher rates of returns in different investment products, post-pandemic beliefs that life insurance may not be as important as it was during the pandemic, and inflationary pressures, which may cause policyholders to want the cash values of their policies due to decreased purchasing power elsewhere. To the extent that early surrenders are higher than expected, our liquidity could be negatively impacted due to benefit payments as well as lower renewal premiums. We continue to monitor surrenders and early withdrawals and focus on our retention initiatives. 
 
 Our endowment products have contractual maturity dates and provide the policyholder with alternatives once the policy matures - they can choose to take a lump sum payout or leave the money on deposit at interest with the Company. Approximately 17 of the endowments in force, totaling approximately 6 of our in force business as of September 30, 2024, will mature in the next five years. Policyholder election behavior is unknown, but if too many policyholders elect lump sum distributions, the Company could be exposed to liquidity risk in years of high maturities. Meeting these distributions could require the Company to sell its investments at inopportune times to pay policyholder withdrawals. Alternatively, if the policyholders were to leave the money on deposit with the Company at interest, our profitability could be impacted if the product guaranteed rate is higher than the market rate we are earning on our investments. We currently anticipate that our available operating cash flow and capital resources will be adequate to meet our needs for funds, but we are closely monitoring our policyholder behavior patterns.

 CITIZENS, INC. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION ANALYSIS 

 In our CICA Domestic business, we pay advance commissions on some of our insurance products, meaning we pay an agent their commission immediately upon sale of a policy, rather than "as earned", or when premiums are received by us. Because of this, another liquidity concern is the risk that rapid growth in first year sales of these products could create a significant increase in commission payments, which increases expenses and thus reduces our statutory capital until the commissions are recouped from premiums paid. CICA Domestic sales have increased significantly since the third quarter of 2023 and continue to grow rapidly. To mitigate this risk and strain on capital, we entered into a coinsurance agreement with RGA in the second quarter of 2024 and elected to cede 50 of our final expense business to RGA, which alleviates some of the strain on expenses. We may also seek other options, such as loans at the holding company level (from the Credit Facility or otherwise) that would allow us to reduce the liquidity risk should CICA Domestic's required commission payments exceed current resources. If we are unable to borrow money to contribute capital to CICA Domestic, we could be exposed to cash flow strain. 
 
 See Part I, Item 1, Note 8. Commitments and Contingencies , as well as Part II, Item 1. Legal Proceedings - Trade Secret Lawsuit, for a discussion of the trade secret lawsuit, which could negatively impact our cash if we do not succeed in our appeal. 
 
 Regulatory Restrictions on our Use of Cash 
 
 As discussed above, we are subject to regulatory capital requirements that could affect the Company s ability to access capital from our insurance operations or cause the Company to have to put additional cash in our wholly-owned subsidiaries. 
 
 Our domestic companies are subject to minimum capital requirements set by the NAIC in the form of risk-based capital ("RBC"). RBC considers the type of business written by an insurance company, the quality of its assets, and various other aspects of an insurance company's business to develop a minimum level of capital called "Authorized Control Level Risk-Based Capital". This level of capital is then compared to an adjusted statutory capital that includes capital and surplus as reported under statutory accounting principles, plus certain investment reserves. Should the ratio of adjusted statutory capital to control level RBC fall below 200 for our domestic companies, a series of remedial actions by the affected company would be required. Additionally, we have a Capital Maintenance Agreement between Citizens and CICA Domestic, Citizens' wholly-owned subsidiary domiciled in Colorado, that would require Citizens to contribute capital to CICA Domestic in order to maintain a RBC level above 350 . At September 30, 2024, our domestic insurance subsidiaries were above the required minimum RBC levels and CICA Domestic was above 350 . 
 
 For CICA Domestic, commission advances are non-admitted assets, which increases required regulatory capital and reduces the excess capital available. As discussed above, management is investigating various options in order to reduce both regulatory capital and liquidity risk should the capital required to support this pace of growth exceed current resources. Citizens may have to contribute capital to CICA Domestic to maintain the required RBC ratio. 
 
 CICA International is a Puerto Rico domiciled company. The Insurance Code of Puerto Rico does not specifically set forth minimum capital and surplus standards, but rather requires that an insurer submit a business plan for approval to the OIC that includes proposed minimum capital and surplus. CICA International is required to maintain a minimum of 750,000 in capital and maintain a premium to surplus ratio of 7 to 1. CICA International began issuing new business as of January 1, 2023 and received the transfer of all of CICA Bermuda's in force insurance business as of August 31, 2023. At September 30, 2024, CICA International exceeded the required minimum capital and related ratio. 
 
 Any capital that Citizens is required to contribute to its insurance subsidiaries could negatively impact the Company's capital resources and liquidity.

Item 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 
 EVALUATION OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 
 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act")) that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. 
 
 Our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act as of September 30, 2024. Based on such evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024 to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC and such information is accumulated and reported to management, including our principal executive and financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding disclosure. 
 
 CHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING 
 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, there were no changes in the Company's internal control over financial reporting (as defined in rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
 
 Trade Secret Lawsuit 
 
 In the first quarter of 2024, a jury trial was held in the trade secret lawsuit . The trade secret lawsuit was filed in 2018 by Citizens, CICA Life Ltd. (Bermuda) and CICA Life Insurance Company of America (collectively, the Citizens Companies, we, "us" or "our") against certain former employees and independent consultants who we alleged unlawfully took Citizens confidential information in order to unfairly compete with us. Our claims against these parties included various unfair competition, tortious interference, breach of contract and other related claims. 
 
 As previously disclosed, the jury found that Citizens should pay Alexis Delgado and Carlos Nalsen Landa, former independent consultants, approximately 1.3 million for money had and received , an equitable theory that claimed that the Citizens Companies would be unjustly enriched if they didn t pay past and future commissions to Delgado and Landa. Additionally, the trial court awarded defendants Michael P. Buchweitz Buchweitz and Randall Riley Riley approximately 3.5 million of their legal fees. On August 16, 2024, the judge signed a Final Judgment reflecting the jury decision and the court award of the legal fees. We do not believe the jury properly found that Delgado or Landa were entitled to any prior or future commissions as there was no evidence that we actually held any amount of commissions that they claim they should have received. We also do not believe that Riley or Buchweitz are entitled to legal fees because they were found to have breached the contracts whose fee shifting provisions they sought to invoke. 
 
 We intend to appeal the judgment against us and accordingly on September 16, 2024, we filed a Limited Motion for Partial New Trial on these issues. On September 17, 2024, we filed an appeal bond with the court in order to stay any execution of the judgment against us.
