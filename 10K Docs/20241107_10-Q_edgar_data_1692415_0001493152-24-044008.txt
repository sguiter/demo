The
Company s financial instruments that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis consist of U.S. treasury bills and notes as
of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 

The
fair value of contingent consideration is calculated using a discounted probability weighted valuation model. Discount rates used in
such calculations are a significant assumption that are not observed in the market, and therefore, the resulting fair value represents
a Level 3 measurement. 

Change in fair value of contingent consideration issued for business acquisitions 

Fair value as of September 30, 2024 

The
fair value of the contingent consideration is based on the fair value of the contingent consideration-common stock and contingent consideration-warrants.
The fair value of the contingent consideration-common stock is equal to the probability-adjusted value of the Company s common
stock as of the valuation date. The fair value of the contingent consideration-warrants is equal to the probability adjusted value of
a call option with terms consistent with the terms of the warrants as of the valuation date. Prior to the probability adjustments, the
warrants were valued based on the following inputs: 

Strike price 

Volatility 

Risk-free rate 

Expected term (years) 

Fair
Value of Other Financial Instruments 

The
carrying amounts of certain financial instruments, including cash held in banks, accounts receivable, notes receivable, accounts payable,
accrued liabilities, and other liabilities approximate fair value due to their short-term maturities and are excluded from the fair value

press releases to increase the price of our stock to improperly benefit the officers and directors of the Company. The plaintiffs demand
compensatory damages sustained as a result of the Company s alleged wrongdoing in an amount to be proven at trial. The Company
is also a party to three civil actions, two in the US and the other in the United Kingdom. Each of the civil actions is based on breach
of contract claims against the Company. The Company believes these lawsuits are without merit and intends to defend the cases vigorously.
The Company is unable to estimate a range of loss, if any, that could result were there to be an adverse final decision in these cases.
As of the date of this report, the Company does not believe it is probable that these cases will result in an unfavorable outcome; however,
if an unfavorable outcome were to occur in these cases, it is possible that the impact could be material to the Company s results

Business
Overview 

Co-Diagnostics,
Inc., a Utah corporation (the Company or CODX ), develops, manufactures and sells reagents used for diagnostic
tests that function via the detection and/or analysis of nucleic acid molecules (DNA or RNA), including robust and innovative molecular
tools for detection of infectious diseases, liquid biopsy for cancer screening, and agricultural applications. Our diagnostics systems
enable dependable, low-cost, molecular testing for organisms and genetic diseases by automating or simplifying historically complex procedures
in both the development and administration of tests. CODX s technical advance involves a novel, patented approach to PCR test design
of primer and probe structure Co-Primers that eliminates one of the key vexing issues of PCR amplification: the
exponential growth of primer-dimer pairs (false positives and false negatives) which adversely interferes with identification of the
target DNA/RNA. Using our proprietary test design system and proprietary reagents, we have designed and obtained regulatory approval
to sell PCR diagnostic tests for the detection of COVID-19, influenza, tuberculosis, hepatitis B and C, human papillomavirus, malaria,
chikungunya, dengue, and the Zika virus. These initial diagnostic tests are cleared for use in clinical labs only and not for point-of-care
or at-home use. 

We
are currently developing a unique, groundbreaking portable diagnostic device and test system designed for point-of-care and at-home use.
The system is comprised of our PCR instrument that we refer to as the Co-Dx PCR Pro instrument, our proprietary diagnostic
test cup system and a mobile application to be installed on the user s mobile device. We refer to the system as the Co-Dx 
PCR platform that is being designed to bring affordable, reliable polymerase chain reaction PCR testing to patients in
point-of-care and at-home settings. The Co-Dx PCR platform is subject to U.S. Food and Drug Administration FDA review
and is not available for sale at the time of this filing. In June 2024, we completed our first U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
application for 510(k) clearance for the Co-Dx PCR Pro instrument, and the Co-Dx PCR COVID-19 Test for over-the-counter
(OTC) use. We have received acknowledgement from the FDA that the 510(k) application was received and is under review. Additionally,
in December 2023, we submitted the Co-Dx PCR platform for review by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for Emergency Use Authorization
(EUA). There is no guarantee that our Co-Dx PCR platform will receive the necessary regulatory approvals for commercialization, or that,
if regulatory approval is received, we will be able to successfully commercialize this platform.

Technology 

We
believe our proprietary molecular diagnostics technology is paving the way for innovation in disease detection and life sciences research
through our enhanced detection of genetic material. For various reasons, including owning our own platform, we believe we will be able
to accomplish this faster and more economically than some competitors, allowing for significant margins while still positioning ourselves
as a low-cost provider of molecular diagnostics and screening services. For example, we were the first US-based company to receive a
CE-marking for a COVID-19 test in early 2020, as we worked to help slow the spread of the pandemic through our global network of distributors
covering clinical labs in more than 50 countries. Our Logix Smart COVID-19 test was designed, developed, submitted for regulatory
approval and ready to be used as an in vitro diagnostic or IVD in countries that accept a CE Mark as approval for use of the test in
a period of just over 30 days. This is a real-world example of how the CODX technology can be used in an evolving epidemic or pandemic
to get diagnostic tools in the hands of medical professionals in a timely manner. It can be similarly used to design a test for mutated
strains of the virus should they not be detectable using currently available tests. 

In
addition, continued development has demonstrated the unique properties of our CoPrimer technology that we believe makes it ideally suited
for a variety of applications where specificity is key to optimal results, including multiplexing several targets, enhanced Single Nucleotide
Polymorphism SNP detection and enrichment for next generation sequencing. 

Our
scientists use the complex mathematics of DNA/RNA PCR test design to engineer and optimize PCR tests and to automate algorithms that
rapidly screen millions of possible options to pinpoint the optimum design. The intellectual property we use in our business consists
of the predictive mathematical algorithms and patented molecular structure used in the testing process, which together represent a major
advance in PCR testing systems. CODX technologies are now protected by more than 20 granted or pending US and foreign patents, as well
as certain trade secrets and copyrights. Ownership of our proprietary platform permits us the advantage of avoiding payment of patent
royalties required by other PCR test systems, which may allow the sale of diagnostic PCR tests at a lower price than competitors, while
enabling us to maintain profit margins. 

Our
proprietary test design process involves identifying the optimal locations on the target genes for amplification and pair the locations
with the optimized primer and probe structure to achieve outputs that meet the design input requirements identified from market research.
This is done by following planned and documented processes, procedures and testing. In other words, we use the data resulting from our
tests to verify whether we succeeded in designing what we intended. Verification involves a series of testing that concludes that the
product is ready to proceed to validation in an evaluation either in our laboratory or in an independent laboratory setting using initial
production tests to confirm that the product as designed meets the user needs. 

Using
our proprietary test design system and proprietary reagents, we have designed and obtained regulatory approval in the European Community
and in India to sell PCR diagnostic tests for the detection of COVID-19, influenza, tuberculosis, hepatitis B and C, human papillomavirus,
malaria, chikungunya, dengue, and the Zika virus. In the United States, we obtained Emergency Use Authorization EUA for
our Logix Smart COVID-19 detection test from the Food and Drug Administration, or
FDA, and we sell that test to qualified labs. In addition, our COVID-19 detection test and certain of our other suite of COVID-19 products
have been approved for sale in countries such as the United Kingdom, Australia and Mexico by the regulatory bodies in those countries
and have been registered for sale in many more countries. In connection with the sale of our tests we may sell diagnostic equipment from
other manufacturers as self-contained lab systems (which we refer to as the MDx Device ). 

In
addition to testing for infectious disease, the technology lends itself to identifying any section of a DNA or RNA strand that describes
any type of genetic trait, which creates several significant applications. We, in conjunction with our customers, have designed and licensed
tests that identify genetic traits in plant and animal genomes. We also have three multiplexed tests developed to test mosquitos for
the identification of diseases carried by the mosquitos to enable municipalities to concentrate their efforts in managing mosquito populations
on the specific areas known to be breeding the mosquitos that carry deadly viruses. 

RESULTS
OF OPERATIONS 

The
Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to the Three Months ended September 30, 2023 

Revenues 

For
the three months ended September 30, 2024, we generated revenues of 641,141, compared to revenues of 2,457,098 for the three months
ended September 30, 2023. Grant revenue accounted for 434,265 of revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to
 2,320,565 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in grant revenue was primarily due to the timing of the achievement
of certain milestones under various grants the Company was awarded. 

19 

Cost
of Revenues 

We
recorded cost of revenues of 297,403 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 255,772 for the three months ended
September 30, 2023. The increase in cost of revenues is primarily due to higher inventory obsolescence costs recorded in
the current quarter versus the prior year comparable period. 

Expenses 

We
incurred total operating expenses of 10,578,675 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to total operating expenses
of 11,137,277 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in operating expenses was primarily due to decreased stock-based
compensation expense, and expense related to clinical trials for the Co-Dx PCR platform. These decreases were partially offset by increased
legal expenses. 

Our
sales and marketing expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were 1,059,745, compared to 1,904,395 for the three months
ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily a result of decreased stock-based compensation expense, tradeshow and travel expenses,
and outside consulting and professional services expenses. 

General
and administrative expenses were 4,287,380 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 3,147,753 for the three months
ended September 30, 2023. The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to increased legal expenses, partially
offset by decreases in stock-based compensation expense and professional services expenses. 

Our
research and development expenses were 4,880,315 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 5,788,789 for the three
months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily a result of decreased expenses related to development of and clinical trials
for the Co-Dx PCR platform and stock-based compensation expense, partially offset by increases in consulting and professional
services expenses. 

Other
Income 

For
the three months ended September 30, 2024 we had total other income of 560,671, compared to total other income of 840,176 for the three
months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in other income is primarily due to a change in the fair value of contingent consideration
liabilities and decreased realized gains from investments in marketable securities. 

Net
Loss 

We
realized a net loss for the three months ended September 30, 2024 of 9,696,455, compared to a net loss for the three months ended September
30, 2023 of 5,982,194. The increase in net loss was primarily the result of a decrease in grant revenue, partially offset by a decrease
in operating expenses, as well as changes in the fair value of acquisition contingencies and income related to investments in marketable
securities. Additionally, we recorded income tax expense of 22,189 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to an income
tax benefit of 2,113,581 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The primary reason for the change in the provision for income
taxes is a result of the Company now being in a full valuation allowance. 

The
Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to the Nine Months ended September 30, 2023 

Revenues 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we generated revenues of 3,765,835, compared to revenues of 3,256,861 for the nine months
ended September 30, 2023. Grant revenue accounted for 3,145,112 of revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to
 2,320,565 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in product revenue of 315,573 was primarily due to lower sales
of our Logix Smart COVID-19 test throughout the world. The increase in grant revenue was primarily due to the achievement of certain
milestones under various grants the Company was awarded. 

20 

Cost
of Revenues 

We
recorded cost of revenues of 744,056 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 1,217,108 for the nine months ended
September 30, 2023. The decrease in cost of revenues of 473,052 is primarily due to lower inventory obsolescence reserves being recorded
in the current year versus the prior year comparable period. 

Expenses 

We
incurred total operating expenses of 31,196,065 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to total operating expenses of
 32,920,793 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in operating expenses was primarily due to decreased stock-based
compensation expense, bad debt expense and expense related to development of and clinical trials for the Co-Dx PCR platform. These decreases
were partially offset by increased personnel related expenses and legal expenses. 

Our
sales and marketing expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 3,664,670, compared to 5,343,692 for the nine months
ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily a result of decreased stock-based compensation expense, tradeshow and travel expenses,
website development expenses and personnel related expenses. 

General
and administrative expenses were 10,338,568 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 9,875,613 for the nine months
ended September 30, 2023. The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to increased legal expenses, partially
offset by decreases in stock-based compensation expense, bad debt expense, professional services expense and insurance expense. 

Our
research and development expenses were 16,172,684 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 16,783,892 for the nine
months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily a result of decreased expenses related to development of and clinical trials
for the Co-Dx PCR platform and stock-based compensation expense, partially offset by increases in personnel, consulting and professional
services expenses. 

Other
Income 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we had total other income of 1,632,013, compared to total other income of 3,612,918 for the
nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in other income is primarily due to a change in the fair value of contingent consideration
liabilities, an increased loss related to the Company s joint venture investment, and decreased realized gains from investments
in marketable securities, partially offset by increased interest income. 

Net
Loss 

We
realized a net loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 of 26,607,816, compared to a net loss for the nine months ended September
30, 2023 of 20,656,410. The larger net loss was primarily the result of changes in the fair value of acquisition contingencies and income
taxes, partially offset by an increase in grant revenue combined with a decrease in operating expenses. We recorded income tax expense
of 65,543 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to an income tax benefit of 6,611,712 for the nine months ended September
30, 2023. The primary reason for the change in the provision for income taxes is a result of the Company now recording a full valuation
allowance. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

At
September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of 10,797,630. Additionally, we had 26,864,571 of marketable investment securities
that could readily be converted into cash if needed. Additionally, our total current assets of September 30, 2024, were 40,103,158 compared
to total current liabilities of 5,797,977. 

Net
cash used in operating activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 20,924,039, compared to 17,303,239 for the
nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in cash used in operating activities was primarily due to a decrease in cash
collections from customers and granting agencies and the impact of non-cash items. 

Net
cash provided by investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 16,804,791, primarily from maturities of marketable
investment securities, compared to 5,773,590 during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

Net
cash used in financing activities was 0 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 1,204,256 for the same period in
the prior year. This is due to the repurchase of outstanding common shares during the prior period, compared to no such repurchases in
the current period. 

21 

Since
commencing sales of our Logix Smart COVID-19 test in March 2020, we have used our cash generated from those sales to fund the purchase
of inventories and the development of our Co-Dx PCR platform, and to pay our operating expenses. We have increased our work force most
significantly in research and development in order to continue development of the Co-Dx PCR platform and additional tests that will enable
continued use of our distributor network to sell additional products throughout the world. 

We
believe that our existing capital resources and the cash generated from future sales will be sufficient to meet our projected operating
requirements for the next 12 months. However, our available capital resources may be consumed more
rapidly than currently expected and we may need or want to raise additional financing for strategic opportunities. It is anticipated
that the Company will continue to generate operating losses and use cash in operations in the near term. If
needed, we expect additional investment capital to come from additional issuances of our common stock or other equity-based securities
with existing and new investors similar to those that have provided funding in the past. On March 16, 2023, the Company entered into
an Equity Distribution Agreement with Piper Sandler Co. Piper ), pursuant to which we may sell from time to time,
shares of our common stock, having an aggregate offering price of up to 50.0 million through Piper, as agent. The Company is subject
to General Instruction I.B.6 of Form S-3 which limits the amounts that we may sell under the Equity Distribution Agreement over a 12-month
period to an amount equal to or less than one-third of our public float. On October 18, 2024, the Company filed a Prospectus Supplement
with the SEC reducing the amount available for sale under the Equity Distribution Agreement to 17.1 million. No shares have been sold
under the distribution agreement as of September 30, 2024. We may not be able to secure financing in a timely manner or on favorable
terms, if at all.

or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not, of itself,

6.1 or Section 6.2, as applicable. Such determination shall be made (i) by the board of directors by a majority vote of a quorum consisting
of directors who were not parties to such action, suit, or proceeding or (ii) if such quorum is not obtainable or, even if obtainable,
as a quorum of disinterested directors so directs, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion, or (iii) by the stockholders. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, a director, officer, employee, or agent of the corporation shall be entitled to contest any determination that the director,

Section
6.8. The Corporation. For purposes of this Article VI references to the corporation shall include, in addition to the

opposed to the best interests of the corporation as referred to in this Article VI.

6.10. Indemnity Fund. Upon resolution passed by the board, the corporation may establish a trust or other designated account, grant
a security interest or use other means (including, without limitation, a letter of credit), to ensure the payment of certain of its obligations
arising under this Article VI and/or agreements which may be entered into between the corporation and its officers and directors from
time to time. 

Section
6.11. Indemnification of Other Persons. The provisions of this Article VI shall not be deemed to preclude the indemnification of

employee, or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, or other enterprise, but whom the corporation has the power
or obligation to indemnify under the URBCA or otherwise. The corporation may, in its sole discretion, indemnify an employee, trustee,

 it would be inconsistent with a provision of the certificate of incorporation, these bylaws, a resolution of the stockholders or
 an agreement in effect at the time of the accrual of the alleged cause of the action asserted in the proceeding in which the expenses
 were incurred or other amounts were paid, which prohibits or otherwise limits indemnification; or

(b) 
 such
 inability becomes known to the secretary or an assistant secretary of the corporation or to the transfer agent, or other person responsible
 for the giving of notice. 

However,
 the inadvertent failure to treat such inability as a revocation shall not invalidate any meeting or other action. 

Any
 notice given pursuant to the preceding paragraph shall be deemed given: 

(1) 
 if
 by facsimile telecommunication, when directed to a number at which the stockholder has consented to receive notice; 

(2) 
 if
 by a posting on an electronic network together with separate notice to the stockholder of such specific posting, upon the later of
 (A) such posting and (B) the giving of such separate notice; and

 by a posting on an electronic network together with separate notice to the stockholder of such specific posting, upon the later of
 (A) such posting and (B) the giving of such separate notice; and 

(4) 
 if
 by any other form of electronic transmission, when directed to the stockholder. 

An
affidavit of the secretary or an assistant secretary or of the transfer agent or other agent of the corporation that the notice has been
given by a form of electronic transmission shall, in the absence of fraud, be prima facie evidence of the facts stated therein. 

Section
8.2. Definition of Electronic Transmission. An electronic transmission means any form of communication, not directly

Any or all of the signatures on the certificate may be a facsimile. In case any officer, transfer agent or registrar who has signed or
whose facsimile signature has been placed upon a certificate has ceased to be such officer, transfer agent, or registrar before such
certificate is issued, it may be issued by the corporation with the same effect as if he were such officer, transfer agent, or registrar
at the date of issue. 

The
corporation may issue the whole or any part of its shares as partly paid and subject to call for the remainder of the consideration to
be paid therefor. Upon the face or back of each stock certificate issued to represent any such partly paid shares, upon the books and
