 NOTES
TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)

million revolving credit facility with Comerica Bank Comerica (the Comerica
Loan Agreement ). In February 2024, the Company terminated the Comerica Loan Agreement. The Company did not owe anything outstanding
on the line of credit at the time of termination and does not owe anything further to Comerica. See Note 16, Revolving Line of Credit .
Also in October 2021, the Company entered into an million term loan with BroadOak Fund V, L.P. BroadOak (the Term
Loan ), the proceeds of which were used to repay in full at their maturity the existing secured promissory note with Ampersand
Capital Partners Ampersand and 1315 Capital II, L.P 1315 Capital ). In May 2022, the Company entered into
a Subordinated Convertible Promissory Note agreement with BroadOak for an additional million (the Convertible Note ),
which was converted into a subordinated term loan and was added to the outstanding Term Loan balance. The Term Loan has been subsequently
amended. See Note 13, Notes Payable , for more details. 

Along
with many laboratories, the Company may be affected by the Proposed Local Coverage Determination LCD DL39365, which is
currently under consideration by Novitas, the Company s medical administrator contractor. If finalized, this Proposed LCD, which
governs Genetic Testing for Oncology, could impact the existing Medicare coverage for one of our molecular tests, PancraGEN .
On June 5, 2023, the Company announced that Novitas issued the final LCD of Genetic Testing for Oncology (L39365) which if finalized,
would have established non-coverage for the Company s widely used PancraGEN test effective July 17, 2023. On July
6, 2023, Novitas announced that it would not be implementing the final Genetic Testing for Oncology LCD (L39365) as scheduled on July
17, 2023. Novitas then issued a new virtually identical proposed LCD affecting the same companies and tests and reaching the same conclusions
as noted in the previously rescinded LCD on July 27, 2023. In response, the Company participated in a public meeting presentation and
submitted detailed written comments supporting the use of PancraGEN . The timing and content of any final implemented
LCD is uncertain at this time; the process could potentially take a year or longer from issuance of the updated proposed LCD to reach
a conclusion. On July 29, 2024 the Company announced that CMS granted Novitas an undefined extension to the final decision for the LCD.
As a result, the Company is able to continue offering PancraGEN and the related Point2 fluid chemistry
tests for amylase, CEA, and glucose. In the event Novitas ultimately restricts coverage for the PancraGEN test, the Company s
liquidity could be negatively impacted. 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company had operating income from continuing operations of million. As of September
30, 2024, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of million, total current assets of million and current liabilities of
 million. As of November 1, 2024, the Company had approximately million of cash and cash equivalents. 

The
Company intends to meet its ongoing capital needs by using its available cash, as well as through targeted margin improvement; collection
of accounts receivable; containment of costs; and the potential use of other financing options and other strategic alternatives. 

The
Company continues to explore various strategic alternatives, dilutive and non-dilutive sources of funding, including equity and debt
financings, strategic alliances, business development and other sources in order to provide additional liquidity. With the delisting
of its common stock from Nasdaq in February 2021, the Company s ability to raise additional capital on terms acceptable to it has
been adversely impacted. There can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in obtaining such funding on terms acceptable
to it. 

On
October 10, 2024, Ampersand and 1315 Capital exchanged (the Exchange shares of the Company s Series B convertible
preferred stock of the Company, par value per share (the Series B Preferred Stock for shares of the Company s
Series C Preferred Stock, par value per share (the Series C Preferred Stock ). See Note 18, Subsequent Events .
The Company believes that the shares of Series C Preferred Stock will constitute stockholders equity under generally accepted
accounting principles. The Exchange is the first significant step for the Company to seek an uplisting of its common stock to Nasdaq.
Other steps may need to be taken in order to satisfy Nasdaq listing requirements, including meeting Nasdaq s stockholder equity
and minimum bid price requirements. The Company believes that a Nasdaq listing would assist it in raising additional capital, increasing
investor interest and trading volume in its common stock, and pursuing acquisitions. No assurance can be given that a Nasdaq listing
will be achieved. 

With
the improvement in operating cash flows associated with the disposition of the Pharma Solutions business, and the Company s improved
operating performance, as of the date of this filing, the Company anticipates that current cash and cash equivalents and forecasted cash
receipts will be sufficient to meet its anticipated cash requirements through the next twelve months from the date of the filing of this
report.

The
Company reviews the recoverability of long-lived assets and finite-lived intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable. If the sum of the expected future undiscounted cash flows is
less than the carrying amount of the asset, an impairment loss is recognized by reducing the recorded value of the asset to its fair
value measured by future discounted cash flows. This analysis requires estimates of the amount and timing of projected cash flows and,
where applicable, judgments associated with, among other factors, the appropriate discount rate. Such estimates are critical in determining
whether any impairment charge should be recorded and the amount of such charge if an impairment loss is deemed to be necessary. 

per share, used in the calculation of basic and diluted income

In
instances where the determination of the fair value measurement is based on inputs from different levels of the fair value hierarchy,
the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the entire fair value measurement falls is based on the lowest level input that is
significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. The Company s assessment of the significance of a particular input to
the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the asset or liability. The valuation
methodologies used for the Company s financial instruments measured on a recurring basis at fair value, including the general classification
of such instruments pursuant to the valuation hierarchy, is set forth in the tables below:

In
connection with the acquisition of certain assets from Asuragen, Inc., the Company recorded contingent consideration related to contingent
payments and other revenue-based payments. The Company determined the fair value of the contingent consideration based on a probability-weighted
income approach derived from revenue estimates. The fair value measurement is based on significant inputs not observable in the market
and thus represents a Level 3 measurement. 

In
connection with the Term Loan, the Company records the loan at fair value. The fair value of the loan is determined by a probability-weighted
approach regarding the loan s change in control feature. See Note 13, Notes Payable , for more details. The fair value measurement
is based on the estimated probability of a change in control and thus represents a Level 3 measurement.

. Funding
of the Term Loan took place on November 1, 2021. The Term Loan was scheduled to mature upon the earlier of (i) or (ii)
the occurrence of a change in control, and bears interest at the rate of per annum. The Term Loan is secured by a security interest
in substantially all of the Company s and its subsidiaries assets and was subordinate to the Company s revolving
credit facility with Comerica Bank. See Note 16, Revolving Line of Credit . of the Term
Loan amount, and a terminal payment equal to (i) 15 of the original principal amount of the Term Loan if the change of control occurs
on or prior to the first anniversary of the funding of the Term Loan, (ii) 20 of the original principal amount of the Term Loan if the
change of control occurs after the first anniversary but on or prior to the second anniversary of the funding of the Term Loan and (iii)
30 of the original principal amount of the Term Loan if the change of control occurs after the second anniversary of the funding of the
Term Loan, or if the Term Loan is repaid on its maturity date. 

The Term Loan contains affirmative and negative
restrictive covenants that are applicable from and after the date of the Term Loan advance. These restrictive covenants, which include
restrictions on certain mergers, acquisitions, investments, encumbrances, etc., could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business.
The Term Loan also contains customary events of default. 

The Company concluded that the Term Loan
met the definition of a recognized financial liability which is an acceptable financial instrument eligible for the fair
value option under ASC 825-10-15-4, and did not meet the definition of any of the financial instruments listed within ASC 825-10-15-5
that are not eligible for the fair value option. The Note is not convertible and does not have any component recorded to stockholders 
deficit. Accordingly, the Company elected the fair value option for the Note. 

In May 2022, the Company issued a convertible
note to BroadOak, pursuant to which BroadOak funded a term loan in the aggregate principal amount of million, which was converted
into a subordinated term loan and was added to the outstanding balance of the Term Loan. 

On October 24, 2023, the Company entered
into a Second Amendment to Loan and Security Agreement (the Second Amendment with BroadOak. The primary changes to the
original Term Loan were as follows: 

The Company made a one-time payment in an aggregate amount equal to , on October 30, 2023 and applied the payment in full satisfaction of the Terminal Payment (as defined in the Term Loan). See above regarding the Terminal Payment. 

Effective November 1, 2023, the interest rate under the Term Loan was reduced from to through the maturity date of or earlier, upon the occurrence of a change in control Loan Maturity Date ). 

The Company had the option to request an extension of the Loan Maturity Date in writing no less than sixty days prior to the Loan Maturity Date. If BroadOak agreed to the extension, the Loan Maturity Date would automatically be extended. 

On March 29, 2024, the Company entered into
a Third Amendment to Loan and Security Agreement with BroadOak (the Third Amendment ). The primary changes to the Second
Amendment were as follows: 

Beginning April 1, 2024, the Company will make monthly payments with the remaining loan balance due on the new maturity date. 

The Third Amendment was treated as a debt
modification which is accounted for prospectively. Since the Term Loan is carried at fair value under the fair value option, the Second
Amendment did not result in any extinguishment gain or loss upon amendment, and the impact of the revised terms was incorporated into
the Company s first quarter 2024 fair value calculation. 

The balance of the loan outstanding at September
30, 2024 was million. 

Purchase of property and equipment included in accounts payable 

million in Series B Preferred Stock of the Company, at an issuance price per share of New Investment Shares ). Pursuant
to the Securities Purchase and Exchange Agreement, 1315 Capital agreed to purchase shares of Series B Preferred Stock at an aggregate
purchase price of million and Ampersand agreed to purchase shares of Series B Preferred Stock at an aggregate purchase price
of million. 

In addition, the Company agreed to exchange
 million of the Company s existing Series A convertible preferred stock, par value per share, held by Ampersand (the
 Series A Preferred Stock ), represented by shares of Series A Preferred Stock with a stated value of per share,
which represents all of the Company s issued and outstanding Series A Preferred Stock, for newly issued shares of Series
B Preferred Stock (such shares of Series B Preferred Stock, the Exchange Shares and such transaction, the Exchange ).
Following the Exchange, shares of Series A Preferred Stock remained designated, authorized, issued or outstanding. The Series B Preferred
Stock has a conversion price of . On October 10, 2024, the Investors (as defined below) exchanged their shares of Series B Preferred
Stock for shares of Series C Preferred Stock with a conversion price of . See Note 18, Subsequent Events. 

Voting 

On any matter presented to the stockholders
of the Company for their action or consideration at any meeting of stockholders of the Company (or by written consent of stockholders
in lieu of meeting), each holder of outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock will be entitled to cast the number of votes equal
to the number of whole shares of the Company s common stock into which the shares of Series B Preferred Stock held by such holder
are convertible as of the record date for determining stockholders entitled to vote on such matter. Except as provided by law or by the
Certificate of Designation of Preferences, Rights and Limitations of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock (the Series B Certificate
of Designation ), holders of Series B Preferred Stock will vote together with the holders of common stock as a single class and
on an as-converted to common stock basis. 

Director Designation Rights 

On November 15, 2023, Edward Chan, a director
designated by 1315 Capital to the Board, provided notice to the Company of his resignation from the Board, effective immediately. Further,
on December 7, 2023, Robert Gorman, a director designated by Ampersand to the Board, provided notice to the Company of his resignation
as a director and as Chairman of the Board, effective immediately. 

As of the date of this report, each of 1315
Capital and Ampersand has appointed one director to the Board, and each has not appointed a second director to the Board. 

Conversion 

The Series B Certificate of Designation
provides that from and after the Issuance Date and subject to the terms of the Series B Certificate of Designation, each share of Series
B Preferred Stock is convertible, at any time and from time to time, at the option of the holder into a number of shares of common stock
equal to dividing the amount equal to the greater of the Stated Value of such Series B Preferred Stock, plus any dividends declared but
unpaid thereon, or such amount per share as would have been payable had each such share been converted into common stock immediately prior
to a liquidation, by six dollars (subject to adjustment in the event of any stock dividend, stock split, combination, or other
similar recapitalization affecting such shares). The aggregate number of shares of common stock that may be issued through conversion
of all of the New Investment Shares and Exchange Shares is shares (subject to appropriate adjustment in the event of any stock
dividend, stock split, combination or other similar recapitalization affecting such shares). 

Mandatory Conversion 

If the Company consummates the sale of shares
of common stock to the public in a firm-commitment underwritten public offering pursuant to an effective registration statement under
the Securities Act pursuant to which the price of the common stock in such offering is at least equal to twelve dollars (subject
to adjustment in the event of any stock dividend, stock split, combination, or other similar recapitalization affecting such shares) and
such offering does not include warrants (or any other convertible security) and results in at least in proceeds, net of the
underwriting discount and commissions, to the Company, and the common stock continues to be listed for trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market
or another exchange, all outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock will automatically be converted into shares of common stock, at
the then effective Series B Conversion Ratio (as defined in the Series B Certificate of Designation). 

Liquidation 

Upon any voluntary or involuntary liquidation,
dissolution or winding up of the Company or Deemed Liquidation (as defined in the Series B Certificate of Designation) (a Liquidation ),
the holders of shares of Series B Preferred Stock then outstanding will be entitled to be paid out of the assets of the Company available
for distribution to its stockholders (on a pari passu basis with the holders of any class or series of preferred stock ranking on liquidation
on a parity with the Series B Preferred Stock), and before any payment will be made to the holders of common stock or any other class
or series of preferred stock ranking on liquidation junior to the Series B Preferred Stock by reason of their ownership thereof, an amount
per share of Series B Preferred Stock equal to the greater of (i) the Stated Value of such share of Series B Preferred Stock, plus any
dividends declared but unpaid thereon, or (ii) such amount per share as would have been payable had each such share been converted into
common stock immediately prior to such Liquidation. 

As of September 30, 2024 and December 31,
2023, there were issued and outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock, respectively. See Note 18, Subsequent Events ,
for updates regarding the status of the Series B Preferred Stock. 

(the
 Credit Facility ). The Company could use the proceeds of the Credit Facility for working capital and other general corporate
purposes. 

On October 6, 2023, effective September
30, 2023, the Company entered into a Fifth Amendment to its Loan and Security Agreement (the Fifth Amendment to the Comerica Loan
Agreement with Comerica providing for a revolving credit facility of up to . 

In February 2024, the Company terminated
the Comerica Loan Agreement. The Company did not owe anything outstanding on the line of credit at the time of termination and does not
owe anything further to Comerica. 

Accounting Pronouncements
Pending 

In November 2023, the FASB
modified authoritative guidance within the codification s Segment Reporting topic (ASC 280), which enhanced the disclosure requirements
for significant segment expenses and other segment items. The authoritative guidance will become effective for fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 2023, and for interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. The Company will adopt the standard
as of the effective date. 

In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09,
Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures. This ASU requires public entities, on an annual basis, to provide disclosure
of specific categories in the rate reconciliation, as well as disclosure of income taxes paid disaggregated by jurisdiction. ASU 2023-09
is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the
impact the adoption of this standard on its financial statements. 

shares of the Company s Series B Preferred Stock,
comprised of shares of Series B Preferred Stock held by Ampersand and shares of Series B Preferred Stock held by 1315 Capital,
which represented all of the Company s issued and outstanding Series B Preferred Stock, for newly created shares of Series
C Preferred Stock, at an issuance price per share of . In the Exchange, Ampersand received shares of Series C Preferred Stock
and 1315 received shares of Series C Preferred Stock. 

The
Series C Preferred Stock is convertible into the Company s common stock at a conversion price of per share of common stock
(subject to further adjustment in the event of any stock dividend, stock split, combination, or other similar recapitalization affecting
such shares) which was the closing price of the common stock on the date of the Exchange Agreement. The Series C Preferred Stock does
not have a liquidation preference over the common stock in the event of a sale or dissolution of the Company, does not have director designation
rights and includes limited customary protective provisions. The Series B Preferred Stock had a conversion price of per share of
common stock and included additional protective provisions not applicable to the Series C Preferred Stock, including (i) limitations on
the Board to declare dividends, (ii) director designation rights for each of the Investors, (iii) liquidation rights of holders upon deemed
liquidation events, including a liquidation preference over the common stock, (iv) limitations on the ability to authorize, issue
or create debt securities, (v) limitations on the ability to enter into mergers or acquisitions and (vi) limitations on the ability to
conduct public offerings of the Company s common stock. See Note 15, Mezzanine Equity . The Series C Preferred Stock is convertible
into shares of common stock. 

In
connection with the Exchange, on October 11, 2024 the Company filed a Certificate of Designation of Preferences, Rights and Limitations
of Series C Convertible Preferred Stock (the Series C Certificate of Designation ), with the Secretary of State of the State
of Delaware. The Series C Certificate of Designation set forth the rights and obligations of the Series C Preferred Stock, including with
respect to voting rights, conversion rights, certain protective provisions and liquidation rights. Please refer to the Company s
current report on Form 8-K, filed with the SEC on October 15, 2024, for more information. 

The
closing of the transactions contemplated by the Exchange Agreement occurred on October 11, 2024, following the satisfaction of customary
conditions set forth in the Exchange Agreement and did not result in the receipt of any cash proceeds by the Company.

Forward-looking statements include statements preceded by, followed by or that include the words believes, expects, 
 anticipates, plans, estimates, intends, projects, should, 
 could, may, will or similar words and expressions. These forward-looking statements are contained
throughout this Form 10-Q. 

Forward-looking statements are
only predictions and are not guarantees of future performance. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions involving
judgments about, among other things, future economic, competitive and market conditions and future business decisions, all of which are
difficult or impossible to predict accurately and many of which are beyond our control. These predictions are also affected by known and
unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results to be materially different from those expressed or implied
by any forward-looking statement. Many of these factors are beyond our ability to control or predict. Our actual results could differ
materially from the results contemplated by these forward-looking statements due to a number of factors. Such factors include, but are
not limited to, the following: 

our history of operating losses prior to fiscal 2023; 

our expectations of future revenues, expenditures, capital or other funding requirements; 

our reliance on Medicare reimbursement for our clinical services and our being subject to decisions of the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services CMS regarding reimbursement and pricing of our clinical services which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results; 

our ability to continue to perform, bill and receive reimbursement for our PancraGEN molecular test long-term under the existing local coverage determination LCD ), given that such LCD is currently under review by Novitas, the Company s Medicare administrative contractor; 

our secured lender has the right to foreclose on substantially all of our assets if we are unable to timely repay our outstanding obligations; 

our dependence on sales and reimbursements from our clinical services for all of our revenue; 

the ability to continue to generate sufficient revenue from our clinical service products and other products and/or solutions that we develop in the future is important for our ability to meet our financial and other targets; 

our ability to finance our business on acceptable terms in the future, which may limit the ability to grow our business, develop and commercialize products and services, develop and commercialize new molecular clinical service solutions and technologies; 

our obligations to make royalty and milestone payments to our licensors; 

our dependence on third parties for the supply of some of the materials used in our clinical services tests;

OVERVIEW 

We are a fully integrated commercial
company that provides molecular diagnostics, bioinformatics and pathology services for evaluation of risk of cancer by leveraging the
latest technology in personalized medicine for improved patient diagnosis and management. We develop and commercialize genomic tests and
related first line assays principally focused on early detection of patients with indeterminate biopsies and at high risk of cancer using
the latest technology. 

Impact of Our Reliance on CMS and Novitas 

Along with many laboratories,
we may be affected by the Proposed LCD DL39365, which is currently under consideration by our local Medicare Administrative Contractor,
Novitas. If finalized, this Proposed LCD, which governs Genetic Testing for Oncology, could impact the existing Medicare
coverage for one of our molecular tests, PancraGEN . On June 5, 2023 we announced that Novitas issued the final LCD of
Genetic Testing for Oncology (L39365) which, if finalized, would have established non-coverage for the Company s widely used PancraGEN 
test effective July 17, 2023. On July 6, 2023, Novitas announced that it would not be implementing the final Genetic Testing for Oncology
LCD (L39365) as scheduled on July 17, 2023. Novitas then issued a new virtually identical proposed LCD affecting the same companies and
tests and reaching the same conclusions as noted in the previously rescinded LCD on July 27, 2023. In response, the Company participated
in a public meeting presentation and submitted detailed written comments supporting the use of PancraGEN . The timing and
content of any final implemented LCD is uncertain at this time; the process could potentially take a year or longer from issuance of the
updated proposed LCD to reach a conclusion. On July 29, 2024 the Company announced that CMS granted Novitas an undefined extension to
the final decision for the LCD. As a result, we are able to continue offering PancraGEN and the related Point2 
fluid chemistry tests for amylase, CEA, and glucose. In the event Novitas ultimately restricts coverage for the PancraGEN 
test, the Company s liquidity could be negatively impacted.

U.S. Food and Drug
Administration Regulation of LDTs 

While subject to oversight by
CMS through its enforcement of the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 CLIA ), the Food and Drug Administration FDA has claimed regulatory authority over laboratories that produce LDTs, a type of in vitro diagnostic test that is designed,
manufactured and used within a single laboratory. The FDA has regulatory responsibility over, among other areas, instruments, test kits,
reagents and other devices used in clinical laboratories to perform diagnostic testing in the United States. 

Historically, the FDA has exercised
enforcement discretion over most LDTs. On April 29, 2024, however, the FDA published a final rule on LDTs, in which the FDA outlines its
plans to end enforcement discretion for many LDTs in five stages over a four-year period. In Phase 1 (effective May 6, 2025), clinical
laboratories running LDTs will be required to comply with medical device (adverse event) reporting and correction/removal reporting requirements,
as well as requirements for maintenance of complaint files under the FDA s quality systems regulation (QSR). In Phase 2 (effective
May 6, 2026), clinical laboratories will be required to comply with all other device requirements (e.g., registration/listing, labeling,
investigational use), except for the remaining QSR requirements and premarket review. In Phase 3 (effective May 6, 2027), clinical laboratories
will be required to comply with all remaining applicable QSR requirements. In Phase 4 (effective November 6, 2027), clinical laboratories
will be required to comply with premarket review requirements for high-risk tests (i.e., tests subject to the premarket approval (PMA)
requirement). Finally, in Phase 5 (effective May 6, 2028), clinical laboratories will be required to comply with premarket review requirements
for moderate- and low-risk tests (i.e., tests subject to the de novo or 510(k) requirement). 

Under the final rule, several
types of tests will be eligible for some degree of continued enforcement discretion. For example, LDTs approved by the New York State
Department of Health will be exempt from premarket review requirements but will remain subject to the requirements of Phases 1 through
3. Similarly, LDTs first marketed prior to May 6, 2024 that are not subsequently modified, or are modified only in certain limited ways,
will be exempt from the premarket review and most quality systems requirements, but will remain subject to the requirements of Phases
1 and 2. The FDA notes, however, that it retains discretion to pursue enforcement action for violations of the Federal Food, Drug and
Cosmetic Act at any time and intends to do so when appropriate. The FDA further explains that it may update any of the enforcement discretion
policies set forth in the final rule as circumstances warrant or if the circumstances that inform those policies change, consistent with
the FDA s good guidance practices. 

To the extent the FDA ultimately
regulates certain LDTs, our LDTs may be subject to certain additional regulatory requirements. Complying with the FDA s requirements
can be expensive, time-consuming, and subject us to significant or unanticipated delays. Insofar as we may be required to obtain premarket
clearance or approval to perform or continue performing an LDT, we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain such authorization.
Even if we obtain regulatory clearance or approval where required, such authorization may not be for the intended uses that we believe
are commercially attractive or are critical to the commercial success of our tests. As a result, the application of the FDA s requirements
to our tests could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 

Failure to comply with applicable
requirements could result in a range of enforcement actions by the FDA, such as warning letters, civil monetary penalties, injunctions,
criminal prosecution, recall or seizure, operating restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown of operations, and denial of or
challenges to applications for clearance or approval, as well as significant adverse publicity. 

23 

Legislative proposals have also
been introduced that, if enacted, would potentially supersede the final rule. In March 2017, members of Congress posted a discussion draft
of The Diagnostics Accuracy and Innovation Act . The discussion draft included language that, if enacted, would have established
a new regulatory framework for the oversight of in vitro clinical tests IVCTs which include LDTs. In March 2020, members
of Congress introduced The Verifying Accurate, Leading-edge IVCT Development (VALID) Act. This bill has been re-introduced
in substantially similar forms over the years, and, most recently in March 2023. Under the most recent version of the VALID Act, a risk-based
approach would be used to regulate IVCTs while grandfathering many existing IVCTs from certain requirements. Each test will be classified
as high-risk, moderate-risk, or low-risk. Pre-market review will be required for high-risk tests. To market a high-risk IVCT, reasonable
assurance of analytical and clinical validity for the intended use must be established. Under VALID, a precertification process would
be established which will allow a laboratory to establish that the facilities, methods, and controls used in the development of certain
IVCTs meet quality system requirements. If pre-certified, IVCTs falling within the scope of a certification order will not be subject
to pre-market review. The new regulatory framework would include quality control and post-market reporting requirements. The FDA would
have the authority to withdraw from the market IVCTs if there is a reasonable likelihood that such tests will cause death or serious adverse
health consequences (among other criteria). Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements could result in enforcement action
by the FDA, such as fines, product suspensions, warning letters, recalls, injunctions and other civil and criminal sanctions. However,
we cannot predict if this (or any other bill) will be enacted in its current (or any other) form and cannot quantify the effect of such
proposals on our business. 

Whether via statute, regulation,
or sub-regulatory action, any FDA effort to end enforcement discretion for LDTs is likely to continue to be met with resistance by certain
sections of industry. Multiple lawsuits have been filed challenging the April 2024 LDT final rule, in which the plaintiffs argue that
the FDA lacks authority to regulate LDTs as medical devices. We cannot predict the likelihood of success of these or any other such actions,
nor can we quantify the effect of such efforts on our business. 

Revenue Recognition 

Clinical services derive revenues
from the performance of proprietary assays or tests. Our performance obligation is fulfilled upon completion, review and release of test
results to the customer, at which time we bill third-party payers or direct-bill payers for the tests performed. Under Accounting Standards
Codification 606, revenue is recognized based upon the estimated transaction price or net realizable value NRV ), which
is determined based on historical collection rates by each payer category for each proprietary test offered. To the extent that the transaction
price includes variable consideration, for all third party and direct-bill payers and proprietary tests, we estimate the amount of variable
consideration that should be included in the transaction price using the expected value method based on historical experience. 

The ultimate amounts received
from the third-party and direct-bill payers and related estimated reimbursement rates are regularly reviewed and we adjust the NRV s
and related contractual allowances accordingly. If actual collections and related NRV s vary significantly from our estimates, we
adjust the estimates of contractual allowances, which affects net revenue in the period such variances become known. 

Cost of Revenue 

Cost of revenue consists primarily
of the costs associated with operating our laboratory and other costs directly related to our tests. Personnel costs, which constitute
the largest portion of cost of services, include all labor-related costs, such as salaries, bonuses, fringe benefits and payroll taxes
for laboratory personnel. Other direct costs include, but are not limited to, laboratory supplies, certain consulting expenses, royalty
expenses, and facility expenses.

Revenue, net 

Revenue, net for the three months
ended September 30, 2024 increased by 3.2 million, or 35 , to 12.3 million, compared to 9.1 million for the three months ended September
30, 2023. The increase in net revenue was largely driven by increased test volumes as compared to the prior year. 

Cost of revenue 

Consolidated cost of revenue
for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 4.8 million, as compared to 4.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023.
As a percentage of revenue, cost of revenue decreased to 39 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 45 for the three months
ended September 30, 2023. This decrease was due to the increase in revenue mentioned above. 

Gross profit 

Consolidated gross profit
was approximately 7.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 5.0 million for the three months ended September
30, 2023. The gross profit percentage increased to 61 for the three months ended September 30, 3024 from 55 for the three months
ended September 30, 2023, respectively. This improvement was primarily due to the increase in revenue discussed above, which
resulted in fixed costs becoming a smaller percentage of cost of revenue which in turn improved the gross profit percentage. 

Sales and marketing expense 

Sales and marketing expense was
approximately 2.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023.
 The increase was primarily attributable to increased headcount and related employee costs. As
a percentage of revenue, sales and marketing expense was 23 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 28 for the
three months ended September 30, 2023. 

25 

Research and development 

Research and development expense
was approximately 0.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 0.1 million for the three months ended September 30,
2023. As a percentage of revenue, research and development expense was approximately 2 in both periods. 

General and administrative 

General and administrative expense
was approximately 2.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2.1 million for the three months ended September 30,
2023. The increase can be primarily attributed to an increase in employee costs and legal and professional
fees during the quarter. 

Acquisition amortization expense 

During
the three months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded amortization expense of approximately
 0.2 million, which was related to intangible assets associated with prior acquisitions. There was no amortization expense during the
three months ended September 30, 2024. 

Operating income (loss) 

Operating income from continuing
operations was 1.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to an operating loss from continuing operations
of 0.02 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in operating income from continuing operations was primarily
attributable to the increases in revenue and gross profit discussed above. 

Provision for income taxes 

Income tax expense was approximately
 4,000 for both the three months ended September 30, 2024 and the three months ended September 30, 2023. 

Loss from discontinued operations, net of tax 

We had a loss from discontinued
operations of approximately 0.1 million for both the three months ended September 30, 2024 and for the three months ended September 30,
2023, respectively.

Revenue, net 

Revenue, net for the nine months
ended September 30, 2024 increased by 4.7 million, or 16 , to 34.6 million, compared to 29.9 million for the nine months ended September
30, 2023. The increase in net revenue was largely driven by increased test volumes as compared to the prior year. 

Cost of revenue 

Consolidated cost of revenue
for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 13.6 million, as compared to 12.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.
As a percentage of revenue, cost of revenue was approximately 39 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 41 for
the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

Gross profit 

Consolidated gross profit was
approximately 21.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 17.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.
The gross profit percentage was approximately 61 for the nine months ended September 30, 3024 and 59 for the nine months ended September
30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to the increase in revenue discussed above. 

Sales and marketing expense 

Sales and marketing expense was
approximately 8.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 7.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.
The increase was primarily due to increased employee costs. As a percentage of revenue, sales and marketing expense was approximately
25 in both periods. 

27 

Research and development 

Research and development expense
was approximately 0.5 million for both the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. As a percentage
of revenue, research and development expense decreased to 1 from 2 in the comparable prior year period. 

General and administrative 

General and administrative expense
was approximately 6.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 7.5 million for the three months ended September 30,
2023. The decrease can be primarily attributed to a decrease in legal and related professional fees. 

Acquisition amortization expense 

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded amortization expense of approximately
 0.8 million, which was related to intangible assets associated with prior acquisitions. There was no amortization expense during the
nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

Operating income 

Operating income from continuing
operations was 5.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to operating income from continuing operations of
 1.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in operating income from continuing operations was primarily attributable
to the increase in revenue and gross profit discussed above. 

Provision for income taxes 

Income tax expense was approximately
 12,000 for both the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023. 

Loss from discontinued operations, net of tax 

We had a loss from discontinued
operations of approximately 0.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and a loss from discontinued operations of approximately
 0.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 

In addition to the United States
generally accepted accounting principles GAAP results provided throughout this document, we have provided certain non-GAAP
financial measures to help evaluate the results of our performance. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures, when presented
in conjunction with comparable GAAP financial measures, are useful to both management and investors in analyzing our ongoing business
and operating performance. We believe that providing the non-GAAP information to investors, in addition to the GAAP presentation, allows
investors to view our financial results in the way that management views financial results. 

In this Quarterly Report on Form
10-Q, we discuss Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure. Adjusted EBITDA is a metric used by management to measure cash flow of
the ongoing business. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as income or loss from continuing operations, plus depreciation and amortization, non-cash
stock based compensation, interest and taxes, and other non-cash expenses including change in fair value of notes payable and warrant
liability. The table below includes a reconciliation of this non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable GAAP financial
measure.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 

In October 2021, the Company
entered into a Loan and Security Agreement with BroadOak, providing for a term loan in the aggregate principal amount of 8,000,000 (the
 Term Loan ). Funding of the Term Loan took place on November 1, 2021. The Term Loan was scheduled to mature upon the earlier
of (i) October 31, 2024 or (ii) the occurrence of a change in control, and bears interest at the rate of 9 per annum. The Term Loan is
secured by a security interest in substantially all of the Company s and its subsidiaries assets and was subordinate to the
Company s former 7,500,000 revolving credit facility with Comerica Bank. The Term Loan has an origination fee of 3 of the Term
Loan amount, and a terminal payment equal to (i) 15 of the original principal amount of the Term Loan if the change of control occurs
on or prior to the first anniversary of the funding of the Term Loan, (ii) 20 of the original principal amount of the Term Loan if the
change of control occurs after the first anniversary but on or prior to the second anniversary of the funding of the Term Loan and (iii)
30 of the original principal amount of the Term Loan if the change of control occurs after the second anniversary of the funding of the
Term Loan, or if the Term Loan is repaid on its maturity date. Upon receipt of the term loan, the proceeds were used to repay in full
at their maturity the notes extended by Ampersand and 1315 Capital discussed above. See Note 13, Notes Payable, for more details.
In May 2022, the Company issued a Convertible Note to BroadOak, pursuant to which BroadOak funded a term loan in the aggregate principal
amount of 2.0 million which was converted into a subordinated term loan and was added to the outstanding balance of the Term Loan. See
Note 13, Notes Payable , for more details. 

On October 24, 2023, the Company
entered into a Second Amendment to the Loan and Security Agreement with BroadOak (the Second Amendment ). The primary changes
to the Term Loan were as follows: 

The Company made a one-time payment in an aggregate amount equal to 2,500,000, on October 30, 2023 and applied the payment in full satisfaction of the 3,000,000 Terminal Payment (as defined in the Term Loan). See Note 13, Notes Payable , regarding the Terminal Payment. 

Effective November 1, 2023, the interest rate under the Term Loan was reduced from 9 to 8 through the maturity date of October 31, 2024 or earlier, upon the occurrence of a change in control Loan Maturity Date ). 

The Company has the option to request an extension of the Loan Maturity Date in writing no less than sixty days prior to the Loan Maturity Date. If BroadOak agreed to the extension, the Loan Maturity Date would automatically be extended. 

29 

On March 29, 2024, the Company
entered into a Third Amendment to the Loan and Security Agreement with BroadOak (the Third Amendment ), extending the loan
maturity date to June 30, 2025. The primary changes to the Second Amendment were as follows: 

The maturity date was extended to June 30, 2025. 

Beginning April 1, 2024, the Company will make 500,000 monthly payments with the remaining loan balance due on the new maturity date. 

The Term Loan contains affirmative
and negative restrictive covenants, including restrictions on certain mergers, acquisitions, investments and encumbrances which could
adversely affect our ability to conduct our business. The Term Loan also contains customary events of default. The balance of the loan
at September 30, 2024 was 5.9 million. 

For the nine months ended September
30, 2024, we had operating income from continuing operations of 5.0 million. As of the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we had cash
and cash equivalents of 2.1 million, total current assets of 11.1 million and current liabilities of 18.8 million. As of November 1,
2024, we had approximately 1.8 million of cash and cash equivalents. 

During the nine months ended
September 30, 2024, net cash provided by operating activities was 3.5 million. The main component of cash provided by operating activities
was our net income of 3.8 million, partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable of 2.3 million. During
the nine months ended September 30, 2023, net cash provided by operating activities was 2.6 million. The main component of cash provided
by operating activities included non-cash expenses of 2.0 million. 

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash used in investing activities was approximately 0.7 million which pertained to upgrades
to the lab and the purchase of lab equipment. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, net cash provided by investing activities
was 0.1 million. 

For the nine months ended September
30, 2024, cash used in financing activities was 4.1 million, which were payments made on the BroadOak Term Loan. For the nine months
ended September 30, 2023, cash used in financing activities was 2.5 million, which were payments made on the Comerica Revolving Line
of Credit. 

We intend to meet our ongoing
capital needs by using our available cash generated from operations as well as through targeted margin improvement; collection of accounts
receivable; containment of costs; and the potential use of other financing options and other strategic alternatives. 

The Company continues to explore
various strategic alternatives, dilutive and non-dilutive sources of funding, including equity and debt financings, strategic alliances,
business development and other sources in order to provide additional liquidity. With the Company s delisting of its common stock
from Nasdaq in February 2021, our ability to raise additional capital on terms acceptable to the Company has been adversely impacted.
There can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in obtaining such funding on terms acceptable to the Company. 

On October 10, 2024, Ampersand
and 1315 Capital exchanged 47,000 shares of Series B Preferred Stock for 47,000 shares of Series C Preferred Stock (the Exchange ).
See Note 18, Subsequent Events . The Company believes that the 47,000 shares of Series C Preferred Stock will constitute stockholders 
equity under generally accepted accounting principles. The Exchange is the first significant step for the Company to seek an uplisting
of its common stock to Nasdaq. Other steps may need to be taken in order to satisfy Nasdaq listing requirements, including meeting Nasdaq s
stockholder equity and minimum bid price requirements. The Company believes that a Nasdaq listing would assist it in raising additional
capital, increasing investor interest and trading volume in its common stock, and pursuing acquisitions. No assurance
can be given that a Nasdaq listing will be achieved. 

30 

Further, along with many laboratories,
we may be affected by the Proposed LCD DL39365, which is currently under consideration by our local Medicare Administrative Contractor,
Novitas. If finalized, this Proposed LCD, which governs Genetic Testing for Oncology, could impact the existing Medicare
coverage for one of our molecular tests, PancraGEN . On June 5, 2023 we announced that Novitas issued the final LCD of
Genetic Testing for Oncology (L39365) which, if finalized, would have established non-coverage for the Company s widely used PancraGEN 
 test effective July 17, 2023. On July 6, 2023, Novitas announced that it would not be implementing the final Genetic Testing for
Oncology LCD (L39365) as scheduled on July 17, 2023. Novitas then issued a new virtually identical proposed LCD affecting the same companies
and tests and reaching the same conclusions as noted in the previously rescinded LCD on July 27, 2023. In response, the Company participated
in a public meeting presentation and submitted detailed written comments supporting the use of PancraGEN . The timing and
content of any final implemented LCD is uncertain at this time; the process could potentially take a year or longer from issuance of the
updated proposed LCD to reach a conclusion. On July 29, 2024 the Company announced that CMS granted Novitas an undefined extension to
the final decision for the LCD. As a result, we are able to continue offering PancraGEN and the related Point2 
fluid chemistry tests for amylase, CEA, and glucose. In the event Novitas ultimately restricts coverage for the PancraGEN 
test, the Company s liquidity could be negatively impacted. 

Inflation 

We do not believe that inflation
had a significant impact on our results of operations for the periods presented. However, inflation and supply chain disruptions, whether
caused by restrictions or slowdowns in shipping or logistics, increases in demand for certain goods used in our operations, or otherwise,
could impact our operations in the near term. 

Critical Accounting Policies 

See Note 5, Summary of Significant
Accounting Policies and Note 17, Recent Accounting Standards to the Interim Financial Statements included elsewhere in this
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for information regarding newly adopted and recent accounting pronouncements. See also Note 1, Nature
of Business and Significant Accounting Policies to our financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year
ended December 31, 2023, as amended, for a discussion of our critical accounting policies. There have been no material changes to such
critical accounting policies. We believe our most critical accounting policies include accounting for revenue recognition, leases, income taxes and stock-based compensation expense. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

None. 

Subsequent Event 

On October 10th, 2024, the Company, Ampersand and
1315 Capital (the Investors entered into an Exchange Agreement (the Exchange Agreement pursuant to which
the Investors exchanged an aggregate of 47,000 shares of the Company s existing Series B Preferred Stock of the Company comprised
of 28,000 shares of Series B Preferred Stock held by Ampersand and 19,000 shares of Series B Preferred Stock held by 1315 Capital, which
represented all of the Company s issued and outstanding Series B Preferred Stock, for 47,000 newly created shares of Series C Preferred
Stock, at an issuance price per share of 1,000. In the Exchange, Ampersand received 28,000 shares of Series C Preferred Stock and 1315
received 19,000 shares of Series C Preferred Stock. 

The Series C Preferred Stock is convertible into the
Company s common stock at a conversion price of 2.02 per share of common stock (subject to further adjustment in the event of any
stock dividend, stock split, combination, or other similar recapitalization affecting such shares) which was the closing price of the
common stock on the date of the Exchange Agreement. The Series C Preferred Stock does not have a liquidation preference over the common
stock in the event of a sale or dissolution of the Company, does not have director designation rights and includes limited customary protective
provisions. The Series B Preferred Stock had a conversion price of 6.00 per share of common stock and included additional protective
provisions not applicable to the Series C Preferred Stock, including (i) limitations on the Board of Directors of the Company to declare
dividends, (ii) director designation rights for each of the Investors, (iii) liquidation rights of holders upon deemed liquidation 
events, including a liquidation preference over the common stock, (iv) limitations on the ability to authorize, issue or create debt securities,
(v) limitations on the ability to enter into mergers or acquisitions and (vi) limitations on the ability to conduct public offerings of
the Company s common stock. The Series C Preferred Stock is convertible into 23,267,326 shares of common stock. 

31 

The closing of the transactions contemplated by the Exchange Agreement
occurred on October 11, 2024, following the satisfaction of customary conditions set forth in the Exchange Agreement and did not result
in the receipt of any cash proceeds by the Company. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures
About Market Risk 

As a smaller reporting company,
we are electing scaled disclosure reporting obligations and therefore are not required to provide the information requested by this Item. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Our principal executive officer
and principal financial officer evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. The term
 disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, means controls and
other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it
files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s
rules and forms. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable
assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of
possible controls and procedures. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to
ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated
and communicated to the company s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate,
to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Based
on management s evaluation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures, the principal executive officer and principal
financial officer of the Company identified a material weakness in the Company s internal control over financial reporting in the
quarterly period ended March 31, 2024 related to the timing of revenue recognition based on the Company s revenue recognition policy
and have concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2024 as a result
of such material weakness in the Company s internal control over financial reporting. 

The
Company has adopted a remediation plan, pursuant to which the Company plans to amend its internal controls to mitigate the material weakness,
which was identified by management, including by updating its procedures regarding the testing of revenue recognition, and reviewing the
procedures which ensure that revenue is recorded in the period in which it is earned. The Company believes implementation of these processes
and appropriate testing of their effectiveness will remediate the material weakness in the Company s internal control over financial
reporting. 

Changes in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting 

Other
than the material weakness and the adoption of the remediation plan discussed above, there has been no change in our internal control
over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter covered
by this report that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

of Class II, and if such fraction is two-thirds, one of the extra directors shall be a member of Class II and one of the extra
directors shall be a member of Class III, unless otherwise provided from time to time by resolution adopted by the Board of Directors.

as a director of the class of which he is a member and (ii) the newly created or eliminated directorships resulting from such
increase or decrease shall be apportioned among the three classes of directors so as to ensure that no one class has more than
one director more than any other class. To the extent possible, consistent with the foregoing rule, any newly created directorships
shall be added to those classes whose terms of office are to expire at the latest dates following such allocation, and any newly
eliminated directorships shall be subtracted from those classes whose terms of offices are to expire at the earliest dates following
such allocation, unless otherwise provided from time to time by resolution adopted by the Board of Directors. 

5.

Preferred Stock issued by the Corporation shall have the right to vote separately by class or series to elect directors at an
annual or special meeting of stockholders, the election, term of office, filling of vacancies and other features of such directorships
shall be governed by the terms of this Certificate of Incorporation applicable thereto, and such directors so elected shall not
be divided into classes provided by this Article Seventh, unless expressly provided by such terms.

his earlier death, resignation or removal.

the manner provided by the Bylaws of the Corporation.

of Directors exists, such committee may exercise any right or authority of the Board of Directors under this Certificate of Incorporation. 

10.

more than one class of stock no outstanding share of any class of stock which is denied voting power under the provisions of the
Certificate of Incorporation shall entitle the holder thereof to the right to vote at any meeting of stockholders except as the
provisions of paragraph (c)(2) of Section 242 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware shall otherwise require;
provided, that no share of any such class which is otherwise denied voting power shall entitle the holder thereof to vote upon
the increase or decrease in the number of authorized shares of said class. 

ELEVENTH:

for breach of fiduciary duty as a director, except for liability (i) for any breach of the director s duty of loyalty to
the Corporation or its stockholders, (ii) for acts or omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or a
knowing violation of law, (iii) under Section 174 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, or (iv) for any transaction from which
the director derived an improper personal benefit. 

TWELFTH:
 (a) Right to Indemnification . Each person who was or is made a party or is threatened to be made a party to or
is involved in any action, suit, claim or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (hereinafter a
 proceeding ), by reason of the fact that he or she, or a person of whom he or she is the legal representative,
is or was a director or officer, of the Corporation or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer,
employee or agent of another corporation or of a partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, including service with
respect to employee benefit plans, whether the basis of such proceeding is alleged action in an official capacity as a director,
officer, employee or agent or in any other capacity while serving as a director, officer, employee or agent, shall be indemnified
and held harmless by the Corporation to the fullest extent authorized by the Delaware General Corporation Law, as the same exists
or may hereafter be amended (but, in the case of any such amendment, only to the extent that such amendment permits the Corporation
to provide broader indemnification rights than said law permitted the Corporation to provide prior to such amendment), against
all expense, liability and loss (including attorneys fees, judgments, fines, ERISA excise taxes or penalties and amounts
paid or to be paid in settlement) reasonably incurred or suffered by such person in connection therewith and such indemnification
shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director, officer, employee or agent and shall inure to the benefit of his
or her heirs, executors and administrators: provided, however, that, except as provided in paragraph (b) hereof, the Corporation
shall indemnify any such person seeking indemnification in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such person
only if such proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized by the Board of Directors. The right to indemnification conferred in
this Section shall be a contract right and shall include the right to be paid by the Corporation the expenses incurred in defending
any such proceeding in advance of its final disposition: provided, however, that, if the Delaware General Corporation Law requires,
the payment of such expenses incurred by a director or officer (in his or her capacity as a director or officer and not in any
other capacity in which service was or is rendered by such person while a director or officer, including, without limitation,
service to an employee benefit plan) in advance of the final disposition of a proceeding, shall be made only upon delivery to
the Corporation of an undertaking, by or on behalf of such director or officer, to repay all amounts so advanced if it shall ultimately
be determined that such director or officer is not entitled to be indemnified under this Section or otherwise. The Corporation
may, by action of its Board of Directors, provide indemnification to employees and agents of the Corporation with the same scope
and effect as the foregoing indemnification of directors and officers mentioned in this Article Twelfth. Notwithstanding the indemnification
provisions throughout the Certificate of Incorporation, the Corporation, shall not be obligated, contractually or otherwise, to
indemnify its directors and officers with respect to proceedings initiated or brought by any officer or director and not by way
of defense, or, for any amounts paid in settlement of any proceeding against any officer or director, without the prior written
consent of the Company. 

(b)
 Right of Claimant to Bring Suit . If a claim under paragraph (a) of this Article is not paid in full by the Corporation
within thirty days after a written claim has been received by the Corporation, the claimant may at any time thereafter bring suit
against the Corporation to recover the unpaid amount of the claim and, if successful in whole or in part, the claimant shall be
entitled to be paid also the expense of prosecuting such claim. It shall be a defense to any such action (other than an action
brought to enforce a claim for expenses incurred in defending any proceeding in advance of its final disposition where the required
undertaking, if any is required, has been tendered to the Corporation) that the claimant has not met the standards of conduct
which make it permissible under the Delaware General Corporation Law for the Corporation to indemnify the claimant for the amount
claimed, but the burden of proving such defense shall be on the Corporation. Neither the failure of the Corporation (including
its Board of Directors, independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement
of such action that indemnification of the claimant is proper in the circumstances because he or she has met the applicable standard
of conduct set forth in the Delaware General Corporation Law, nor an actual determination by the Corporation (including its Board
of Directors, independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) that the claimant has not met such applicable standard or conduct,
shall be a defense to the action or create a presumption that the claimant has not met the applicable standard of conduct. 

(c)
 Non-Exclusivity of Rights . The right to indemnification and the payment of expenses incurred in defending a proceeding
in advance of its final disposition conferred in this Article shall not be exclusive of any other right which any person may have
or hereafter acquire under any statute, provision of the Certificate of Incorporation, Bylaws, agreement, vote of stockholders
or disinterested directors or otherwise. 

(d)
 Insurance . The Corporation may maintain insurance, at its expense, to protect itself and any director, officer, employee
or agent of the Corporation or another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any such expense,
liability or loss, whether or not the Corporation would have the power to indemnify such person against such expense, liability
or loss under the Delaware General Corporation Law. 

THIRTEENTH:
 From time to time any of the provisions of this Certificate of Incorporation may be amended, altered or repealed, and
other provisions authorized by the laws of the State of Delaware at the time in force may be added or inserted in the manner and
at the time prescribed by said laws, and all rights at any time conferred upon the stockholders of the Corporation by this Certificate
of Incorporation are granted subject to the provisions of this Article Thirteenth. 

FOURTEENTH:
 Meetings of the stockholders may be held within or without the State of Delaware, as the Bylaws, amendments thereto, or
amendments to this Certificate of Incorporation may provide. The books of the Corporation may be kept outside of the State of
Delaware at such place or places as may be designated from time to time by the Board of Directors or by the Bylaws, and amendments
thereto, or by the amendments to this Certificate of Incorporation. 

FIFTEENTH:
 At any time during which a class of capital stock of this Corporation is registered under Section 12 of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 or any similar successor statute, stockholders of this Corporation may not take any action by written consent
in lieu of a meeting. Notwithstanding any other provisions of law, this Certificate of Incorporation or the Bylaws of this Corporation,
and notwithstanding the fact that a lesser percentage may be specified by law, the affirmative vote of the holders of at least
seventy-five percent (75 of the shares of capital stock of this Corporation issued and outstanding and entitled to vote generally
in the election of directors shall be required to amend or repeal, or to adopt any provision inconsistent with, this Article Fifteenth.

in the notice of meeting. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Certificate of Incorporation or the Bylaws of the Corporation,
and notwithstanding the fact that a lesser percentage may be specified by law, the affirmative vote of the holders of at least

and one-half times (2 x) the Stated Value of such share of Series A-1 Preferred Stock; or (c) from and after the third

into Series A Preferred Stock pursuant to Section 7 immediately prior to such Liquidation and immediately thereafter and effective
prior to the consummation of such Liquidation each such share of Series A Preferred Stock had been converted to Common Stock pursuant
to Section 8 without regard to the Exchange Cap (the amount payable in respect of shares of Series A-1 Preferred Stock pursuant
to this sentence is hereinafter referred to as the Series A-1 Liquidation Amount ). If upon any such
Liquidation, the assets of the Corporation available for distribution to its stockholders shall be insufficient to pay the Holders
of shares of Series A-1 Preferred Stock and any series of Preferred Stock ranking on liquidation on a parity with the Series A-1
Preferred Stock the full amount to which they shall be entitled under this Section 5(a), the Holders of shares of Series A-1 Preferred
Stock and any series of Preferred Stock ranking on liquidation on a parity with the Series A-1 Preferred Stock shall share ratably
in any distribution of the assets available for distribution in proportion to the respective amounts which would otherwise be
payable in respect of the shares of Series A-1 Preferred Stock held by them upon such distribution if all amounts payable on or
with respect to such shares were paid in full. 

(b)
In the event of any Liquidation, the Holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock then outstanding shall be entitled to be paid
out of the assets of the Corporation available for distribution to its stockholders (on a pari passu basis with the holders of
any class or series of Preferred Stock ranking on liquidation on a parity with the Series A Preferred Stock), and before any payment
shall be made to the holders of Common Stock or any other class or series of Preferred Stock ranking on liquidation junior to
the Series A Preferred Stock by reason of their ownership thereof, an amount per share of Series A Preferred Stock equal to the
greater of (i) the Stated Value of such share of Series A Preferred Stock, plus any Series A Accruing Dividends accrued but unpaid
thereon, whether or not declared, together with any other dividends declared but unpaid thereon, or (ii) such amount per share
as would have been payable had each such share been converted into Common Stock pursuant to Section 8 immediately prior to such
Liquidation without regard to the Exchange Cap, (the amount payable in respect of shares of Series A Preferred Stock pursuant
to this sentence is hereinafter referred to as the Series A Liquidation Amount ). If upon any such

Stock the full amount to which they shall be entitled under this Section 5(b), the Holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock
and any series of Preferred Stock ranking on liquidation on a parity with the Series A Preferred Stock shall share ratably in
any distribution of the assets available for distribution in proportion to the respective amounts which would otherwise be payable
in respect of the shares held by them upon such distribution if all amounts payable on or with respect to such shares were paid

(c)
In the event of any Liquidation, after the payment of all preferential amounts required to be paid to the Holders of shares of
Series A-1 Preferred Stock, Series A Preferred Stock and any other series of Preferred Stock ranking on liquidation senior to
the Common Stock, the remaining assets of the Corporation available for distribution to its stockholders shall be distributed
among the holders of shares of Common Stock, pro rata based on the number of shares held by each such holder. 

(d)
The Corporation shall not have the power to effect a Deemed Liquidation unless the definitive agreement regarding such transaction
provides that the consideration payable to the stockholders of the Corporation shall be allocated among the holders of capital
stock of the Corporation in accordance with Section 5 of this Certificate of Designation. 

(e)
If following a Deemed Liquidation the Corporation does not effect a dissolution of the Corporation under the General Corporation
Law within sixty (60) days after such Deemed Liquidation, then (i) the Corporation shall send a written notice to each Holder
of Senior Preferred Stock no later than the sixtieth (60th) day after the Deemed Liquidation advising such Holders of their right
(and the requirements to be met to secure such right) pursuant to the terms of the following clause (ii) to require the redemption
of such shares of Senior Preferred Stock, and (ii) if the Holders of a majority of the then outstanding shares of Senior Preferred
Stock so request in a written instrument delivered to the Corporation not later than sixty (60) days after receipt of such notice,
the Corporation shall use the consideration received by the Corporation for such Deemed Liquidation (net of any retained liabilities
associated with the assets sold or technology licensed, as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors of the Corporation)
(the Net Proceeds ), to the extent legally available therefor, on the one hundred fiftieth (150th)
day after such Deemed Liquidation, to redeem all outstanding shares of Senior Preferred Stock at a price per share equal to the
Series A-1 Liquidation Value or Series A Liquidation Value, as applicable. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of a redemption
pursuant to the preceding sentence, if the Net Proceeds are not sufficient to redeem all outstanding shares of Senior Preferred
Stock and of any other series of Preferred Stock ranking on redemption on parity with the Senior Preferred Stock that is required
to then be redeemed, or if the Corporation does not have sufficient lawfully available funds to effect such redemption, the Corporation
shall first redeem a pro rata portion of each Holder s shares of Series A Preferred Stock and any such other series of Preferred
Stock ranking on redemption on a parity with the Series A Preferred Stock to the fullest extent of such Net Proceeds or such lawfully
available funds, as the case may be, based on the respective amounts which would otherwise be payable in respect of the shares
to be redeemed if the legally available funds were sufficient to redeem all such shares. If upon any such redemption, the assets
of the Corporation lawfully available to effect such redemption shall be insufficient to pay the Holders of shares of Series A
Preferred Stock and any series of Preferred Stock ranking on redemption on a parity with the Series A Preferred Stock, the full
amount to which they shall be entitled under this Section 5(e), the Holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock and any series
of Preferred Stock ranking on redemption on a parity with the Series A Preferred Stock shall share ratably in any distribution
of the assets lawfully available for such redemption in proportion to the respective amounts which would otherwise be payable
in respect of the shares held by them upon such redemption if all amounts payable on or with respect to such shares were paid
in full, and shall redeem the remaining shares to have been redeemed as soon as practicable after the Corporation has funds legally
available therefor. Thereafter, the Corporation shall next redeem a pro rata portion of each Holder s shares of Series A-1
Preferred Stock and any such other series of Preferred Stock ranking on redemption on parity with the Series A-1 Preferred Stock
to the fullest extent of such Net Proceeds or such lawfully available funds, as the case may be, based on the respective amounts
which would otherwise be payable in respect of the shares to be redeemed if the legally available funds were sufficient to redeem
all such shares. If upon any such redemption, the assets of the Corporation lawfully available to effect such redemption shall
be insufficient to pay the Holders of shares of Series A-1 Preferred Stock and any series of Preferred Stock ranking on redemption
on a parity with the Series A-1 Preferred Stock, the full amount to which they shall be entitled under this Section 5(e), the
Holders of shares of Series A-1 Preferred Stock and any series of Preferred Stock ranking on redemption on a parity with the Series
A-1 Preferred Stock shall share ratably in any distribution of the assets lawfully available for such redemption in proportion
to the respective amounts which would otherwise be payable in respect of the shares held by them upon such redemption if all amounts
payable on or with respect to such shares were paid in full, and shall redeem the remaining shares to have been redeemed as soon
as practicable after the Corporation has funds legally available therefor. The provisions of Section 6(b) below shall apply, with
such necessary changes in the details thereof as are necessitated by the context, to the redemption of the Senior Preferred Stock
pursuant to this Section 5(e). Prior to the distribution or redemption provided for in this Section 5(e), the Corporation shall
not expend or dissipate the consideration received for such Deemed Liquidation, except to discharge expenses incurred in connection
with such Deemed Liquidation or in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice. 

12 

(f)
The amount deemed paid or distributed to the holders of capital stock of the Corporation upon any Liquidation Event shall be the
cash or the value of the property, rights or securities paid or distributed to such holders by the Corporation or the acquiring
person, firm or other entity; provided , that the value of any such non-cash property, rights or securities shall be determined
in good faith by the Board of Directors of the Corporation. 

Section
6 . Redemption . 

(a)
If the Corporation shall have failed to obtain the Nasdaq Approval on, or prior to, the third (3rd) anniversary of the Issuance
Date (the Triggering Event Date ), each Holder shall have the right (the Redemption Right beginning on the date following the Triggering Event Date to require the Corporation to redeem all of the shares of Series A Preferred
Stock, if any, then held by such Holder that are convertible into a number of shares of Common Stock that exceeds the Exchange
Cap and all of the shares of Series A-1 Preferred Stock then held by such Holder by delivering written notice thereof to the Corporation
(the Redemption Notice together with the applicable certificates, if any, representing such shares
of Senior Preferred Stock which Redemption Notice shall indicate that Holder is electing to redeem such shares of Senior Preferred
Stock. Each of the shares of Senior Preferred Stock subject to redemption by the Corporation pursuant to this Section 6(a) shall
be redeemed by the Corporation at a price equal to the Series A-1 Liquidation Value or Series A Liquidation Value, as applicable.
Payment of the Series A-1 Liquidation Value or Series A Liquidation Value, as applicable, required by this Section 6(a) shall
be made in accordance with the provisions of Section 6(b). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 6(a), until
the Series A Liquidation Value for each share of Series A Preferred Stock subject to a Redemption Notice is paid in full, such
shares of Series A Preferred Stock that have not been so redeemed under this Section 6(a) may be converted, in whole or in part,
by Holder into Common Stock pursuant to Section 8; provided , that the Corporation shall not be obligated to pay Holder
the Series A Liquidation Value in respect of any shares of Senior Preferred Stock subject to a Redemption Notice that are so converted
into shares of Common Stock. 

(b)
If a Holder submits a Redemption Notice in accordance with Section 6(a), the Corporation shall pay such Holder an amount equal
to the aggregate Series A-1 Liquidation Value or Series A Liquidation Value, as applicable, payable in respect of all Senior Preferred
Stock held by such Holder to be redeemed pursuant to Section 6(a) by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account(s)
designated in the Redemption Notice as soon as reasonably practicable, but in no event later than sixty (60) days, following the
date of such Redemption Notice. Upon payment of the aggregate Series A-1 Liquidation Value or Series A Liquidation Value, as applicable,
in respect of any shares of Senior Preferred Stock subject to a Redemption Notice, such shares of Senior Preferred Stock will
be automatically cancelled without any further action on the part of the Corporation, Holder or any other Person and such cancelled
shares of Senior Preferred Stock shall no longer be issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation. In the
event that the Corporation does not pay to Holder any portion of the Series A-1 Liquidation Value or Series A Liquidation Value,
as applicable, in respect of shares of Senior Preferred Stock subject to a Redemption Notice in full within the time period required
for any reason (including, without limitation, to the extent such payment is prohibited pursuant to applicable law), at any time
thereafter and until the Corporation pays such Series A-1 Liquidation Value or Series A Liquidation Value, as applicable, in full,
such Holder shall have the option, in lieu of redemption, to require the Corporation to promptly return to such Holder all or
any of the shares of Senior Preferred Stock subject to a Redemption Notice that were submitted for redemption and for which the
applicable Series A-1 Liquidation Value or Series A Liquidation Value, as applicable, has not been paid. Upon the Corporation s
receipt of such notice, (A) the Redemption Notice shall be null and void with respect to such shares of Senior Preferred Stock,
and (B) the Corporation shall immediately return the applicable certificate, if any, or issue a new, to Holder (unless such shares
of Senior Preferred Stock are held in book-entry form, in which case the Corporation shall deliver evidence to such Holder that
a book-entry for such shares of Senior Preferred Stock then exists).

of the Holder thereof, into a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the product of the Series A Conversion Ratio and the number
of shares of Series A Preferred Stock to be converted. Holders shall effect conversions of Series A Preferred Stock into Common
Stock by providing the Corporation with the form of conversion notice attached hereto as Annex A (a Notice
of Conversion ), duly completed and executed. Provided the Corporation s transfer agent is participating in
the Depository Trust Corporation DTC Fast Automated Securities Transfer program, the Notice of Conversion

violating such rules, the Exchange Cap ), except that the Exchange Cap shall not apply in the event
that the Corporation obtains the approval of its stockholders as required by applicable Nasdaq Marketplace rules for issuances
of shares of Common Stock without regard to the Exchange Cap (the Nasdaq Approval ). Within six (6)
months following the Issuance Date, the Corporation shall call a meeting (the date that such meeting is completed, the Next
Meeting Date of the Corporation s stockholders for the purpose of soliciting the Nasdaq Approval for the
issuance of the full amount of shares of Common Stock issuable upon the conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock, including
the Series A Preferred Stock issuable upon conversion of the Series A-1 Preferred Stock, authorized and designated under this

(i)
 Delivery of Certificate or Electronic Issuance Upon Conversion . Not later than three (3) Trading Days after the applicable
Conversion Date (the Share Delivery Date ), the Corporation shall (a) deliver, or cause to be delivered,
to the converting Holder or recipient of the Conversion Shares a physical certificate or certificates representing the number
of Conversion Shares set forth in a Notice of Conversion being acquired upon the conversion of shares of Series A Preferred Stock,
or (b) in the case of a DWAC Delivery (if so requested by the Holder), electronically transfer such Conversion Shares by crediting
the DTC participant account nominated by the Holder through DTC s DWAC system. If in the case of any Notice of Conversion
such certificate or certificates are not delivered to or as directed by or, in the case of a DWAC Delivery, such shares are not
electronically delivered to or as directed by, the applicable Holder by the Share Delivery Date, the applicable Holder shall be
entitled to elect to rescind such Conversion Notice by written notice to the Corporation at any time on or before its receipt
of such certificate or certificates for Conversion Shares or electronic receipt of such shares, as applicable, in which event
the Corporation shall promptly return to such Holder any original Series A Preferred Stock certificate delivered to the Corporation
and such Holder shall promptly return to the Corporation any Common Stock certificates or otherwise direct the return of any shares
of Common Stock delivered to the Holder through the DWAC system, representing the shares of Series A Preferred Stock unsuccessfully
tendered for conversion to the Corporation. 

(ii)
 Obligation Absolute . Subject to Section 8(c) hereof and subject to Holder s right to rescind a Conversion Notice
pursuant to Section 8(d)(i) above, the Corporation s obligation to issue and deliver the Conversion Shares upon conversion
of Series A Preferred Stock in accordance with the terms hereof are absolute and unconditional, irrespective of any action or
inaction by a Holder to enforce the same, any waiver or consent with respect to any provision hereof, the recovery of any judgment
against any Person or any action to enforce the same, or any setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, limitation or termination, or any
breach or alleged breach by such Holder or any other Person of any obligation to the Corporation or any violation or alleged violation
of law by such Holder or any other Person, and irrespective of any other circumstance which might otherwise limit such obligation
of the Corporation to such Holder in connection with the issuance of such Conversion Shares. Nothing herein shall limit a Holder s
right to pursue actual damages for the Corporation s failure to deliver Conversion Shares within the period specified herein
and such Holder shall have the right to pursue all remedies available to it hereunder, at law or in equity including, without
limitation, a decree of specific performance and/or injunctive relief; provided that Holder shall not receive duplicate damages
for the Corporation s failure to deliver Conversion Shares within the period specified herein. The exercise of any such
rights shall not prohibit a Holder from seeking to enforce damages pursuant to any other Section hereof or under applicable law. 

16 

(iii)
 Compensation for Buy-In on Failure to Timely Deliver Certificates Upon Conversion . If the Corporation fails to deliver
to a Holder (or its transferee) the applicable certificate or certificates or to effect a DWAC Delivery, as applicable, in each
case that represent shares of Common Stock by the Share Delivery Date pursuant to Section 8(d)(i) (other than a failure caused
by incorrect or incomplete information provided by Holder to the Corporation), and if after such Share Delivery Date such Holder
is required to or otherwise purchases (in an open market transaction or otherwise), shares of Common Stock to deliver in satisfaction
of a sale by such Holder of the Conversion Shares which such Holder was entitled to receive upon the conversion relating to such
Share Delivery Date (a Buy-In ), then the Corporation shall (A) pay in cash to such Holder (in addition
to any other remedies available to or elected by such Holder) the amount by which (x) such Holder s total purchase price
(including any brokerage commissions) for the shares of Common Stock so purchased exceeds (y) the product of (1) the aggregate
number of shares of Common Stock that such Holder was entitled to receive from the conversion at issue multiplied by (2) the actual
sale price at which the sell order giving rise to such purchase obligation was executed (including any brokerage commissions)
and (B) at the option of such Holder, either reissue (if surrendered) the shares of Series A Preferred Stock equal to the number
of shares of Series A Preferred Stock submitted for conversion or deliver to such Holder the number of shares of Common Stock
that would have been issued if the Corporation had timely complied with its delivery requirements under Section 8(d)(i). For example,
if a Holder purchases shares of Common Stock having a total purchase price of 11,000 to cover a Buy-In with respect to an attempted
conversion of shares of Series A Preferred Stock with respect to which the actual sale price (including any brokerage commissions)
giving rise to such purchase obligation was a total of 10,000 under clause (A) of the immediately preceding sentence, the Corporation
shall be required to pay such Holder 1,000. The Holder shall provide the Corporation written notice, within three (3) Trading
Days after the occurrence of a Buy-In, indicating the amounts payable to such Holder in respect of such Buy-In together with applicable
confirmations and other evidence reasonably requested by the Corporation. Nothing herein shall limit a Holder s right to
pursue any other remedies available to it hereunder, at law or in equity including, without limitation, a decree of specific performance
and/or injunctive relief with respect to the Corporation s failure to timely deliver certificates representing shares of
Common Stock upon conversion of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock as required pursuant to the terms hereof; provided, however,
that the Holder shall not be entitled to both (i) require the reissuance of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock submitted for
conversion for which such conversion was not timely honored and (ii) receive the number of shares of Common Stock that would have
been issued if the Corporation had timely complied with its delivery requirements under Section 8(d)(i). 

(iv)
Not later than two (2) Business Days after the Nasdaq Approval Date, the Corporation shall issue to each Holder the number of
shares of Series A Preferred Stock being acquired upon the conversion of shares of Series A-1 Preferred Stock held by such Holder
pursuant to Section 7(a) solely in book-entry form or, if requested by any Holder, such shares may be issued in certificated form. 

17 

(e)
 Reservation of Shares Issuable Upon Conversion . The Corporation covenants that it will, at all times reserve and keep available
out of its authorized and unissued shares of Series A Preferred Stock for the sole purpose of issuance upon conversion of the
Series A-1 Preferred Stock, free from preemptive rights or any other actual contingent purchase rights of Persons other than the
Holders of the Series A-1 Preferred Stock, not less than such aggregate number of shares of the Series A Preferred Stock as shall
be issuable upon the conversion of all outstanding shares of Series A-1 Preferred Stock. The Corporation covenants that all shares
of Series A Preferred Stock that shall be so issuable shall, upon issue, be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid, non-assessable
and free and clear of all liens and other encumbrances. The Corporation covenants that it will, at all times reserve and keep
available out of its authorized and unissued shares of Common Stock for the sole purpose of issuance upon conversion of the Series
A Preferred Stock, including all shares of Series A Preferred Stock issuable upon conversion of shares of Series A-1 Preferred
Stock, free from preemptive rights or any other actual contingent purchase rights of Persons other than the Holders of the Series
A Preferred Stock, not less than such aggregate number of shares of the Common Stock as shall be issuable (taking into account
the adjustments of Section 9) upon the conversion of all outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock, including all shares
of Series A Preferred Stock issuable upon conversion of shares of Series A-1 Preferred Stock. The Corporation covenants that all
shares of Common Stock that shall be so issuable shall, upon issue, be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid, non-assessable
and free and clear of all liens and other encumbrances. 

(f)
 Fractional Shares No fractional shares or scrip representing fractional shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall be issued
upon the conversion of the Series A-1 Preferred Stock. As to any fraction of a share of Series A Preferred Stock which a Holder
would otherwise be entitled to receive upon such conversion, the Corporation shall pay a cash adjustment in respect of such final
fraction in an amount equal to such fraction multiplied by the Stated Value. No fractional shares or scrip representing fractional
shares of Common Stock shall be issued upon the conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock. As to any fraction of a share of Common
Stock which a Holder would otherwise be entitled to receive upon such conversion, the Corporation shall pay a cash adjustment
in respect of such final fraction in an amount equal to such fraction multiplied by the Series A Conversion Price. 

(g)
 Transfer Taxes . The issuance of certificates (or book entry notations) for shares of Series A Preferred Stock upon conversion
of the Series A-1 Preferred Stock and the issuance of certificates (or book entry notations) for shares of the Common Stock upon
conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock, in each case, shall be made without charge to any Holder for any documentary stamp
or similar taxes that may be payable in respect of the issue or delivery of such certificates (or such book entry notation), provided
that the Corporation shall not be required to pay any tax that may be payable in respect of any transfer involved in the issuance
and delivery of any such certificate (or such book entry notation) upon conversion in a name other than that of the registered
Holder(s) of such shares of Series A-1 Preferred Stock or Series A Preferred Stock, as applicable, and the Corporation shall not
be required to issue or deliver such certificates (or such book entry notation) unless or until the Person or Persons requesting
the issuance thereof shall have paid to the Corporation the amount of such tax or shall have established to the satisfaction of
the Corporation that such tax has been paid. 

18 

(h)
 Status as Stockholder . Upon each Conversion Date and Mandatory Conversion Date: (i) the shares of Series A Preferred Stock
being converted shall be deemed converted into shares of Common Stock; and (ii) the Holder s rights as a holder of such
converted shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall cease and terminate, excepting only the right to receive certificates (or book
entry notations) for such shares of Common Stock and to any remedies provided herein or otherwise available at law or in equity
to such Holder because of a failure by the Corporation to comply with the terms of this Certificate of Designation. In all cases,
the Holder shall retain all of its rights and remedies for the Corporation s failure to convert Series A Preferred Stock.
From and after the Nasdaq Approval Date: (i) the shares of Series A-1 Preferred Stock shall be deemed converted into shares of
Series A Preferred Stock; and (ii) the Holder s rights as a Holder of such converted shares of Series A-1 Preferred Stock
shall cease and terminate, excepting only the right to receive certificates (or book entry notations) for such shares of Series
A Preferred Stock and to any remedies provided herein or otherwise available at law or in equity to such Holder because of a failure
by the Corporation to comply with the terms of this Certificate of Designation. In all cases, the Holder shall retain all of its
rights and remedies for the Corporation s failure to convert Series A-1 Preferred Stock. 

Section
9 . Certain Adjustments . 

(a)
 Stock Dividends and Stock Splits . If the Corporation, at any time while any shares of Series A Preferred Stock are outstanding:
(i) pays a stock dividend or otherwise makes a distribution or distributions payable in shares of Common Stock with respect to
the then outstanding shares of Common Stock; (ii) subdivides outstanding shares of Common Stock into a larger number of shares;
or (iii) combines (including by way of a reverse stock split) outstanding shares of Common Stock into a smaller number of shares,
then the Series A Conversion Price shall be multiplied by a fraction of which the numerator shall be the number of shares of Common
Stock (excluding any treasury shares of the Corporation) outstanding immediately before such event and of which the denominator
shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event (excluding any treasury shares of the Corporation).
Any adjustment made pursuant to this Section 9(a) shall become effective immediately after the record date for the determination
of stockholders entitled to receive such dividend or distribution and shall become effective immediately after the effective date
in the case of a subdivision or combination. 

(b)
 Adjustments for Other Dividends and Distributions . In the event the Corporation at any time or from time to time after
the Issuance Date shall make or issue, or fix a record date for the determination of holders of Common Stock entitled to receive,
a dividend or other distribution payable in securities of the Corporation (other than a distribution of shares of Common Stock
in respect of outstanding shares of Common Stock) or in other property and the provisions of Section 3 do not apply to such dividend
or distribution, then and in each such event the Holders of Senior Preferred Stock shall receive, simultaneously with the distribution
to the holders of Common Stock, a dividend or other distribution of such securities or other property in an amount equal to the
amount of such securities or other property as they would have received if all outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock,
including if all shares of Series A-1 Preferred Stock shall have been converted to Series A Preferred Stock, had been converted
into Common Stock on the date of such event. 

19 

(c)
 Adjustment for Merger or Reorganization, etc . Subject to the provisions of Section 5, if there shall occur any reorganization,
recapitalization, reclassification, consolidation or merger involving the Corporation in which the Common Stock (but not the Series
A Preferred Stock) is converted into or exchanged for securities, cash or other property (other than a transaction covered by
Section 9(a), Section 9(b), Section 9(e) or Section 9(f)), then, following any such reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification,
consolidation or merger, each share of Series A Preferred Stock shall thereafter be convertible in lieu of the Common Stock into
which it was convertible prior to such event into the kind and amount of securities, cash or other property which a holder of
the number of shares of Common Stock of the Corporation issuable upon conversion of one share of Series A Preferred Stock immediately
prior to such reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, consolidation or merger would have been entitled to receive
pursuant to such transaction; and, in such case, appropriate adjustment (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors
of the Corporation) shall be made in the application of the provisions in this Certificate of Designation with respect to the
rights and interests thereafter of the Holders of the Series A Preferred Stock, to the end that the provisions set forth in this
Certificate of Designation (including provisions with respect to changes in and other adjustments of the Series A Conversion Price)
shall thereafter be applicable, as nearly as reasonably may be, in relation to any securities or other property thereafter deliverable
upon the conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock. 

(d)
 No Adjustment of Series A Conversion Price . No adjustment in the Series A Conversion Price shall be made as the result
of the issuance or deemed issuance of Additional Shares of Common Stock if the Corporation receives written notice from the Holders
representing a majority of the Senior Preferred Stock (voting as a single class) then-outstanding agreeing that no such adjustment
shall be made as the result of the issuance or deemed issuance of such Additional Shares of Common Stock. 

(e)
 Deemed Issue of Additional Shares of Common Stock .

(excluding Options or Convertible Securities which are themselves Exempted Securities) or shall fix a record date for the determination
of holders of any class of securities entitled to receive any such Options or Convertible Securities, then the maximum number
of shares of Common Stock (as set forth in the instrument relating thereto, assuming the satisfaction of any conditions to exercisability,
convertibility or exchangeability but without regard to any provision contained therein for a subsequent adjustment of such number)
issuable upon the exercise of such Options or, in the case of Convertible Securities and Options therefor, the conversion or exchange
of such Convertible Securities, shall be deemed to be Additional Shares of Common Stock issued as of the time of such issue or,
in case such a record date shall have been fixed, as of the close of business on such record date. 

20 

(ii)
If the terms of any Option or Convertible Security, the issuance of which resulted in an adjustment to the Series A Conversion
Price pursuant to the terms of Section 9(f), are revised as a result of an amendment to such terms or any other adjustment pursuant
to the provisions of such Option or Convertible Security (but excluding automatic adjustments to such terms pursuant to anti-dilution
or similar provisions of such Option or Convertible Security pursuant to which an adjustment has already been made under this
Section 9(e)) to provide for either (1) any increase or decrease in the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise,
conversion and/or exchange of any such Option or Convertible Security or (2) any increase or decrease in the consideration payable
to the Corporation upon such exercise, conversion and/or exchange, then, effective upon such increase or decrease becoming effective,
the Series A Conversion Price computed upon the original issue of such Option or Convertible Security (or upon the occurrence
of a record date with respect thereto) shall be readjusted to such Series A Conversion Price as would have obtained had such revised
terms been in effect upon the original date of issuance of such Option or Convertible Security. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
no readjustment pursuant to this Section 9(e)(ii) shall have the effect of increasing the Series A Conversion Price to an amount
which exceeds the lower of (i) the Series A Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to the original adjustment made as a
result of the issuance of such Option or Convertible Security, or (ii) the Series A Conversion Price that would have resulted
from any issuances of Additional Shares of Common Stock (other than deemed issuances of Additional Shares of Common Stock as a
result of the issuance of such Option or Convertible Security) between the original adjustment date and such readjustment date. 

(iii)
If the terms of any Option or Convertible Security (excluding Options or Convertible Securities which are themselves Exempted
Securities), the issuance of which did not result in an adjustment to the Series A Conversion Price pursuant to the terms of Section
9(f) (either because the consideration per share (determined pursuant to Section 9(g)) of the Additional Shares of Common Stock
subject thereto was equal to or greater than the Series A Conversion Price then in effect, or because such Option or Convertible
Security was issued before the Issuance Date), are revised after the Issuance Date as a result of an amendment to such terms or
any other adjustment pursuant to the provisions of such Option or Convertible Security (but excluding automatic adjustments to
such terms pursuant to anti-dilution or similar provisions of such Option or Convertible Security pursuant to which an adjustment
has already been made under this Section 9(e)) to provide for either (1) any increase in the number of shares of Common Stock
issuable upon the exercise, conversion or exchange of any such Option or Convertible Security or (2) any decrease in the consideration
payable to the Corporation upon such exercise, conversion or exchange, then such Option or Convertible Security, as so amended
or adjusted, and the Additional Shares of Common Stock subject thereto (determined in the manner provided in Section 9(e)(ii))
shall be deemed to have been issued effective upon such increase or decrease becoming effective. 

(iv)
Upon the expiration or termination of any unexercised Option or unconverted or unexchanged Convertible Security (or portion thereof)
which resulted (either upon its original issuance or upon a revision of its terms) in an adjustment to the Series A Conversion
Price pursuant to the terms of Section 9(f), the Series A Conversion Price shall be readjusted to such Series A Conversion Price
as would have obtained had such Option or Convertible Security (or portion thereof) never been issued. 

21 

(v)
If the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise, conversion and/or exchange of any Option or Convertible Security,
or the consideration payable to the Corporation upon such exercise, conversion and/or exchange, is calculable at the time such
Option or Convertible Security is issued or amended but is subject to adjustment based upon subsequent events, any adjustment
to the Series A Conversion Price provided for in this Section 9(e) shall be effected at the time of such issuance or amendment
based on such number of shares or amount of consideration without regard to any provisions for subsequent adjustments (and any
subsequent adjustments shall be treated as provided in clauses (ii) and (iii) of this Section 9(e)). If the number of shares of
Common Stock issuable upon the exercise, conversion and/or exchange of any Option or Convertible Security, or the consideration
payable to the Corporation upon such exercise, conversion and/or exchange, cannot be calculated at all at the time such Option
or Convertible Security is issued or amended, any adjustment to the Series A Conversion Price that would result under the terms
of this Section 9(e) at the time of such issuance or amendment shall instead be effected at the time such number of shares and/or
amount of consideration is first calculable (even if subject to subsequent adjustments), assuming for purposes of calculating
such adjustment to the Series A Conversion Price that such issuance or amendment took place at the time such calculation can first
be made. 

(f)
 Adjustment of Series A Conversion Price Upon Issuance of Additional Shares of Common Stock . In the event the Corporation
shall at any time after the Issuance Date issue Additional Shares of Common Stock (including Additional Shares of Common Stock
deemed to be issued pursuant to Section 9(e)), without consideration or for a consideration per share less than the Series A Conversion
Price in effect immediately prior to such issuance or deemed issuance, then the Series A Conversion Price shall be reduced, concurrently
with such issue, to a price (calculated to the nearest one-hundredth of a cent) determined in accordance with the following formula: 

CP2
= CP1 (A + B) (A + C). 

For
purposes of the foregoing formula, the following definitions shall apply: 

CP2 
shall mean the Series A Conversion Price in effect immediately after such issuance or deemed issuance of Additional Shares of
Common Stock. 

CP1 
shall mean the Series A Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to such issuance or deemed issuance of Additional Shares
of Common Stock;

the Series A Preferred Stock into Common Stock, including the shares of Series A-1 Preferred Stock into Series A Preferred Stock)
outstanding (assuming exercise of any outstanding Options therefor) immediately prior to such issue); 

B 
shall mean the number of shares of Common Stock that would have been issued if such Additional Shares of Common Stock had been
issued or deemed issued at a price per share equal to CP1 (determined by dividing the aggregate consideration received by the
Corporation in respect of such issue by CP1); and 

22 

C 
shall mean the number of such Additional Shares of Common Stock issued in such transaction. 

(g)
 Determination of Consideration . For purposes of this Certificate of Designation, the consideration received by the Corporation
for the issuance or deemed issuance of any Additional Shares of Common Stock shall be computed as follows: (i) such consideration
shall: (A) insofar as it consists of cash, be computed at the aggregate amount of cash received by the Corporation, excluding
amounts paid or payable for accrued interest; (B) insofar as it consists of property other than cash, be computed at the fair
market value thereof at the time of such issue, as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors of the Corporation; and
(C) in the event Additional Shares of Common Stock are issued together with other shares or securities or other assets of the
Corporation for consideration which covers both, be the proportion of such consideration so received, computed as provided in
clauses (A) and (B) above, as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors of the Corporation. 

(h)
 Options and Convertible Securities . The consideration per share received by the Corporation for Additional Shares of Common
Stock deemed to have been issued pursuant to Section 9(e), relating to Options and Convertible Securities, shall be determined
by dividing: (i) the total amount, if any, received or receivable by the Corporation as consideration for the issue of such Options
or Convertible Securities, plus the minimum aggregate amount of additional consideration (as set forth in the instruments relating
thereto, without regard to any provision contained therein for a subsequent adjustment of such consideration) payable to the Corporation
upon the exercise of such Options or the conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities, or in the case of Options for
Convertible Securities, the exercise of such Options for Convertible Securities and the conversion or exchange of such Convertible
Securities, by (ii) the maximum number of shares of Common Stock (as set forth in the instruments relating thereto, without regard
to any provision contained therein for a subsequent adjustment of such number) issuable upon the exercise of such Options or the
conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities, or in the case of Options for Convertible Securities, the exercise of such
Options for Convertible Securities and the conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities. 

(i)
 Multiple Closing Dates . In the event the Corporation shall issue on more than one date Additional Shares of Common Stock
that are a part of one transaction or a series of related transactions and that would result in an adjustment to the Series A
Conversion Price pursuant to the terms of Section 9(f), then, upon the final such issuance, the Series A Conversion Price shall
be readjusted to give effect to all such issuances as if they occurred on the date of the first such issuance (and without giving
effect to any additional adjustments as a result of any such subsequent issuances within such period). 

(j)
 Calculations . All calculations under this Certificate of Designation shall be made to the nearest cent or the nearest 1/100th
of a share, as the case may be. For purposes of this Section 9, the number of shares of Common Stock deemed to be issued and outstanding
as of a given date shall be the sum of the number of shares of Common Stock (excluding any treasury shares of the Corporation)
issued and outstanding. 

23 

(k)
 Notice to the Holders .

Stock, (B) the Corporation shall declare a special nonrecurring cash dividend on or a redemption of the Common Stock, (C) the

any Liquidation, or any compulsory share exchange whereby the Common Stock is converted into other securities, cash or property,
or (E) consent of the Holders of Senior Preferred Stock is required pursuant to Section 4(d) or Section 4(e), then, in each case,
the Corporation shall cause to be filed at each office or agency maintained for the purpose of conversion of the shares of Series
A Preferred Stock, and shall cause to be delivered to each Holder at its last address as it shall appear upon the stock books
of the Corporation, at least ten (10) calendar days prior to the applicable record or effective date hereinafter specified, a

to such dividend, distributions, redemption, rights or warrants are to be determined or (y) the date on which such reclassification,
consolidation, merger, sale, transfer, Liquidation or share exchange is expected to become effective or close, and the date as
of which it is expected that holders of the Common Stock of record shall be entitled to exchange their shares of the Common Stock
for securities, cash or other property deliverable upon such reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale, transfer or share
exchange, provided that the failure to deliver such notice or any defect therein or in the delivery thereof shall not affect the
validity of the corporate action required to be specified in such notice. 

Section
10 . Miscellaneous . 

(a)
 Lost or Mutilated Stock Certificates . If a Holder s certificate representing shares of Series A Preferred Stock or
Series A-1 Preferred Stock, if applicable, shall be mutilated, lost, stolen or destroyed, the Corporation shall execute and deliver,
if requested by the Holder, in exchange and substitution for and upon cancellation of a mutilated certificate, or in lieu of or
in substitution for a lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, a new certificate for the shares of Series A Preferred Stock or Series

Corporation may prescribe, without the requirement to post a bond. 

24 

(b)
 Waiver . Any waiver by the Corporation or a Holder of a breach of any provision of this Certificate of Designation shall
not operate as or be construed to be a waiver of any other breach of such provision or of any breach of any other provision of
this Certificate of Designation or a waiver by any other Holders. The failure of the Corporation or a Holder to insist upon strict
adherence to any term of this Certificate of Designation on one or more occasions shall not be considered a waiver or deprive
that party (or any other Holder) of the right thereafter to insist upon strict adherence to that term or any other term of this
Certificate of Designation. Any waiver by the Corporation or a Holder must be in writing. Notwithstanding any provision in this
Certificate of Designation to the contrary, any provision contained herein and any right of the Holders of Senior Preferred Stock
granted hereunder may be waived as to all shares of Senior Preferred Stock (and the Holders thereof) upon the written consent
of the Holders of a majority of the shares of Senior Preferred Stock (voting as a single class) then outstanding, unless a higher
percentage is required by the DGCL, in which case the written consent of the Holders of not less than such higher percentage shall
be required. 

(c)
 Severability . If any provision of this Certificate of Designation is invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the balance of
this Certificate of Designation shall remain in effect, and if any provision is inapplicable to any Person or circumstance, it
shall nevertheless remain applicable to all other Persons and circumstances. If it shall be found that any interest or other amount
deemed interest due hereunder violates the applicable law governing usury, the applicable rate of interest due hereunder shall
automatically be lowered to equal the maximum rate of interest permitted under applicable law. 

(d)
 Next Business Day . Whenever any payment or other obligation hereunder shall be due on a day other than a Business Day,
such payment shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day. 

(e)
 Headings . The headings contained herein are for convenience only, do not constitute a part of this Certificate of Designation
and shall not be deemed to limit or affect any of the provisions hereof. 

(f)

Corporation, such shares shall resume the status of authorized but unissued shares of preferred stock and shall no longer be designated
as Series A Preferred Stock or Series A-1 Preferred Stock, as applicable.

Section
5 . Liquidation . 

(a)
In the event of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation or Deemed Liquidation (a
 Liquidation ), the Holders of shares of Series B Preferred Stock then outstanding shall be entitled
to be paid out of the assets of the Corporation available for distribution to its stockholders (on a pari passu basis with the
holders of any class or series of Preferred Stock ranking on liquidation on a parity with the Series B Preferred Stock), and before
any payment shall be made to the holders of Common Stock or any other class or series of Preferred Stock ranking on liquidation
junior to the Series B Preferred Stock by reason of their ownership thereof, an amount per share of Series B Preferred Stock equal
to the greater of (i) the Stated Value of such share of Series B Preferred Stock, plus any dividends declared but unpaid thereon,
or (ii) such amount per share as would have been payable had each such share been converted into Common Stock pursuant to Section
6 immediately prior to such Liquidation, (the amount payable in respect of shares of Series B Preferred Stock pursuant to this
sentence is hereinafter referred to as the Series B Liquidation Amount ). If upon any such Liquidation,
the assets of the Corporation available for distribution to its stockholders shall be insufficient to pay the Holders of shares
of Series B Preferred Stock and any series of Preferred Stock ranking on liquidation on a parity with the Series B Preferred Stock
the full amount to which they shall be entitled under this Section 5(a), the Holders of shares of Series B Preferred Stock and
any series of Preferred Stock ranking on liquidation on a parity with the Series B Preferred Stock shall share ratably in any
distribution of the assets available for distribution in proportion to the respective amounts which would otherwise be payable
in respect of the shares held by them upon such distribution if all amounts payable on or with respect to such shares were paid
in full. 

(b)
In the event of any Liquidation, after the payment of all preferential amounts required to be paid to the Holders of shares of
Series B Preferred Stock and any other series of Preferred Stock ranking on liquidation senior to the Common Stock, the remaining
assets of the Corporation available for distribution to its stockholders shall be distributed among the holders of shares of Common
Stock, pro rata based on the number of shares held by each such holder. 

(c)
The Corporation shall not have the power to effect a Deemed Liquidation unless the definitive agreement regarding such transaction
provides that the consideration payable to the stockholders of the Corporation shall be allocated among the holders of capital
stock of the Corporation in accordance with Section 5 of this Certificate of Designation. 

8 

(d)
If following a Deemed Liquidation the Corporation does not effect a dissolution of the Corporation under the General Corporation
Law within sixty (60) days after such Deemed Liquidation, then (i) the Corporation shall send a written notice to each Holder
of Series B Preferred Stock no later than the sixtieth (60th) day after the Deemed Liquidation advising such Holders of their
right (and the requirements to be met to secure such right) pursuant to the terms of the following clause (ii) to require the
redemption of such shares of Series B Preferred Stock, and (ii) if the Holders of at least seventy-five percent (75 of the then
outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock so request in a written instrument delivered to the Corporation not later than
sixty (60) days after receipt of such notice, the Corporation shall use the consideration received by the Corporation for such
Deemed Liquidation (net of any retained liabilities associated with the assets sold or technology licensed, as determined in good
faith by the Board of Directors of the Corporation) (the Net Proceeds ), to the extent legally available
therefor, on the one hundred fiftieth (150th) day after such Deemed Liquidation, to redeem all outstanding shares of Series B
Preferred Stock at a price per share equal to the Series B Liquidation Value. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of a
redemption pursuant to the preceding sentence, if the Net Proceeds are not sufficient to redeem all outstanding shares of Series
B Preferred Stock and of any other series of Preferred Stock ranking on redemption on parity with the Series B Preferred Stock
that is required to then be redeemed, or if the Corporation does not have sufficient lawfully available funds to effect such redemption,
the Corporation shall first redeem a pro rata portion of each Holder s shares of Series B Preferred Stock and any such other
series of Preferred Stock ranking on redemption on a parity with the Series B Preferred Stock to the fullest extent of such Net
Proceeds or such lawfully available funds, as the case may be, based on the respective amounts which would otherwise be payable
in respect of the shares to be redeemed if the legally available funds were sufficient to redeem all such shares. If upon any
such redemption, the assets of the Corporation lawfully available to effect such redemption shall be insufficient to pay the Holders
of shares of Series B Preferred Stock and any series of Preferred Stock ranking on redemption on a parity with the Series B Preferred
Stock, the full amount to which they shall be entitled under this Section 5(d), the Holders of shares of Series B Preferred Stock
and any series of Preferred Stock ranking on redemption on a parity with the Series B Preferred Stock shall share ratably in any
distribution of the assets lawfully available for such redemption in proportion to the respective amounts which would otherwise
be payable in respect of the shares held by them upon such redemption if all amounts payable on or with respect to such shares
were paid in full, and shall redeem the remaining shares to have been redeemed as soon as practicable after the Corporation has
funds legally available therefor. Prior to the distribution or redemption provided for in this Section 5(d), the Corporation shall
not expend or dissipate the consideration received for such Deemed Liquidation, except to discharge expenses incurred in connection
with such Deemed Liquidation or in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice. 

(e)
The amount deemed paid or distributed to the holders of capital stock of the Corporation upon any Liquidation Event shall be the
cash or the value of the property, rights or securities paid or distributed to such holders by the Corporation or the acquiring
person, firm or other entity; provided , that the value of any such non-cash property, rights or securities shall be determined
in good faith by the Board of Directors of the Corporation.

Section
6 . Conversion of Series B Preferred Stock into Common Stock . 

(a)
 Conversion of Series B Preferred Stock into Common Stock at Option of Holder . 

Subject
to Section 6(c) below, each share of Series B Preferred Stock shall be convertible, at any time and from time to time from and
after the Issuance Date, at the option of the Holder thereof, into a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the product of
the Series B Conversion Ratio and the number of shares of Series B Preferred Stock to be converted. Holders shall effect conversions
of Series B Preferred Stock into Common Stock by providing the Corporation with the form of conversion notice attached hereto
as Annex A (a Notice of Conversion ), duly completed and executed. Provided the Corporation s
transfer agent is participating in the Depository Trust Corporation DTC Fast Automated Securities
Transfer program, the Notice of Conversion may specify, at the Holder s election, whether the applicable Conversion Shares
shall be credited to the DTC participant account nominated by the Holder through DTC s Deposit Withdrawal Agent Commission
system (a DWAC Delivery ). The Optional Conversion Date , or the date on
which a conversion shall be deemed effective, shall be defined as the Trading Day after the Trading Date that the Notice of Conversion,
completed and executed, is sent by facsimile or other electronic transmission to, and received during regular business hours by,
the Corporation; provided that the original certificate(s) (if any) representing such shares of Series B Preferred Stock being
converted, duly endorsed, and the accompanying Notice of Conversion, are received by the Corporation within two (2) Trading Days
thereafter. In all other cases, the Optional Conversion Date shall be defined as the Trading Day after the Trading Date on which
the original shares of Series B Preferred Stock being converted, duly endorsed, and the accompanying Notice of Conversion, are
received by the Corporation. 

(b)
 Mandatory Conversion of Series B Preferred Stock into Common Stock . If the Corporation consummates the sale of shares of
Common Stock to the public in a firm-commitment underwritten public offering pursuant to an effective registration statement under
the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, pursuant to which (A) the price per share of the Common Stock in such offering is at least
the Series B Mandatory Conversion Price (subject to appropriate adjustment in the event of any stock dividend, stock split, combination
or other similar recapitalization affecting such shares) and (B) such offering results in at least 25 million in proceeds, net
of the underwriting discount and commissions, to the Corporation and the Common Stock continues to be listed for trading on the
Nasdaq Capital Market or another Exchange such as NYSE (such offering, an Underwritten Offering , and
the date of the consummation of such Underwritten Offering is referred to herein as the Mandatory Conversion Date 
and together with each Optional Conversion Date, a Conversion Date ), (i) all outstanding shares of
Series B Preferred Stock shall automatically be converted into shares of Common Stock, at the then effective Series B Conversion
Ratio and (ii) such shares may not be reissued by the Corporation. The provisions of Section 6(c) shall apply, with such necessary
changes in the details thereof as are necessitated by the context, to the conversion of shares of Series B Preferred Stock into
Common Stock pursuant to this Section 6(b). Notwithstanding the foregoing, an Underwritten Offering shall not include, and shares
of Series B Preferred Stock will not automatically convert to shares of Common Stock upon the consummation of, any Underwritten
Offering that includes the issuance of warrants to purchase capital stock of the Corporation or any other Convertible Security. 

10 

(c)
 Mechanics of Conversion of Series B Preferred Stock into Common Stock. 

(i)
 Delivery of Certificate or Electronic Issuance Upon Conversion . Not later than three (3) Trading Days after the applicable
Conversion Date (the Share Delivery Date ), the Corporation shall electronically transfer the number
of Conversion Shares set forth in a Notice of Conversion being acquired upon the conversion of shares of Series B Preferred Stock
by crediting the DTC participant account nominated by the Holder through DTC s DWAC system. If in the case such shares are
not electronically delivered to or as directed by, the applicable Holder by the Share Delivery Date, the applicable Holder shall
be entitled to elect to rescind such Notice of Conversion by written notice to the Corporation at any time on or before its receipt
of such certificate or certificates for Conversion Shares or electronic receipt of such shares, as applicable, in which event
the Corporation shall promptly return to such Holder any original Series B Preferred Stock certificate delivered to the Corporation
and such Holder shall promptly direct the return of any shares of Common Stock delivered to the Holder through the DWAC system,
representing the shares of Series B Preferred Stock unsuccessfully tendered for conversion to the Corporation. 

(ii)
 Obligation Absolute . Subject to Holder s right to rescind a Notice of Conversion pursuant to Section 6(c)(i) above,
the Corporation s obligation to issue and deliver the Conversion Shares upon conversion of Series B Preferred Stock in accordance
with the terms hereof are absolute and unconditional, irrespective of any action or inaction by a Holder to enforce the same,
any waiver or consent with respect to any provision hereof, the recovery of any judgment against any Person or any action to enforce
the same, or any setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, limitation or termination, or any breach or alleged breach by such Holder or
any other Person of any obligation to the Corporation or any violation or alleged violation of law by such Holder or any other
Person, and irrespective of any other circumstance which might otherwise limit such obligation of the Corporation to such Holder
in connection with the issuance of such Conversion Shares. Nothing herein shall limit a Holder s right to pursue actual
damages for the Corporation s failure to deliver Conversion Shares within the period specified herein and such Holder shall
have the right to pursue all remedies available to it hereunder, at law or in equity including, without limitation, a decree of
specific performance and/or injunctive relief; provided that Holder shall not receive duplicate damages for the Corporation s
failure to deliver Conversion Shares within the period specified herein. The exercise of any such rights shall not prohibit a
Holder from seeking to enforce damages pursuant to any other Section hereof or under applicable law. 

(iii)
 Compensation for Buy-In on Failure to Timely Deliver Shares Upon Conversion . If the Corporation fails to effect a DWAC
Delivery that represents shares of Common Stock by the Share Delivery Date pursuant to Section 6(c)(i) (other than a failure caused
by incorrect or incomplete information provided by Holder to the Corporation), and if after such Share Delivery Date such Holder
is required to or otherwise purchases (in an open market transaction or otherwise), shares of Common Stock to deliver in satisfaction
of a sale by such Holder of the Conversion Shares which such Holder was entitled to receive upon the conversion relating to such
Share Delivery Date (a Buy-In ), then the Corporation shall (A) pay in cash to such Holder (in addition
to any other remedies available to or elected by such Holder) the amount by which (x) such Holder s total purchase price
(including any brokerage commissions) for the shares of Common Stock so purchased exceeds (y) the product of (1) the aggregate
number of shares of Common Stock that such Holder was entitled to receive from the conversion at issue multiplied by (2) the actual
sale price at which the sell order giving rise to such purchase obligation was executed (including any brokerage commissions)
and (B) at the option of such Holder, either reissue (if surrendered) the shares of Series B Preferred Stock equal to the number
of shares of Series B Preferred Stock submitted for conversion or deliver to such Holder the number of shares of Common Stock
that would have been issued if the Corporation had timely complied with its delivery requirements under Section 6(c)(i). For example,
if a Holder purchases shares of Common Stock having a total purchase price of 11,000 to cover a Buy-In with respect to an attempted
conversion of shares of Series B Preferred Stock with respect to which the actual sale price (including any brokerage commissions)
giving rise to such purchase obligation was a total of 10,000 under clause (A) of the immediately preceding sentence, the Corporation
shall be required to pay such Holder 1,000. The Holder shall provide the Corporation written notice, within three (3) Trading
Days after the occurrence of a Buy-In, indicating the amounts payable to such Holder in respect of such Buy-In together with applicable
confirmations and other evidence reasonably requested by the Corporation. Nothing herein shall limit a Holder s right to
pursue any other remedies available to it hereunder, at law or in equity including, without limitation, a decree of specific performance
and/or injunctive relief with respect to the Corporation s failure to timely effect a DWAC Delivery representing shares
of Common Stock upon conversion of the shares of Series B Preferred Stock as required pursuant to the terms hereof; provided,
however, that the Holder shall not be entitled to both (i) require the reissuance of the shares of Series B Preferred Stock submitted
for conversion for which such conversion was not timely honored and (ii) receive the number of shares of Common Stock that would
have been issued if the Corporation had timely complied with its delivery requirements under Section 6(c)(i). 

11 

(d)
 Reservation of Shares Issuable Upon Conversion . The Corporation covenants that it will, at all times reserve and keep available
out of its authorized and unissued shares of Common Stock for the sole purpose of issuance upon conversion of the Series B Preferred
Stock, free from preemptive rights or any other actual contingent purchase rights of Persons other than the Holders of the Series
B Preferred Stock, not less than such aggregate number of shares of the Common Stock as shall be issuable (taking into account
the adjustments of Section 7) upon the conversion of all outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock. The Corporation covenants
that all shares of Common Stock that shall be so issuable shall, upon issue, be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid, non-assessable
and free and clear of all liens and other encumbrances. 

(e)
 Fractional Shares . No fractional shares or scrip representing fractional shares of Common Stock shall be issued upon the
conversion of the Series B Preferred Stock. As to any fraction of a share of Common Stock which a Holder would otherwise be entitled
to receive upon such conversion, the Corporation shall pay a cash adjustment in respect of such final fraction in an amount equal
to such fraction multiplied by the Series B Conversion Price. 

(f)
 Transfer Taxes . The issuance of book entry notations for shares of the Common Stock upon conversion of the Series B Preferred
Stock shall be made without charge to any Holder for any documentary stamp or similar taxes that may be payable in respect of
the issue of such book entry notation, provided that the Corporation shall not be required to pay any tax that may be payable
in respect of any transfer involved in the issuance of such book entry notation upon conversion in a name other than that of the
registered Holder(s) of such shares of Series B Preferred Stock, and the Corporation shall not be required to issue such book
entry notation unless or until the Person or Persons requesting the issuance thereof shall have paid to the Corporation the amount
of such tax or shall have established to the satisfaction of the Corporation that such tax has been paid. 

(g)
 Status as Stockholder . Upon each Conversion Date and Mandatory Conversion Date: (i) the shares of Series B Preferred Stock
being converted shall be deemed converted into shares of Common Stock; and (ii) the Holder s rights as a holder of such
converted shares of Series B Preferred Stock shall cease and terminate, excepting only the right to receive book entry notations
for such shares of Common Stock and to any remedies provided herein or otherwise available at law or in equity to such Holder
because of a failure by the Corporation to comply with the terms of this Certificate of Designation. In all cases, the Holder
shall retain all of its rights and remedies for the Corporation s failure to convert Series B Preferred Stock. 

12 

Section
7 . Certain Adjustments . 

(a)
 Stock Dividends and Stock Splits . If the Corporation, at any time while any shares of Series B Preferred Stock are outstanding:

the then outstanding shares of Common Stock; (ii) subdivides outstanding shares of Common Stock into a larger number of shares;
or (iii) combines (including by way of a reverse stock split) outstanding shares of Common Stock into a smaller number of shares,
then the Series B Conversion Price shall be multiplied by a fraction of which the numerator shall be the number of shares of Common
Stock (excluding any treasury shares of the Corporation) outstanding immediately before such event and of which the denominator
shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event (excluding any treasury shares of the Corporation).
Any adjustment made pursuant to this Section 7(a) shall become effective immediately after the record date for the determination
of stockholders entitled to receive such dividend or distribution and shall become effective immediately after the effective date
in the case of a subdivision or combination. 

(b)

the Issuance Date shall make or issue, or fix a record date for the determination of holders of Common Stock entitled to receive,
a dividend or other distribution payable in securities of the Corporation (other than a distribution of shares of Common Stock
in respect of outstanding shares of Common Stock) or in other property, then and in each such event the Holders of Series B Preferred
Stock shall receive, simultaneously with the distribution to the holders of Common Stock, a dividend or other distribution of
such securities or other property in an amount equal to the amount of such securities or other property as they would have received
if all outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock had been converted into Common Stock on the date of such event. 

(c)
 Adjustment for Merger or Reorganization, etc . Subject to the provisions of Section 5, if there shall occur any reorganization,
recapitalization, reclassification, consolidation or merger involving the Corporation in which the Common Stock (but not the Series
B Preferred Stock) is converted into or exchanged for securities, cash or other property (other than a transaction covered by
Section 7(a) or Section 7(b)), then, following any such reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, consolidation or merger,
each share of Series B Preferred Stock shall thereafter be convertible in lieu of the Common Stock into which it was convertible
prior to such event into the kind and amount of securities, cash or other property which a holder of the number of shares of Common
Stock of the Corporation issuable upon conversion of one share of Series B Preferred Stock immediately prior to such reorganization,
recapitalization, reclassification, consolidation or merger would have been entitled to receive pursuant to such transaction;
and, in such case, appropriate adjustment (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors of the Corporation) shall be
made in the application of the provisions in this Certificate of Designation with respect to the rights and interests thereafter
of the Holders of the Series B Preferred Stock, to the end that the provisions set forth in this Certificate of Designation (including
provisions with respect to changes in and other adjustments of the Series B Conversion Price) shall thereafter be applicable,
as nearly as reasonably may be, in relation to any securities or other property thereafter deliverable upon the conversion of
the Series B Preferred Stock.

issued and outstanding.

 Adjustment to Series B Conversion Price . Whenever the Series B Conversion Price is adjusted pursuant to any provision of

(ii)
 Other Notices . If (A) the Corporation shall declare a dividend (or any other distribution in whatever form) on the Common
Stock, (B) the Corporation shall declare a special nonrecurring cash dividend on or a redemption of the Common Stock, (C) the
Corporation shall authorize the granting to all holders of the Common Stock of rights or warrants to subscribe for or purchase
any shares of capital stock of any class or of any rights, (D) the approval of any stockholders of the Corporation shall be required
in connection with any reclassification of the Common Stock, any consolidation or merger to which the Corporation is a party,
any Liquidation, or any compulsory share exchange whereby the Common Stock is converted into other securities, cash or property,
or (E) consent of the Holders of Series B Preferred Stock is required pursuant to Section 4(c) or Section 4(d), then, in each

action to enforce the same, or any setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, limitation or termination, or any breach or alleged breach by such
Holder or any other Person of any obligation to the Corporation or any violation or alleged violation of law by such Holder or any other
Person, and irrespective of any other circumstance which might otherwise limit such obligation of the Corporation to such Holder in connection
with the issuance of such Conversion Shares. Nothing herein shall limit a Holder s right to pursue actual damages for the Corporation s
failure to deliver Conversion Shares within the period specified herein and such Holder shall have the right to pursue all remedies available
to it hereunder, at law or in equity including, without limitation, a decree of specific performance and/or injunctive relief; provided
that Holder shall not receive duplicate damages for the Corporation s failure to deliver Conversion Shares within the period specified
herein. The exercise of any such rights shall not prohibit a Holder from seeking to enforce damages pursuant to any other Section hereof
or under applicable law. 

(d)
 Reservation of Shares Issuable Upon Conversion . The Corporation covenants that it will, at all times reserve and keep available
out of its authorized and unissued shares of Common Stock for the sole purpose of issuance upon conversion of the Series C Preferred

Stock that shall be so issuable shall, upon issue, be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid, non-assessable and free and clear
of all liens and other encumbrances.

Stock shall be made without charge to any Holder for any documentary stamp or similar taxes that may be payable in respect of the issue

transfer involved in the issuance of such book entry notation upon conversion in a name other than that of the registered Holder(s) of
such shares of Series C Preferred Stock, and the Corporation shall not be required to issue such book entry notation unless or until
the Person or Persons requesting the issuance thereof shall have paid to the Corporation the amount of such tax or shall have established

 Status as Stockholder . Upon each Conversion Date: (i) the shares of Series C Preferred Stock being converted shall be deemed converted
into shares of Common Stock; and (ii) the Holder s rights as a holder of such converted shares of Series C Preferred Stock shall
cease and terminate, excepting only the right to receive book entry notations for such shares of Common Stock and to any remedies provided
herein or otherwise available at law or in equity to such Holder because of a failure by the Corporation to comply with the terms of
this Certificate of Designation. In all cases, the Holder shall retain all of its rights and remedies for the Corporation s failure
to convert Series C Preferred Stock. 

Section
7 . Certain Adjustments . 

(a)
 Stock Dividends and Stock Splits . If the Corporation, at any time while any shares of Series C Preferred Stock are outstanding:

outstanding shares of Common Stock; (ii) subdivides outstanding shares of Common Stock into a larger number of shares; or (iii) combines
(including by way of a reverse stock split) outstanding shares of Common Stock into a smaller number of shares, then the Series C Conversion
Price shall be multiplied by a fraction of which the numerator shall be the number of shares of Common Stock (excluding any treasury
shares of the Corporation) outstanding immediately before such event and of which the denominator shall be the number of shares of Common
Stock outstanding immediately after such event (excluding any treasury shares of the Corporation). Any adjustment made pursuant to this
Section 7(a) shall become effective immediately after the record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such
dividend or distribution and shall become effective immediately after the effective date in the case of a subdivision or combination. 

(b)
 Adjustments for Other Dividends and Distributions . In the event the Corporation at any time or from time to time after the Issuance
Date shall make or issue, or fix a record date for the determination of holders of Common Stock entitled to receive, a dividend or other
distribution payable in securities of the Corporation (other than a distribution of shares of Common Stock in respect of outstanding
shares of Common Stock) or in other property, then and in each such event the Holders of Series C Preferred Stock shall receive, simultaneously
with the distribution to the holders of Common Stock, a dividend or other distribution of such securities or other property in an amount
equal to the amount of such securities or other property as they would have received if all outstanding shares of Series C Preferred
Stock had been converted into Common Stock on the date of such event. 

(c)
 Adjustment for Merger or Reorganization, etc . Subject to the provisions of Section 5, if there shall occur any reorganization,
recapitalization, reclassification, consolidation or merger involving the Corporation in which the Common Stock (but not the Series C
Preferred Stock) is converted into or exchanged for securities, cash or other property (other than a transaction covered by Section 7(a)
or Section 7(b)), then, following any such reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, consolidation or merger, each share of
Series C Preferred Stock shall thereafter be convertible in lieu of the Common Stock into which it was convertible prior to such event
into the kind and amount of securities, cash or other property which a holder of the number of shares of Common Stock of the Corporation
issuable upon conversion of one share of Series C Preferred Stock immediately prior to such reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification,
consolidation or merger would have been entitled to receive pursuant to such transaction; and, in such case, appropriate adjustment (as
determined in good faith by the Board of Directors of the Corporation) shall be made in the application of the provisions in this Certificate
of Designation with respect to the rights and interests thereafter of the Holders of the Series C Preferred Stock, to the end that the
provisions set forth in this Certificate of Designation (including provisions with respect to changes in and other adjustments of the
Series C Conversion Price) shall thereafter be applicable, as nearly as reasonably may be, in relation to any securities or other property
thereafter deliverable upon the conversion of the Series C Preferred Stock. 

(d)
 Calculations . All calculations under this Certificate of Designation shall be made to the nearest cent or the nearest 1/100th
of a share, as the case may be. For purposes of this Section 7, the number of shares of Common Stock deemed to be issued and outstanding
as of a given date shall be the sum of the number of shares of Common Stock (excluding any treasury shares of the Corporation) issued
and outstanding. 

5 

(e)
 Notice to the Holders . 

(i)
 Adjustment to Series C Conversion Price . Whenever the Series C Conversion Price is adjusted pursuant to any provision of this
Section 7, the Corporation shall promptly deliver to each Holder a notice setting forth the Series C Conversion Ratio after such adjustment
and setting forth a brief statement of the facts requiring such adjustment. 

(ii)
 Other Notices . If (A) the Corporation shall declare a dividend (or any other distribution in whatever form) on the Common Stock,
(B) the Corporation shall declare a special nonrecurring cash dividend on or a redemption of the Common Stock, (C) the Corporation shall
authorize the granting to all holders of the Common Stock of rights or warrants to subscribe for or purchase any shares of capital stock
of any class or of any rights, or (D) the approval of any stockholders of the Corporation shall be required in connection with any reclassification
of the Common Stock, any consolidation or merger to which the Corporation is a party, any Liquidation, or any compulsory share exchange
whereby the Common Stock is converted into other securities, cash or property, then, in each case, the Corporation shall cause to be
filed at each office or agency maintained for the purpose of conversion of the shares of Series C Preferred Stock, and shall cause to
be delivered to each Holder at its last address as it shall appear upon the stock books of the Corporation, at least ten (10) calendar
days prior to the applicable record or effective date hereinafter specified, a notice stating (x) the date on which a record is to be
taken for the purpose of such dividend, distribution, redemption, rights or warrants, or if a record is not to be taken, the date as
of which the holders of the Common Stock of record to be entitled to such dividend, distributions, redemption, rights or warrants are
to be determined or (y) the date on which such reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale, transfer, Liquidation or share exchange
is expected to become effective or close, and the date as of which it is expected that holders of the Common Stock of record shall be
entitled to exchange their shares of the Common Stock for securities, cash or other property deliverable upon such reclassification,
consolidation, merger, sale, transfer or share exchange, provided that the failure to deliver such notice or any defect therein or in
the delivery thereof shall not affect the validity of the corporate action required to be specified in such notice. 

Section
8 . Miscellaneous . 

(a)
 Lost or Mutilated Stock Certificates . If a Holder s certificate representing shares of Series C Preferred Stock shall be
mutilated, lost, stolen or destroyed, the Corporation shall execute and deliver, if requested by the Holder, in exchange and substitution
for and upon cancellation of a mutilated certificate, or in lieu of or in substitution for a lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, a
new certificate for the shares of Series C Preferred Stock so mutilated, lost, stolen or destroyed, but only upon receipt of evidence
of such loss, theft or destruction of such certificate, and of the ownership thereof, reasonably satisfactory to the Corporation and,
in each case, customary and reasonable indemnity, if requested, without the requirement to post a bond. Applicants for a new certificate
under such circumstances shall also comply with such other reasonable regulations and procedures and pay such other reasonable third-party
costs as the Corporation may prescribe, without the requirement to post a bond. 

(b)
 Waiver . Any waiver by the Corporation or a Holder of a breach of any provision of this Certificate of Designation shall not operate
as or be construed to be a waiver of any other breach of such provision or of any breach of any other provision of this Certificate of
Designation or a waiver by any other Holders. The failure of the Corporation or a Holder to insist upon strict adherence to any term
of this Certificate of Designation on one or more occasions shall not be considered a waiver or deprive that party (or any other Holder)
of the right thereafter to insist upon strict adherence to that term or any other term of this Certificate of Designation. Any waiver
by the Corporation or a Holder must be in writing. Notwithstanding any provision in this Certificate of Designation to the contrary,
any provision contained herein and any right of the Holders of Series C Preferred Stock granted hereunder may be waived as to all shares
of Series C Preferred Stock (and the Holders thereof) upon the written consent of the Holders of at least seventy-five percent (75 of the shares of Series C Preferred Stock (voting as a single class) then outstanding, unless a higher percentage is required by the
DGCL, in which case the written consent of the Holders of not less than such higher percentage shall be required. 

6 

(c)
 Severability . If any provision of this Certificate of Designation is invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the balance of this Certificate
of Designation shall remain in effect, and if any provision is inapplicable to any Person or circumstance, it shall nevertheless remain
applicable to all other Persons and circumstances. If it shall be found that any interest or other amount deemed interest due hereunder
violates the applicable law governing usury, the applicable rate of interest due hereunder shall automatically be lowered to equal the
maximum rate of interest permitted under applicable law. 

(d)
 Next Business Day . Whenever any payment or other obligation hereunder shall be due on a day other than a Business Day, such payment
shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day. 

(e)
 Headings . The headings contained herein are for convenience only, do not constitute a part of this Certificate of Designation
and shall not be deemed to limit or affect any of the provisions hereof. 

(f)
 Status of Converted Series C Preferred Stock . If any shares of Series C Preferred Stock shall be converted or redeemed by the
Corporation, such shares shall resume the status of authorized but unissued shares of preferred stock and shall no longer be designated
as Series C Preferred Stock.
