On July 1, 2024, Instructure acquired all outstanding equity interests of Community Software Solutions, LLC Scribbles , a leading provider of credentialing and records management to K-12 school districts across the United States, in an all cash transaction. The purchase was financed through a combination of cash on hand and million of debt financing under the Company's Senior Revolver, which was repaid in full on July 25, 2024. The purpose of the transaction is to bolster the scale and reach of the Instructure Learning Platform as learners are engaged throughout their lifelong learning journey, facilitating evidence of learning and streamlining the educational process for educators and learners during key transitions. At the time of the acquisition, we recorded a provisional net deferred tax liability of million in purchase accounting due to the step up in book basis of intangible assets as a result of the stock acquisition. We expect the net deferred tax liability to decrease as book amortization expense is recognized on the acquisition-related intangible assets. The allocations below will remain provisional until tax returns are filed for Scribbles.

Actual revenue and net income recorded on Instructure's condensed combined statement of operations and comprehensive loss for Scribbles during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 are not material. For all periods presented, the excess of purchase consideration over the fair value of net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired is recorded as goodwill, of which million is expected to be deductible for tax purposes from the Parchment acquisition. The goodwill generated from acquisitions is attributable to the expected synergies to be achieved following the consummation of the business combination and the assembled workforce values. The fair values assigned to tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based on management s estimates and assumptions. Developed technology represents the estimated fair value of the acquired existing technology and is being amortized over its estimated useful life of . Amortization of developed technology is included in subscription and support cost of revenue expenses in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.

For SOFR loans, the loans denominated in dollars now bear interest at the Adjusted Term SOFR Rate, which is equal to the Term SOFR Reference Rate, as published by the CME Term SOFR Administrator, plus the Term SOFR Adjustment as dictated by the interest rate period elected by the Company. The Term SOFR Adjustment ranges from to per annum.

Instruments Not Recorded at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis 	 We estimate the fair value of our Senior Term Loan and 2023 Incremental Term Loans carried at face value, less unamortized discount costs, quarterly for disclosure purposes. The estimated fair value of our Senior Term Loan, 2023 Incremental Term Loans, and Senior Revolver is determined by Level 2 inputs, observable market-based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data. As of September 30, 2024, the fair value of our Senior Term Loan and 2023 Incremental Term Loans was million. The carrying amounts of our cash, prepaid expenses, other current assets, and accrued liabilities approximate their current fair value because of their nature and relatively short maturity dates or durations. 

. These leases require monthly lease payments that may be subject to annual increases throughout the lease term. The Company subleases four of its locations. The first sublease expired in the second quarter of 2023, the second sublease expired in the second quarter of 2024, and the third and fourth sublease terms had and remaining as of September 30, 2024, respectively. The subleases do not have an option for renewal.
 During the first quarter of 2024, the Company vacated multiple floors of its leased office space at its headquarters in Salt Lake City, Utah, with the intention of subleasing the vacated office space. As a result, the Company recognized a loss on exit of leased properties of million in the first quarter of 2024, of which million was recognized in subscription and support cost of revenue, million in professional services and other cost of revenue, million in sales and marketing, million in research and development, and million in general and administrative in our condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. Additionally, during the first quarter of 2024, the Company amended its lease for the remaining office space that it currently occupies at its headquarter location by extending the lease term from March 1, 2024 through February 28, 2029. As a result, the Company recorded a right-of-use asset and lease liability of million during the first quarter of 2024. Operating lease right-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of the lease payments over the lease term. Right-of-use assets also include adjustments related to prepaid or deferred lease payments and lease incentives. As most of our leases do not provide an implicit interest rate, we use our incremental borrowing rate based on information available at the lease commencement date to determine the present value of lease payments.

If only a range of estimated losses can be determined, we accrue an amount within the range that, in our judgment, reflects the most likely outcome; if none of the estimates within that range is a better estimate than any other amount, we accrue the low end of the range. The Company has received two complaints by purported stockholders of the Company filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery seeking to compel inspection of books and records related to the Merger. We are currently unable to predict the outcome of this matter, and as a result, potential losses, if any, cannot be estimated.

The following discussion contains forward-looking statements. See the Forward-Looking Statements section of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 Overview 
 From the inception of a teacher s lesson through a student s mastery of a concept, Instructure personalizes, simplifies, organizes, and automates the entire learning lifecycle through the power of technology. Our platform delivers the elements that leaders, teachers, and learners need a next-generation LMS, robust assessments for learning, actionable analytics, and engaging, dynamic course content. Schools standardize on Instructure s solutions as the core of their learning platform because we bring together all of the tools that students, teachers, parents, and administrators need to create an accessible, engaging and modern learning environment. Our platform is cloud-native, built on open technologies, and scalable across thousands of institutions and tens of millions of users worldwide. Instructure is the LMS market share leader in both Higher Education and paid K-12, with over 8,000 global customers, representing Higher Education institutions and K-12 districts and schools in more than 100 countries. We are maniacally focused on our customers and enhancing the teaching and learning experience. As such, we continuously innovate to grow the functionality and capabilities of our platform, including through acquisitions. Our platform becomes the invaluable digital infrastructure behind our customers instructional workflows. We acquired Parchment in February 2024, the world's largest academic credentialing platform and network. By adding Parchment to the Instructure Learning Platform, we provide a verifiable and comprehensive digital passport of achievement records and outcomes for learners. On July 1, 2024, we acquired Scribbles, a leading provider of credentialing and records management to K-12 school districts across the United States. The purpose of the transaction is to bolster the scale and reach of the Instructure Learning Platform, facilitating evidence of learning and streamlining the educational process for educators and learners during key transitions. Integration efforts for Scribbles have commenced. Identification of Parchment s and Scribbles global customer count within Instructure's ecosystem is ongoing as part of our go-to-market alignment and integration efforts. 
 Since our founding in 2008, we have expanded our platform from the core LMS to include a broad set of offerings targeting all aspects of teaching, learning, and credentialing. As our platform has grown, we have become more strategic to schools as they seek vendor consolidation, best of breed solutions, and integrated offerings to serve teachers and students.

 Take-Private Merger Agreement 
 On July 25, 2024, Instructure entered into the Merger Agreement with Parent and Merger Sub. Parent and Merger Sub are each affiliates of investment funds managed by KKR, a leading global investment firm. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub will be merged with and into the Company, with the Company surviving as a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent. Under, and subject to, the terms of the Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the Merger, Instructure stockholders will have the right to receive 23.60 per share in cash, without interest thereon and subject to applicable withholding taxes. The Company s board of directors has unanimously approved the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby and the necessary stockholder approval has been duly executed and delivered, adopting and approving the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby. The obligations of the parties to complete the proposed Merger are subject to customary closing conditions, including, among others, the receipt of certain regulatory approvals. Effective as of 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on September 9, 2024, the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, expired with respect to the Merger. 
 On September 5, 2024, Instructure filed with the SEC, a Definitive Information Statement on Schedule 14, containing more information about the Merger Agreement and the Merger. 
 The proposed Merger is expected to close during the second half of 2024, although Instructure cannot assure completion by any particular date, if at all. Upon consummation of the Merger, the Company will be a privately held company and its common stock will no longer be traded on the New York Stock Exchange. 
 Macroeconomic Conditions and Trends 
 Adverse macroeconomic conditions, including but not limited to high inflation, slower economic growth, changes to fiscal and monetary policy, and high interest rates could impact our business and customer spending. Certain of our customers may be negatively impacted by these events. 
 We have continued to experience high usage on our platform as our customers continue to embrace remote learning platforms and demand for our products remains high. These factors have generated a positive impact to our gross margin. 
 Instructure has witnessed a noteworthy surge in the volume of Non-Traditional use case projects entering the market. The expanding Non-Traditional student segment presents a substantial growth opportunity, and we believe Instructure is strategically positioned to seize this market share. Leveraging the awareness gained from Kindergarten through Higher Ed utilization and Instructure's product competencies in credentialing, further enhances our advantage in capturing this evolving market. 
 The U.S dollar has fluctuated relative to foreign currencies upon the U.S. Federal Reserve's lowering the federal funds interest rate. Our reported expenses have immaterially decreased as a result. The interest rate applicable to our Senior Term Loan decreased slightly from 8.68 as of December 31, 2023 to 8.07 as of September 30, 2024. These items have not had a material impact on our results of operations to date. 
 Key Factors Affecting Our Performance 
 Our historical financial performance has been, and we expect our financial performance in the future to be, driven by the following trends and our ability to: 
 Increase Adoption of Cloud-Based Software by Higher Education and K-12 Institutions 
 Our ability to increase market adoption of our platform is driven by the overall adoption of cloud applications and infrastructure by academic institutions. We believe that Higher Education and K-12 institutions continue to be poised to accelerate the pace of cloud adoption to support near-term online educational needs as a result of continued adoption of remote education and continued digital transformation in education, to withstand future challenges. Academic institutions that relied upon on-premise solutions to support remote operations faced significant delays at the height of the pandemic. To be prepared for any similar future health crisis, institutions must make a fundamental shift to adopt cloud-based collaboration solutions. In order to continue providing a high-quality education and support in-person, remote, and hybrid learning. As the leader in the market for cloud-based learning technology, we believe the imperative for these institutions to adopt cloud infrastructure will increase demand for our platform and broaden our customer base.

Table of Contents 

Grow Our Customer Base 
 We believe there is significant opportunity to grow our customer base in Higher Education and K-12. The growth of our Higher Education customer base is primarily dependent on the replacement of legacy systems with our cloud-native platform in North America and our continued expansion efforts internationally. The growth of our K-12 customer base is primarily dependent on our ability to surround currently implemented free solutions with our learning platform and, in connection therewith, monetize demand for our broad capabilities. We intend to expand our customer base by continuing to make targeted and prudent investments in sales and marketing and customer support. 
 Cross-sell into our Existing Customer Base 
 Most of our customers initially engage with us using our Canvas LMS solution, and then we are generally able to cross-sell our other solutions as these customers become aware of the benefits of our broad capabilities, including learning, assessments, analytics, student success, program management, digital courseware, and global online learning. Our future revenue growth is dependent upon our ability to expand our customers use of our learning platform. Our ability to increase sales to existing customers depends on a number of factors, including customer satisfaction, competition, pricing, economic conditions, and spending by customers. 
 Key Components of Results of Operations 
 Revenue 
 We generate revenue primarily from two main sources: (1) subscription and support revenue, which is comprised of SaaS fees from customers accessing our learning platform and usage of our credential management platform, and from customers purchasing additional support beyond the standard support that is included in the basic SaaS fees; and (2) related professional services revenue, which is comprised of training, implementation services and other types of professional services. 
 Subscription revenue is derived from customers using our learning platform and is driven primarily by the number of customers, the number of users at each customer, the price of our applications, and renewals. Support revenue is derived from customers purchasing additional support beyond the standard support that is included in the basic SaaS fee. Our contracts typically vary in length between one and five years. Subscriptions and support are non-cancelable and are billed in advance on an annual basis. All subscription and support fees billed are initially recorded in deferred revenue and recognized ratably over the subscription term. Revenue derived from the use of our credential management platform is also subscription and support revenue, and is generally recognized based on the proportion of credentials transferred to the total estimated credentials to be transferred over the contract period. Customers choose to access and use the credential management platform through subscription contracts by committing to guaranteed minimum payments with excess volume billed in arrears, or through transactional contracts where payment generally occurs once an order is placed. The Company records pass through fees for transactional contracts on a net revenue basis, as the Company does not have control over the credential and is therefore acting as the agent. 
 Professional services and other revenue are derived primarily from training, implementation, and other professional fees, which generally take anywhere from 30 to 90 days to complete depending on customer-side complexity and timelines. These services include regularly scheduled and highly-structured activities to ensure customers progress toward better utilizing our applications. Most of these interactions take place over the phone and through the use of web meeting technology. Because we have determined the implementation services are distinct, they are recognized over time as the services are rendered, using an efforts-expended input method. Implementation services also include nonrefundable upfront setup fees, which are allocated to the remaining performance obligations. 
 Instructure offers customers training services for an incremental fee which focus on creating confidence among users so they can be successful with our applications. Most training is performed remotely using web meeting technology, while the remainder is delivered in person. Because we have determined that training offerings are distinct from other performance obligations, we record training revenue upon the delivery of the service which can vary based on the nature of the training purchased. For trainings that are delivered live, revenue is recognized upon delivery. The Company offers customers unlimited access to online training services for a defined period of time, whereby revenue is recognized ratably over the defined contract term. 
 In addition to our implementation and training offerings, we provide consulting services for custom application development, integrations, content services and change management consulting. These services are architected to boost customer adoption of our applications and to drive usage of features and capabilities that are unique to our company. We have determined that these services are distinct. Professional services revenue is typically recognized over time as the services are rendered, using an efforts-expended input method.

Table of Contents 

Cost of Revenue 
 Cost of subscription and support revenue consists primarily of the costs of our cloud hosting provider and other third-party service providers, employee-related costs including payroll, benefits and stock-based compensation expense for our operations and customer support teams, amortization of capitalized software development costs and acquired technology, costs associated with our print operations, and allocated overhead costs, which we define as rent, facilities and costs related to information technology. Our technology acquired through mergers and acquisitions is measured at its estimated fair value and is amortized over its estimated useful life, which is five years. 
 Cost of professional services and other revenue consists primarily of personnel costs of our professional services organization, including salaries, benefits, travel, bonuses and stock-based compensation, as well as allocated overhead costs. 
 Operating Expenses 
 Sales and Marketing. Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel costs of our sales and marketing employees, including sales commissions and incentives, benefits and stock-based compensation expense, marketing programs, including lead generation, costs of our annual InstructureCon user conference, acquisition-related amortization expenses and allocated overhead costs. We defer and amortize on a straight-line basis sales commission costs related to acquiring new contracts over a period of benefit that we have determined to be generally four years. Customer relationships represent the estimated fair value of the acquired customer bases and are amortized over the estimated useful life of seven to ten years. The trade names acquired are amortized over the estimated useful lives ranging from one to ten years. 
 Research and Development . Research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel costs of our development team, including payroll, benefits and stock-based compensation expense and allocated overhead costs. We capitalize certain software development costs that are attributable to developing new applications, features and adding incremental functionality to our platform. We amortize these costs to subscription and support cost of revenue in the condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss over the estimated life of the new application or incremental functionality, which is generally three years. 
 General and Administrative . General and administrative expenses consist of personnel costs and related expenses for executive, finance, legal, human resources, recruiting, employee-related information technology, administrative personnel, including payroll, benefits and stock-based compensation expense; professional fees for external legal, accounting and other consulting services; and allocated overhead costs. 
 Other Income (Expense), net 
 Other income (expense), net consists primarily of interest income, interest expense, and the impact of foreign currency transaction gains and losses. Interest expense is related to fees incurred to have access to our credit facilities. As we have expanded our international operations, our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currencies has increased.

Table of Contents 

Income Tax Benefit 
 We are subject to income taxes in the United States and foreign jurisdictions in which we do business. These foreign jurisdictions have statutory tax rates different from those in the United States. Accordingly, our effective tax rates will vary depending on the relative proportion of foreign to U.S. income and changes in tax laws. The income tax benefit at September 30, 2024 consists of decreases in U.S. Federal and state deferred tax liabilities due to current year pretax book loss, net of valuation allowance released. 
 Results of Operations 
 The following tables set forth our results of operations for the periods presented and as a percentage of our total revenue for those periods. The data has been derived from the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q which include, in our opinion, all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, that we consider necessary for a fair presentation of the financial position and results of operations for the interim periods presented. The period-to-period comparison of financial results is not necessarily indicative of financial results to be achieved in future periods.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 As of December 31, 2023 our principal sources of liquidity were cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash, and, as of September 30, 2024 our principal sources of liquidity were cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and funds held on behalf of customers. For September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, these amounts totaled 203.2 million and 344.2 million, respectively, which were held for working capital purposes, as well as the available balance of our Senior Revolver (as defined below). As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, our cash equivalents were comprised of money market funds. We expect our operating cash flows to improve as we increase our operational efficiency and experience economies of scale. 
 We have financed our operations through cash received from operations and debt financing. We believe our existing cash and cash equivalents, our Amended Senior Secured Credit Facilities (as defined below) and cash provided by sales of our solutions and services will be sufficient to meet our working capital, capital expenditure and cash needs for at least the next 12 months and beyond. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors including our growth rate, the timing and extent of spending to support development efforts, the expansion of sales and marketing activities, the introduction of new and enhanced products and services offerings, the continuing market acceptance of our products, and the timing and closing of the Merger, including the magnitude of the costs related to the Merger. In the future, we may enter into arrangements to acquire or invest in complementary businesses, services and technologies. 
 Our material cash requirements from known contractual and other obligations primarily consist of payments under our Amended Senior Secured Credit Facilities and operating facility lease obligations, including certain letters of credit. See the section titled Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations set forth in our 2023 10-K for more details. 
 We may be required to seek additional equity or debt financing. In the event that additional financing is required from outside sources, we may not be able to raise it on terms acceptable to us or at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital or generate cash flows necessary to expand our operations and invest in new technologies, this could reduce our ability to compete successfully and harm our results of operations. 
 A portion of our customers pay in advance for subscriptions, a portion of which is recorded as deferred revenue. Deferred revenue consists of the unearned portion of billed fees for our subscriptions, which is later recognized as revenue in accordance with our revenue recognition policy. As of September 30, 2024, we had deferred revenue of 384.0 million, of which 374.4 million was recorded as a current liability and is expected to be recorded to revenue in the next 12 months, provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been met. As of December 31, 2023, we had deferred revenue of 302.7 million, of which 291.8 million was recorded as a current liability.

Our cash flows are subject to seasonal fluctuations. A significant portion of our contracts have terms that coincide with our customers typical fiscal year-end of June 30. Historical experience has shown an increase in new and renewed contracts as well as anniversary billings, all of which immediately precede the beginning of our academic customers typical fiscal year-end. We typically invoice SaaS fees annually upfront with credit terms of net 30 or 60 days. In turn, our cash flows from operations are affected by this seasonality and are typically reflected in higher cash flow, accounts receivable and deferred revenue balances for the second and third quarter of each year. 
 Credit Facility 
 On October 29, 2021, we entered into a credit agreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent (the 2021 Credit Agreement ), governing our senior secured credit facilities (the Senior Secured Credit Facilities ), consisting of a 500.0 million senior secured term loan facility (the Senior Term Loan and a 125.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility (the Senior Revolver ). The proceeds from the Senior Secured Credit Facilities were used, in addition to cash on hand, to (1) refinance, in full, all existing indebtedness under our initial credit agreement entered into in March 2020 with a syndicate of lenders and Golub Capital Markets LLC (the Refinancing ), (2) pay certain fees and expenses incurred in connection with the entry into the 2021 Credit Agreement and the Refinancing, and (3) finance working capital needs of the Company and its subsidiaries for general corporate purposes. 
 All of the Company s obligations under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities are guaranteed by the subsidiary guarantors named therein. The Senior Revolver includes borrowing capacity available for letters of credit. Any issuance of letters of credit will reduce the amount available under the Senior Revolver. As of September 30, 2024 there were no borrowings outstanding under the Senior Revolver. 
 The Senior Term Loan has a seven-year maturity and the Senior Revolver has a five-year maturity. Commencing June 30, 2022, we were required to repay the Senior Term Loan portion of the Senior Secured Credit Facilities in quarterly principal installments of 0.25 of the aggregate original principal amount of the Senior Term Loan at closing, with the balance payable at maturity. We are also required to pay an unused commitment fee to the lenders under the Senior Revolver at the Applicable Commitment Fee of the average daily unutilized commitments. The Applicable Commitment Fee ranges from 0.40 to 0.50 subject to the Company s Consolidated First Lien Net Leverage Ratio. 
 On June 21, 2023, we entered into the first amendment to the 2021 Credit Agreement (the Amended 2021 Credit Agreement whereby all borrowings denominated in U.S. dollars and that incur interest or fees using the Eurocurrency Rate, which are determined by reference to the London Interbank Offered Rate LIBOR ), have been replaced with the Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR ). For SOFR loans, the loans denominated in dollars now bear interest at the Adjusted Term SOFR Rate, which is equal to the Term SOFR Reference Rate, as published by the CME Term SOFR Administrator, plus the Term SOFR Adjustment as dictated by the interest rate period elected by the Company. The Term SOFR Adjustment ranges from 0.11448 to 0.42826 per annum. The Applicable Rate (x) for the Initial Term Loans remains at 2.75 per annum for SOFR loans and (y) for the Revolving Credit Facility remains at 2.5 per annum with applicable step downs. The transition from LIBOR to SOFR became effective on July 5, 2023. All other terms and conditions in place under the 2021 Credit Agreement on the effective date of the Amended 2021 Credit Agreement remained unchanged and in full effect. 
 On February 1, 2024, we entered into the second amendment to the 2021 Credit Agreement as previously amended by the Amended 2021 Credit Agreement (the Amended 2023 Credit Agreement ), by and among the Company and certain of its subsidiaries, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, and the lenders named therein. Pursuant to the Amended 2023 Credit Agreement, among certain other amendments, the lenders agreed, severally and not jointly, to extend additional 2023 Incremental Term Loans (as defined in the 2021 Credit Agreement) (the 2023 Incremental Term Loans to Instructure under the 2021 Credit Agreement in an aggregate principal amount equal to 685.0 million. The Company used the proceeds of the 2023 Incremental Term Loans, borrowed under the 2021 Credit Agreement, to finance (i) the cash consideration for the acquisition of Parchment, and (ii) fees and costs incurred in connection with the acquisition and related transactions. The Senior Secured Credit Facilities, together with the Amended 2023 Credit Agreement, comprise our amended senior secured credit facilities (the Amended Senior Secured Credit Facilities ).

As of September 30, 2024, we had outstanding borrowings of 1,167.3 million on the Senior Term Loan and the 2023 Incremental Term Loans, no outstanding borrowings under our Senior Revolver and 1.0 million outstanding under letters of credit. 
 Operating Activities

 Net cash provided by operating activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 102.5 million, which was attributable to a net loss of 77.3 million adjusted for certain non-cash items, including 42.4 million of stock-based compensation expense, 136.4 million of depreciation and amortization, 3.9 million of amortization of debt discount and issuance costs, and 1.1 million of right-of-use assets. These amounts were offset by a decrease of 14.6 million to deferred income taxes, and a decrease in other non-cash items of 0.2 million. Working capital sources of cash included a net increase of 40.5 million in deferred revenue and accounts receivable resulting from the seasonality of our business where a significant number of our customer agreements occur in the second and third quarter each year, with a significant portion of our cash collections taking place in the third quarter. Prepaid expenses and other current assets increased by 26.0 million, while accounts payable and accrued liabilities increased by 3.0 million, lease liabilities decreased by 2.0 million, other liabilities decreased by 2.3 million, and deferred commissions increased by 1.2 million.

Prepaid expenses and other current assets decreased by 15.3 million, while accounts payable and accrued liabilities decreased by 7.6 million, lease liabilities decreased by 5.4 million, other liabilities increased by 2.5 million, deferred commissions decreased by 2.9 million, and right-of-use assets decreased by 3.3 million. 
 Investing Activities 
 Our investing activities have consisted primarily of business acquisitions, property and equipment purchases for computer-related equipment and capitalization of software development costs. Capitalized software development costs are related to new applications or improvements to our existing software platform that expand the functionality for our customers. 
 Net cash used in investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 907.7 million, consisting of purchases of property and equipment of 6.2 million and business acquisitions, net of cash received, of 822.6 million related to the acquisition of Parchment and 78.9 million related to the acquisition of Scribbles. 
 Net cash used in investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was 4.7 million, consisting of purchases of property and equipment of 4.7 million. 
 Financing Activities 
 Our financing activities have consisted of proceeds from issuance of common stock from employee equity plans, shares withheld for tax withholdings on vesting of RSUs, borrowings and repayments of long-term debt, and changes in customer fund deposits. 
 Net cash provided by financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 663.0 million, which consisted of borrowings under the 2023 Incremental Term Loans, net of discount, of 663.9 million, borrowings under the Senior Revolver of 70.0 million, repayment of borrowing under the Senior Revolver of 70.0 million, 6.0 million in proceeds from the issuance of common stock from the employee stock purchase plan, and 6.4 million increase in customer fund deposits, offset by 4.3 million of shares repurchased for tax withholdings on vesting of RSUs, and 9.0 million in repayments on long-term debt. 
 Net cash used in financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was 2.8 million, which consisted of 6.0 million in proceeds from the issuance of common stock from employee equity plans, offset by 4.9 million of shares repurchased for tax withholdings on vesting of RSUs, 0.1 million of financing costs, and 3.8 million in payments on long-term debt. 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 Our condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States U.S. GAAP ). The preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs and expenses, and related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.

 Recent Accounting Pronouncement 
 For information on recent accounting pronouncements, see Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Recent Accounting Pronouncements in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 In addition to our results determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, we believe the following non-GAAP measures are useful in evaluating our operating performance and liquidity. We believe that non-GAAP financial information, when taken collectively, may be helpful to investors because it provides consistency and comparability with past financial performance and assists in comparisons with other companies, some of which use similar non-GAAP financial information to supplement their U.S. GAAP results. The non-GAAP financial information is presented for supplemental informational purposes only and should not be considered a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may be different from similarly-titled non-GAAP measures used by other companies. A reconciliation is provided below for each non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable financial measure stated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Investors are encouraged to review the related U.S. GAAP financial measures and the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures. 
 
 Non-GAAP Operating Income 
 We define non-GAAP operating income as loss from operations excluding the impact of stock-based compensation, transaction costs, globalization costs, restructuring costs, technology modernization costs, other non-recurring costs, and amortization of acquisition-related intangibles that we do not believe are reflective of our ongoing operations. We believe non-GAAP operating income is useful in evaluating our operating performance compared to that of other companies in our industry, as this metric generally eliminates the effects of certain items that may vary for different companies for reasons unrelated to overall operating performance. Although we exclude the amortization of acquisition-related intangibles from this non-GAAP measure, management believes it is important for investors to understand that such intangible assets were recorded as part of purchase accounting and contribute to revenue generation. 
 The following table provides a reconciliation of loss from operations to non-GAAP operating income for each of the periods indicated:

Free Cash Flow 
 We define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment and intangible assets, net of proceeds from disposals of property and equipment. We believe free cash flow facilitates period-to-period comparisons of liquidity. We consider free cash flow to be an important measure because it measures the amount of cash we generate and reflects changes in working capital. We use free cash flow in conjunction with traditional U.S. GAAP measures as part of our overall assessment of our liquidity, including the preparation of our annual operating budget and quarterly forecasts, to evaluate the effectiveness of our business strategies, and to communicate with our board of directors concerning our liquidity. 
 The following table provides a reconciliation of net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow for each of the periods indicated:

Adjusted EBITDA 
 EBITDA is defined as earnings before debt-related costs, including interest and loss on debt extinguishment, benefit for taxes, depreciation, and amortization. We further adjust EBITDA to exclude certain items of a significant or unusual nature, including stock-based compensation, transaction costs, globalization costs, restructuring costs, technology modernization costs, other non-recurring costs, effects of foreign currency transaction losses, amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, and interest income. Although we exclude the amortization of acquisition-related intangibles from this non-GAAP measure, management believes that it is important for investors to understand that such intangible assets were recorded as part of purchase accounting and contribute to revenue generation. 
 We believe that adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management team and board of directors. In addition, it provides a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of our business, as it removes the effect of certain non-cash expenses and certain variable charges. 
 Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as a financial measure, should be considered as supplemental in nature, and is not meant as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

Forward-Looking Statements 
 This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ). Forward-looking statements are based on our management s beliefs and assumptions and on information currently available to our management. All statements other than statements of historical facts are forward-looking statements for purposes of these provisions, including those relating to future events or our future financial performance and financial guidance. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as may, might, will, should, expect, plan, anticipate, project, believe, estimate, predict, potential, intend or continue, the negative of terms like these or other comparable terminology, and other words or terms of similar meaning in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance. For example, all statements we make relating to our current expectations relating to the Merger and the transactions, contemplated by the Merger agreement, estimated and projected costs, expenditures, cash flows, growth rates and financial results, our plans and objectives for future operations, growth initiatives, or strategies, industry, market and macroeconomic expectations, or future business and product capabilities are forward-looking statements. These statements are only predictions. You should not place undue reliance on our forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to future events, risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control, or currently unknown to us. Our assumptions may turn out to be inaccurate and cause actual events or results to differ materially from our expectation or projections. All forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those that we expected, including: 
 the risk that the proposed Merger may not be completed in a timely manner or at all, which may adversely affect the Company s business and the price of the common stock; 

the occurrence of any event, change or other circumstance or condition that could give rise to the termination of the Merger Agreement, including in circumstances requiring the Company to pay a termination fee; 

the ability of Parent and Merger Sub to obtain the necessary financing arrangements set forth in the commitment letters received in connection with the Merger; 

the effects or outcomes of litigation relating to the Merger instituted against the parties to the Merger Agreement or their respective directors, managers or officers; 

certain restrictions during the pendency of the Merger that may impact the Company s ability to pursue certain business opportunities or strategic transactions; 

uncertainty as to timing of completion of the Merger; 

risks that the benefits of the Merger are not realized when and as expected; 

the continued economic uncertainty, including persistent inflation, labor shortages, high interest rates, foreign currency exchange volatility, concerns of economic slowdown or recession, reduced spending or suspension of investment in new or enhanced projects and geopolitical instability; 

risks associated with failing to continue our recent growth rates, including our ability to acquire new customers and successfully retain existing customers; 

the effects of the increased usage of, or interruptions or performance problems associated with, our learning platform; 

the impact on our business by health pandemics or epidemics; 

the history of losses and expectation that we will not be profitable for the foreseeable future;

the impact to our revenues and operating results if we are unable to acquire new customers, successfully retain existing customers, expand sales to existing customers or develop new products; 

our ability to grow our business effectively, to scale our business and to manage our expenses; 

risks and uncertainties associated with potential acquisitions; 

the competitiveness of the market in which we operate; 

our reliance on our management team and other key employees; 

risks related our brand recognition and reputation; 

the impact of potential information technology or data security breaches or other cyberattacks or other disruptions; 

risks associated with our use of open source software, including that we make a substantial portion of the source code for Canvas available under the terms of an open source license; 

our ability to obtain, maintain, protect and enforce our intellectual property and proprietary rights; 

our ability to comply with regulations applicable to us; 

risks related to our estimates of market opportunity and our ability to change our pricing models, if necessary to compete successfully; and; 

other factors disclosed in the section entitled Risk Factors in the 2023 10-K. 

We derive many of our forward-looking statements from our operating budgets and forecasts, which are based on many detailed assumptions. While we believe that our assumptions are reasonable, we caution that it is very difficult to predict the impact of known factors, and it is impossible for us to anticipate all factors that could affect our actual results. All written and oral forward-looking statements attributable to us, or persons acting on our behalf, are expressly qualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement as well as other cautionary statements that are made from time to time in our other SEC filings and public communications. You should evaluate all forward-looking statements made in this report in the context of these risks and uncertainties. 
 We caution you that the important factors referenced above may not contain all of the factors that are important to you. In addition, we cannot assure you that we will realize the results or developments we expect or anticipate or, even if substantially realized, that they will result in the consequences or affect us or our operations in the way we expect. The forward-looking statements included in this report are made only as of the date hereof. We undertake no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as otherwise required by law. 
 Item 3.	Quantitative and Qualitat ive Disclosures About Market Risk 
 We are exposed to market risk in the ordinary course of our business. Market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates. Our market risk exposure is primarily a result of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates and inflation. We do not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. 
 Foreign Currency Exchange Risk 
 Our reporting currency is the U.S. dollar. Due to our international operations, we have foreign currency risks related to operating expense denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, particularly the euro. Most of our sales are denominated in U.S. dollars, and therefore our revenue is not currently subject to significant foreign currency risk. Our operating expenses are denominated in the currencies of the countries in which our operations are located, which are primarily in the United States, Europe, Australia, and New Zealand. Our condensed consolidated results of operations and cash flows are, therefore, subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and may be adversely affected in the future due to changes in foreign exchange rates. To date, we have not entered into any hedging arrangements with respect to foreign currency risk or other derivative financial instruments. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, a hypothetical 10 change in foreign currency exchange rates applicable to our business would not have had a material impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 38 

Table of Contents 

Interest Rate Risk 
 We had cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and funds held on behalf of customers of 203.2 million and 344.2 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, consisting of cash and money market accounts in highly rated financial institutions. With the exception of cash, these interest-earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk. To date, fluctuations in our interest income have not been significant. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes and have not used any derivative financial instruments to manage our interest rate risk exposure. Due to the short-term nature of these investments, we have not been exposed to, nor do we anticipate being exposed to, material risks due to changes in interest rates. 
 At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we also had in place a 125.0 million Senior Revolver and approximately 1,167.3 million and 491.3 million outstanding on our Senior Term Loan and 2023 Incremental Term Loans, respectively. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had no outstanding borrowings under our Senior Revolver. The Senior Revolver bears interest at 2.5 plus a variable applicable rate, whereas the Senior Term Loan and 2023 Incremental Term Loans bear interest at 2.75 plus a variable applicable rate. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the applicable rate for the Senior Term Loan and 2023 Incremental Term Loans was 8.07 and 8.68 , respectively. 
 We have an agreement to maintain cash balances at a financial institution of no less than 1.0 million as collateral for several letters of credit for the purpose of securing certain of the Company s obligations under facility leases. 
 Item 4.	Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures . Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, have evaluated our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, our disclosure controls and procedures were designed to, and were effective to, provide assurance at a reasonable level that the information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. 
 Changes in internal control over financial reporting . There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 Inherent limitation on the effectiveness of internal control . The effectiveness of any system of internal control over financial reporting, including ours, is subject to inherent limitations, including the exercise of judgment in designing, implementing, operating, and evaluating the controls and procedures, and the inability to eliminate misconduct completely. Accordingly, any system of internal control over financial reporting, including ours, no matter how well designed and operated, can only provide reasonable, not absolute assurances. In addition, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. We intend to continue to monitor and upgrade our internal controls as necessary or appropriate for our business but cannot assure you that such improvements will be sufficient to provide us with effective internal control over financial reporting.

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 
 Item 1.	Legal Proceedings 
 We are, and from time to time may be, party to litigation and subject to claims. As our growth continues, we may become party to an increasing number of litigation matters and claims. The outcome of litigation and claims cannot be predicted with certainty, and the resolution of these matters could materially affect our future results of operations, cash flows or financial position. For a description of our material legal proceedings, see Note 14, Commitments and Contingencies in the financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 Item 1A.	R isk Factors 
 A discussion of the material factors that make an investment in us risky is included in the section entitled Risk Factors included in our 2023 10-K and set forth below. 
 Uncertainties associated with the Merger could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
 On July 25, 2024, Instructure entered into the Merger Agreement. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub will be merged with and into the Company, with the Company surviving as a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent. 
 The closing of the Merger is subject to certain conditions, including (i) certain approvals and clearances by government authorities and (iii) other customary conditions for a transaction of this type, such as the absence of any legal restraint prohibiting the consummation of the transactions and the absence of any Company Material Adverse Effect (as defined in the Merger Agreement). Even though effective as of 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on September 9, 2024, the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, expired with respect to the Merger, there are other regulatory agencies from which certain regulatory approvals and clearances will be sought. These agencies have broad discretion in administering the governing regulations. As a condition to their clearance of the Merger, agencies may impose requirements, limitations or costs or require divestitures or place restrictions on the conduct of the parties business. These requirements, limitations, costs, divestitures or restrictions could jeopardize or delay the consummation of the Merger. The parties to the Merger Agreement may not receive the necessary approvals for the transaction or receive them within the expected timeframe. In addition, the Merger may fail to close for other reasons. 
 The announcement and pendency of the Merger, as well as any delays in the expected timeframe, could cause disruption in and create uncertainties, which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition, regardless of whether the Merger is completed. These risks include, but are not limited to: 
 an adverse effect on our relationship with vendors, customers, and employees, including if our vendors, customers or others attempt to negotiate changes in existing business relationships, consider entering into business relationships with parties other than us, delay or defer decisions concerning their business with us, or terminate their existing business relationships with us during the pendency of the Merger; 

a diversion of a significant amount of management time and resources towards the completion of the Merger; 

being subject to certain restrictions on the conduct of our business; 

possibly foregoing certain business opportunities that we might otherwise pursue absent the pending Merger; and 

difficulties attracting and retaining key employees. 

Failure to complete the Merger could adversely affect our business and the market price of our shares of common stock. 
 The closing of the Merger may not occur on the expected timeline or at all. The Merger Agreement contains certain termination rights for us and Parent, including, among others (i) if the Merger is not consummated by 11:59 p.m., New York City time, on March 25, 2025 (the Termination Date ), (ii) if the other party breaches its representations, warranties or covenants in a manner that would cause certain conditions to the closing set forth in the Merger Agreement to not be satisfied and fails to timely cure such breach within the period provided by the terms of the Merger Agreement, or (iii) if any judgment, law or order prohibiting the Merger has become final and non-appealable. 
 If the Merger Agreement is terminated and the Merger is not consummated, the price of our common stock may decline and you may not recover your investment or receive a price for your shares similar to what has been offered pursuant to the Merger. In addition, if the Merger Agreement is validly terminated by Parent under certain circumstances set forth in the Merger Agreement, the Company will be required to pay Parent a termination fee equal to 109.0 million. If the Company is required to pay this termination fee, such fee, together with costs incurred to execute the Merger Agreement and pursue the Merger, could have a material adverse effect on the Company s financial condition and results of operations.

Table of Contents 

The Merger Agreement contains provisions that limit our ability to pursue alternatives to the Merger. 
 Under the Merger Agreement, we are restricted from soliciting, initiating, proposing or encouraging or facilitating alternative acquisition proposals from third parties and/or, subject to certain exceptions set forth in the Merger Agreement, providing non-public information to third parties in response to any inquiries regarding, or the submission of any proposal or offer that constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal (as defined in the Merger Agreement). These provisions could discourage a third party that may have an interest in acquiring all or a significant part of our business from considering or proposing that acquisition, even if such third party were prepared to pay consideration with a higher value than the value of the consideration in the Merger. 
 We are subject to certain restrictions on the conduct of our business under the terms of the Merger Agreement. 
 Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, we have agreed to certain restrictions on the operations of our business. We have agreed to limit the conduct of our business to those actions undertaken in the ordinary course of business and to refrain from, among other things, incurring debt; entering into, adopting, amending, modifying or terminating any material Employee Plans (as defined in the Merger Agreement); increasing the compensation of any director, officer or employee or hiring or terminating any employee (other than for cause); settling certain legal proceedings; changing our methods, principles or practices of financial accounting; and incurring certain capital expenditures, in each case, subject to certain exceptions set forth in the Merger Agreement. Because of these restrictions, we may be prevented from undertaking certain actions with respect to the conduct of our business that we might otherwise have taken if not for the Merger Agreement. 
 Lawsuits filed against us and the members of our Board of Directors arising out of the Merger may delay or prevent the consummation of the Merger. 
 Putative stockholder complaints, including stockholder class action complaints, and other complaints filed against us, our Board of Directors, parties involved in the Merger and others in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement may delay or prevent the consummation of the Merger. The Company has received two complaints by purported stockholders of the Company filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery seeking to compel inspection of books and records related to the Merger. We are currently unable to predict the outcome of this matter. It is possible that additional complaints may be filed challenging the actions of our Board of Directors or challenging the Merger. The outcome of any such complaints or any litigation is uncertain, and we may not be successful in defending against these claims or any such future claims. Whether or not any claims are successful, this type of litigation could delay or prevent the Merger, divert the attention of our management and employees from our day-to-day business, and otherwise adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Additionally, if a plaintiff is successful in obtaining an injunction prohibiting completion of the Merger, then that injunction may delay or prevent the Merger from being completed, which may exacerbate the other risks described herein and adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.
