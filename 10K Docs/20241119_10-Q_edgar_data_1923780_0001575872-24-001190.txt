Going Concern

The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had a working capital deficit of and net cash provided by operating activities of for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The Company may not have adequate liquidity to remain solvent and settle its obligations when payment become due; these factors gave rise to substantial doubt that the Company would continue as a going concern. Management is closely monitoring its financial position, especially its working capital and cash position, as well as its gross profit margins where its positive results of operations will allow the Company to continue as going concern. The company s foremost plan is to boost revenue and improve profitability. These financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainly.

and were recognized as revenue from unearned revenue during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

The Company accounts for income taxes using an asset and liability approach which allows for the recognition and measurement of deferred tax assets based upon the likelihood of realization of tax benefits in future years. Under the asset and liability approach, deferred taxes are provided for the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. A valuation allowance is provided for deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that these items will either expire before the Company is able to realize their benefits, or that future deductibility is uncertain.

Under ASC 740, a tax position is recognized as a benefit only if it is more likely than not that the tax position would be sustained in a tax examination, with a tax examination being presumed to occur. The evaluation of a tax position is a two-step process. The first step is to determine whether it is more-likely-than-not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination, including the resolution of any related appeals or litigations based on the technical merits of that position. The second step is to measure a tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not threshold to determine the amount of benefit to be recognized in the financial statements. A tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Tax positions that previously failed to meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold should be recognized in the first subsequent period in which the threshold is met. Previously recognized tax positions that no longer meet the more-likely-than-not criteria should be de-recognized in the first subsequent financial reporting period in which the threshold is no longer met. Penalties and interest incurred related to underpayment of income tax are classified as income tax expense in the year incurred. GAAP also provides guidance on de-recognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosures and transition.

On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act was enacted by the U.S. government which included a wide range of tax reform affecting businesses including the corporate tax rates, international tax provisions, tax credits and deduction with majority of the tax provision effective after December 31, 2017. Certain activities conducted in foreign jurisdictions may result in the imposition of U.S. corporate income taxes on the Company when its subsidiaries, controlled foreign corporations CFCs ), generate income that is subject to Subpart F or GILTI under the U.S. Internal Revenue Code beginning after December 31, 2017.

The Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economy Security (CARES) Act the CARES Act, H.R. 748 was signed into law on 27 March 2020. The CARES Act temporarily eliminates the taxable income limitation (as enacted under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017) for NOL deductions for 2018-2020 tax years and reinstated NOL carry backs for the 2018-2020 tax years. Moreover, the CARES Act also temporarily increases the business interest deduction limitations from to of adjusted taxable income for the 2019 and 2020 taxable year. Lastly, the Tax Act technical correction classifies qualified improvement property as 15-year recovery period, allowing the bonus depreciation deduction to be claimed for such property retroactively as if it was included in the Tax Act at the time of enactment. The Company does not anticipate a material impact on its financial statements as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 due to the recent enactment.

Two-tier Profits Tax Rates

The two-tier profits tax rates system was introduced under the Inland Revenue (Amendment)(No.3) Ordinance 2018 (the Ordinance of Hong Kong became effective for the assessment year 2018/2019. Under the two-tier profit tax rates regime, the profits tax rate for the first HKD million (approximately of assessable profits of a corporation will be subject to the lowered tax rate, while the remaining assessable profits will be subject to the legacy tax rate, . The Ordinance only allows one entity within a group of connected entities is eligible for the two-tier tax rate benefit. An entity is a connected entity of another entity if (1) one of them has control over the other; (2) both of them are under the control (more than of the issued share capital) of the same entity; (3) in the case of the first entity being a natural person carrying on a sole proprietorship business-the other entity is the same person carrying on another sole proprietorship business. Since Benchwick is wholly owned and under the control of Northann, it is a connected entity. Under the Ordinance, it is an entity s election to nominate the entity that will be subject to the two-tier profits tax rates on its profits tax return. The election is irrevocable. The Company elected Benchwick to be subject to the two-tier profits tax rates.

The provision for current income and deferred taxes of Benchwick has been calculated by applying the new tax rate of .

Basis of presentation

The condensed financial information reflects the accounts of the Company. The condensed financial information should be read in connection with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto. The condensed financial information is presented as if the incorporation of the Company were in effect since January 1, 2020, and throughout the four years ended December 31, 2024.

(ii)

Restricted Net Assets

Schedule I of Rule 5-04 of Regulation S-X requires the condensed financial information of registrant shall be filed when the restricted net assets of consolidated subsidiaries exceed 25 percent of consolidated net assets as of the end of the most recently completed fiscal year. For purposes of the above test, restricted net assets of consolidated subsidiaries shall mean that amount of the registrant s proportionate share of net assets of consolidated subsidiaries (after intercompany eliminations) which as of the end of the most recent fiscal year may not be transferred to the parent company by subsidiaries in the form of loans, advances or cash dividends without the consent of a third party (i.e., lender, regulatory agency, foreign government, etc.). The Company s only assets are its equity interests in its subsidiaries. Unrestricted net assets are held in the Company s subsidiaries located in the US and Hong Kong. The Company does maintain substantial assets and operating subsidiaries in China; therefore, the ability for operating subsidiaries to pay dividends or transfer assets to the Company may be restricted due to the foreign exchange control policies and availability of cash balances of the Chinese operating subsidiaries.

As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, there were no material contingencies, significant provisions of long-term obligations, mandatory dividend or redemption requirements of redeemable stocks or guarantees of the Company, except for those which have been separately disclosed in the Consolidated Financial Statements, if any.

If it determines that its cash requirements exceed its amounts of cash on hand or if it decides to further optimize its capital structure, it may seek to issue additional debt or equity securities or obtain credit facilities or other sources of funding.
