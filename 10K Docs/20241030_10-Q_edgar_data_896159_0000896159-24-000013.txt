 million in cash. We recognized goodwill of million and intangible assets of million from this acquisition. Chubb has been the exclusive underwriter of Healthy Paws since 2013. The transaction positions Chubb to expand in a niche market with substantial growth potential. This business is assigned to the North America Commercial Insurance segment. 
 
 Huatai Group 
 Huatai Insurance Group Co., Ltd. (Huatai Group) is a Chinese financial services holding company and the parent company of, among others, Huatai Property Casualty Insurance Co., Ltd. (Huatai P C), Huatai Life Insurance Co., Ltd. (Huatai Life), Huatai Asset Management Co., Ltd., and Huatai Baoxing Fund Management Co., Ltd., of which Huatai Group owns 100 percent, 80 percent, 91 percent, and 85 percent, respectively (collectively, Huatai). 
 
 On July 1, 2023, Chubb increased ownership interest from approximately percent to approximately percent. At that time, Chubb discontinued the equity method of accounting and applied consolidation accounting. Refer to Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2023 Form 10-K for additional information. 
 
 In the first quarter of 2024, we closed on incremental ownership interests of approximately percent for million, million of which was paid prior to 2024, and million of which was paid in 2024. Our aggregate ownership interest in Huatai Group was approximately percent as of September 30, 2024. In the fourth quarter of 2024, we entered into an agreement to purchase approximately percent of incremental ownership interests. Chubb has total outstanding agreements for approximately percent of incremental ownership interests, pending completion of certain closing conditions. 
 
 The acquisition of a controlling majority interest in Huatai Group on July 1, 2023, generated million of Goodwill, attributable to expected growth and profitability, and million of Other intangible assets. None of the goodwill is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes. Additionally, the acquisition generated million of Value of business acquired (VOBA). Chubb financed the transaction through available cash on hand. Direct costs related to the acquisition are immaterial, and were expensed as incurred. These include one-time costs that are directly attributable to third-party consulting fees and other professional and legal fees related to the acquisition.

 At September 30, 2024, the tax benefit on certain unrealized losses in our investment portfolio was reduced by a valuation allowance of million necessary due to limitations on the utilization of these losses. As part of evaluating whether it was more likely than not that we could realize these losses, we considered realized gains, carryback ability and available tax planning strategies.

 f) Variable interest entities (VIEs) 
 Consolidated VIEs 
 Certain subsidiaries of Huatai Group are the investment manager of, and maintain investments in, sponsored investment products that are considered VIEs. We have determined that we are the primary beneficiary and consolidate these investment products if we hold at least 10 percent ownership. Refer to Note 1 g) of our 2023 Form 10-K for further information on our consolidation criteria. The assets of these VIEs are not available to our creditors, and the investors in these VIEs have no recourse to Chubb in excess of the assets contained within the VIEs. Our economic exposures are limited to our investments based on our ownership interest in these VIEs. Our total exposure to these consolidated investment products represents the value of our economic ownership interest. 
 Unconsolidated VIEs 
 We do not consolidate sponsored investment products where we have determined that we are not the primary beneficiary. The carrying value of these investments at September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, was million and million, respectively, and our maximum risk of loss approximates the carrying amount. These investments are classified within Equity securities on the Consolidated balance sheets.

We categorize financial instruments within the valuation hierarchy at the balance sheet date based upon the lowest level of inputs that are significant to the fair value measurement. 
 
 We use pricing services to obtain fair value measurements for the majority of our investment securities. Based on management s understanding of the methodologies used, these pricing services only produce an estimate of fair value if there is observable market information that would allow them to make a fair value estimate. Based on our understanding of the market inputs used by the pricing services, all applicable investments have been valued in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We do not adjust prices obtained from pricing services. The following is a description of the valuation techniques and inputs used to determine fair values for financial instruments carried at fair value, as well as the general classification of such financial instruments pursuant to the valuation hierarchy. 
 
 Fixed maturities 
 We use pricing services to estimate fair value measurements for the majority of our fixed maturities. The pricing services use market quotations for fixed maturities that have quoted prices in active markets; such securities are classified within Level 1. For fixed maturities other than U.S. Treasury securities that generally do not trade on a daily basis, the pricing services prepare estimates of fair value measurements using their pricing applications or pricing models, which include available relevant market information, benchmark curves, benchmarking of like securities, sector groupings, and matrix pricing. Additional valuation factors that can be taken into account are nominal spreads, dollar basis, and liquidity adjustments. The pricing services evaluate each asset class based on relevant market and credit information, perceived market movements, and sector news. The market inputs used in the pricing evaluation, listed in the approximate order of priority include: benchmark yields, reported trades, broker/dealer quotes, issuer spreads, two-sided markets, benchmark securities, bids, offers, reference data, and industry and economic events. The extent of the use of each input is dependent on the asset class and the market conditions. Given the asset class, the priority of the use of inputs may change, or some market inputs may not be relevant. Additionally, fixed maturities valuation is more subjective when markets are less liquid due to the lack of market-based inputs (i.e., stale pricing) and may require the use of models to be priced. The lack of market-based inputs may increase the potential that an investment's estimated fair value is not reflective of the price at which an actual transaction would occur. The overwhelming majority of fixed maturities are classified within Level 2 because the most significant inputs used in the pricing techniques are observable. For a small number of fixed maturities, we obtain a single broker quote (typically from a market maker). Due to the disclaimers on the quotes that indicate that the price is indicative only, we include these fair value estimates in Level 3. 
 
 Equity securities 
 Equity securities with active markets are classified within Level 1 as fair values are based on quoted market prices. For equity securities in markets which are less active, fair values are based on market valuations and are classified within Level 2. Equity securities for which pricing is unobservable are classified within Level 3. 
 
 Short-term investments 
 Short-term investments, which comprise securities due to mature within one year of the date of purchase that are traded in active markets, are classified within Level 1 as fair values are based on quoted market prices. Securities such as commercial paper and discount notes are classified within Level 2 because these securities are typically not actively traded due to their approaching maturity, and as such, their cost approximates fair value. Short-term investments for which pricing is unobservable are classified within Level 3. 
 
 Private equities 
 Fair values for Private equities including investments in partially-owned investment companies, investment funds, and limited partnerships are based on their respective NAV and are excluded from the fair value hierarchy table below.

Excluded from the table above are MRB losses of million and million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, reported in the Consolidated statements of operations, relating to the market risk benefits' economic hedge and other net cash flows. There is no reinsurance recoverable associated with our liability for MRB. 
 
 In the third quarter of 2024, we completed a review of policyholder behavior related to annuitizations, partial withdrawals, lapses, and mortality for our variable annuity reinsurance business. These refinements resulted in a net increase of approximately million to the MRB fair value, recognized as a Market risk benefits loss. 
 
 We refreshed our partial withdrawal and annuitization assumptions to include an additional year of experience. The annuitization updates included treaty-based and age-based behavior. 
 We updated the lapse assumptions to include an additional year of experience and refined the lapse rates for policies with guaranteed values far in excess of their account values. 
 We updated the mortality assumptions to include an additional year of experience.

 billion and million, respectively, of percent senior notes due March 2034. The percent senior notes due March 2034 constitute a single series of notes with an aggregate principal amount of billion. 
 
 On July 31, 2024, Chubb INA issued million of percent senior notes due August 2029. 
 
 These senior unsecured notes are guaranteed on a senior basis by Chubb Limited and they rank equally with all of Chubb INA's other senior obligations. They also contain customary limitations on lien provisions as well as customary events of default provisions which, if breached, could result in the accelerated maturity of such senior debt. These senior notes are redeemable at any time at Chubb INA's option subject to a make-whole premium (the present value of the remaining principal and interest discounted at the applicable comparable government bond rate plus percent). The notes are also redeemable at par plus accrued and unpaid interest in the event of certain changes in tax law. These notes do not have the benefit of any sinking fund.

 At September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, net derivative liabilities of million and million, respectively, included in the table above were subject to a master netting agreement. The remaining derivatives included in the table above were not subject to a master netting agreement. 
 
 b) Hedge accounting 
 We designate certain derivatives as fair value hedges and net investment hedges for accounting purposes to hedge for foreign currency exposure associated with portions of our euro denominated debt and the net investment in certain foreign subsidiaries, respectively. These derivatives comprise cross-currency swaps, which are agreements under which two counterparties exchange interest payments and principal denominated in different currencies at a future date. These hedges have been and are expected to be highly effective. 
 
 (i) Cross-currency swaps - fair value hedges 
 Chubb holds certain cross-currency swaps designated as fair value hedges. The objective of these cross-currency swaps is to hedge the foreign currency risk on billion, or approximately billion at September 30, 2024, of euro denominated debt by converting cash flows back into the U.S. dollar. 
 
 These hedges are carried at fair value, with changes in fair value recorded in Other comprehensive income (OCI). The gains or losses on the fair value hedges offsetting the foreign currency remeasurement on the hedged euro denominated senior notes are reclassified from OCI into Net realized gains (losses), and an additional portion is reclassified into Interest expense, as follows:

 (ii) Cross-currency swaps - net investment hedges 
 Chubb holds certain cross-currency swaps designated as net investment hedges. The objective of these cross-currency swaps is to hedge the foreign currency exposure in the net investments of certain foreign subsidiaries by converting cash flows from U.S. dollar to the British pound sterling, Japanese yen, Swiss franc, and Chinese yuan renminbi. The hedged risk is designated as the foreign currency exposure arising between the functional currency of the foreign subsidiary and the functional currency of its parent entity. 
 
 The mark-to-market adjustments for foreign currency changes will remain until the underlying hedge subsidiary is deconsolidated or if hedge accounting is discontinued. 
 
 These net investment hedges are carried at fair value, with changes in fair value recorded in Cumulative translation adjustments (CTA) within OCI, and a portion is reclassified to Interest expense as follows: ) ) ) Interest income reclassified from OCI OCI gain (loss) after reclassifications ) ) ) )

(i) Foreign currency exposure management 
 A foreign currency forward contract (forward) is an agreement between participants to exchange specific currencies at a future date. Chubb uses forwards to minimize the effect of fluctuating foreign currencies as discussed above. 
 
 (ii) Duration management and market exposure 
 Futures 
 Futures contracts give the holder the right and obligation to participate in market movements, determined by the index or underlying security on which the futures contract is based. Settlement is made daily in cash by an amount equal to the change in value of the futures contract times a multiplier that scales the size of the contract. Exchange-traded futures contracts on money market instruments, notes and bonds are used in fixed maturity portfolios to more efficiently manage duration, as substitutes for ownership of the money market instruments, bonds, and notes without significantly increasing the risk in the portfolio. Investments in futures contracts may be made only to the extent that there are assets under management not otherwise committed. 
 
 Exchange-traded equity futures contracts are used to limit exposure to a severe equity market decline, which would cause an increase in expected claims and, therefore, an increase in market risk benefit reserves. 
 
 Options 
 An option contract conveys to the holder the right, but not the obligation, to purchase or sell a specified amount or value of an underlying security at a fixed price. Option contracts are used in our investment portfolio as protection against unexpected shifts in interest rates, which would affect the duration of the fixed maturity portfolio. By using options in the portfolio, the overall interest rate sensitivity of the portfolio can be reduced. Option contracts may also be used as an alternative to futures contracts in the synthetic strategy as described above. 
 
 The price of an option is influenced by the underlying security, level of interest rates, expected volatility, time to expiration, and supply and demand. 
 
 The credit risk associated with the above derivative financial instruments relates to the potential for non-performance by counterparties. Although non-performance is not anticipated, in order to minimize the risk of loss, management monitors the creditworthiness of its counterparties and obtains collateral. The performance of exchange-traded instruments is guaranteed by

 Potential risks exist in our secured borrowing transactions due to market conditions and counterparty exposure. With collateral that we pledge, there is a risk that the collateral may not be returned at the expiration of the agreement. If the counterparty fails to return the collateral, Chubb will have free use of the borrowed funds until our collateral is returned. In addition, we may encounter the risk that Chubb may not be able to renew outstanding borrowings with a new term or with an existing counterparty due to market conditions including a decrease in demand as well as more restrictive terms from banks due to increased regulatory and capital constraints. Should this condition occur, Chubb may seek alternative borrowing sources or reduce borrowings. Additionally, increased margins and collateral requirements due to market conditions would increase our restricted assets as we are required to provide additional collateral to support the transaction. 
 
 e) Fixed maturities 
 At September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, commitments to purchase fixed income securities over the next several years were billion and billion, respectively. 
 
 f) Private equities 
 Private equities in the Consolidated balance sheets are investments in limited partnerships and partially-owned investment companies with a carrying value of billion at September 30, 2024. In connection with these investments, we have commitments that may require funding of up to billion over the next several years. At December 31, 2023, these investments had a carrying value of billion with commitments that could have required funding of up to billion. 
 
 g) Income taxes 
 At September 30, 2024, million of unrecognized tax benefits remain out standing. It is reasonably possible that, over the next twelve months, the amount of unrecognized tax benefits may change resulting from the re-evaluation of unrecognized tax benefits arising from examinations by taxing authorities, settlements, and the lapses of statutes of limitations. With few exceptions, Chubb is no longer subject to income tax examinations for years before 2012 . 
 
 h) Legal proceedings 
 Our insurance subsidiaries are subject to claims litigation involving disputed interpretations of policy coverages and, in some jurisdictions, direct actions by allegedly-injured persons seeking damages from policyholders. These lawsuits, involving claims on policies issued by our subsidiaries which are typical to the insurance industry in general and in the normal course of

 At our May 2024 annual general meeting, our shareholders approved an annual dividend for the following year of up to per share, expected to be paid in four quarterly installments of per share after the general meeting by way of distribution from capital contribution reserves, transferred to free reserves for payment. The Board of Directors (Board) will determine the record and payment dates at which the annual dividend may be paid until the date of 2025 annual general meeting, and is authorized to abstain from distributing a dividend at its discretion.

Increases in Common Shares in treasury are due to open market repurchases of Common Shares and the surrender of Common Shares to satisfy tax withholding obligations in connection with the vesting of restricted stock and the forfeiture of unvested restricted stock. Decreases in Common Shares in treasury are principally due to grants of restricted stock, exercises of stock options, purchases under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP), and share cancellations. At our May 2023 annual general meeting, held on May 17, 2023, our shareholders approved the cancellation of shares purchased under our share repurchase programs during 2022. The capital reduction was subject to publication requirements and became effective in accordance with Swiss law on May 22, 2023. At our May 2024 annual general meeting, held on May 16, 2024, our shareholders approved the cancellation of shares purchased under our share repurchase programs during 2023. The capital reduction was subject to publication requirements and became effective in accordance with Swiss law on May 21, 2024. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, shares were repurchased, shares were canceled, and net shares were issued under employee share-based compensation plans. At September 30, 2024, Common Shares remain in treasury.

 -year vesting period and a -year term. Stock options typically vest in equal annual installments over the respective vesting period, which is also the requisite service period. On February 26, 2024, Chubb granted stock options with a weighted-average grant date fair value of each. The fair value of the options issued is estimated on the grant date using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. 
 
 The Amended 2016 LTIP also permits grants of service-based restricted stock and restricted stock units as well as performance shares and performance stock units. Under the Chubb Deferred Stock Unit Plan, a sub-plan of the Amended 2016 LTIP, eligible participants may defer vested performance stock units and restricted stock units to the extent such awards are U.S.-allocated compensation. 
 
 -year vesting period, based on a graded vesting schedule. Performance shares and performance stock units granted comprise both target and premium awards that cliff vest at the end of a -year performance period based on tangible book value (shareholders' equity less goodwill and intangible assets, net of tax) per share growth and P C combined ratio compared to a defined group of peer companies. Premium awards are subject to an additional vesting provision based on total shareholder return compared to the peer group. Stock and unit awards are principally granted at market close price on the grant date. On February 26, 2024, Chubb granted service-based restricted stock, service-based restricted stock units, performance shares, and performance stock units to employees and officers with a grant date fair value of each. Each service-based restricted stock unit and performance stock unit represents our obligation to deliver to the holder one Common Share upon vesting (or the end of the deferral period, if the unit is under the Chubb Deferred Stock Unit Plan).

 Other income and expense includes net income attributable to our investment in Huatai under the equity method of accounting comprising income of million through June 30, 2023. Effective July 1, 2023, we discontinued the equity method of accounting and include the results of operations of Huatai in our consolidated results. 
 Also included in Other income and expense are gains (losses) from fair value changes in separate account assets that do not qualify for separate account treatment under U.S. GAAP. The offsetting movement in the separate account liabilities is included in Policy benefits in the Consolidated statements of operations. 
 Asset management and performance fee revenue and expense primarily relate to the management of third-party assets by Huatai's asset management business, which is unrelated to Huatai Group's core insurance operations. These revenues and expenses are recognized in the period in which the services are performed and, for certain asset performance fees, to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal will not occur. 
 Certain federal excise and capital taxes incurred as a result of capital management initiatives are included in Other income and expense as these are considered capital transactions and are excluded from underwriting results. Bad debt expense for uncollectible premiums is also included in Other income and expense.

 Financial Highlights for the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 
 
 Net income attributable to Chubb was 2.3 billion compared with 2.0 billion in the prior year period. Net income in the current quarter was driven by strong underwriting results and record net investment income. 
 
 Consolidated net premiums written were 13.8 billion, up 5.5 percent, or 6.6 percent in constant dollars. P C net premiums written increased 5.4 percent, or 6.1 percent in constant dollars, with commercial insurance up 5.1 percent and consumer insurance up 9.4 percent. Life Insurance segment net premiums written increased 6.8 percent, or 10.6 percent in constant dollars. 
 
 Pre-tax net investment income was a record 1.5 billion compared with 1.3 billion in the prior year period, primarily due to strong operating cash flow at higher reinvestment rates on fixed maturities. 
 
 Consolidated net premiums earned were 13.4 billion, up 5.5 percent, or 6.7 percent in constant dollars. 
 
 Total pre-tax and after-tax catastrophe losses, net of reinsurance and including reinstatement premiums, were 765 million (6.4 percentage points of the P C combined ratio) and 629 million, respectively, compared with 670 million (6.0 percentage points of the P C combined ratio) and 544 million, respectively, in the prior year period.

Table of Contents 

Total pre-tax and after-tax favorable prior period development were 244 million and 181 million, respectively, compared with 200 million and 116 million, respectively, in the prior year period. 
 
 The P C combined ratio was 87.7 percent compared with 88.4 percent in the prior year period. The P C current accident year (CAY) combined ratio excluding catastrophe losses was 83.4 percent compared with 84.3 percent in the prior year period. 
 
 Operating cash flow was 4.3 billion compared with 4.7 billion in the prior year period. 
 
 Chubb shareholders' equity increased 4.7 billion in the quarter, primarily from net income attributable to Chubb of 2.3 billion and net unrealized gains on our investment portfolio of 3.3 billion, reflecting the mark-to-market impact of lower interest rates on the fixed-income portfolio, partially offset by total capital returned to shareholders of 782 million. Total capital returned to shareholders comprises share repurchases of 413 million at an average purchase price of 286.18 per share, and dividends of 369 million.

The increase in consolidated net premiums written for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, reflects growth across most product lines driven by strong premium retention, including rate and exposure increases, and strong new business. 
 
 Property and other short-tail lines grew globally due to strong new business and retention, including both rate and exposure increases. 
 Commercial casualty grew globally due to strong retention, including both rate and exposure increases, and strong new business. 
 Financial lines declined due to lower renewal retention, including lower rates, due to a competitive market environment.

 Commercial multiple peril grew due to strong new business and retention, including higher rates and exposure, in North America. 
 Surety grew due to strong new business. 
 Agriculture declined primarily due to lower commodity prices in the current year, partially offset by strong new business and rate in our Agriculture P C business. 
 Personal lines grew globally due to new business and renewal retention, as well as increases in both rate and exposure, in homeowners and excess lines, in addition to growth in auto lines in certain international markets. Growth for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, also benefited from the consolidation of Huatai. 
 Global A H P C grew in Europe and Asia, with Asia partially benefiting from the consolidation of Huatai for the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

Table of Contents 

Net Premiums Earned 
 Net premiums earned for short-duration contracts, typically P C contracts, generally reflect the portion of net premiums written that was recorded as revenues for the period as the exposure periods expire. Net premiums earned for long-duration contracts, typically traditional life contracts, generally are recognized as earned when due from policyholders. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, net premiums earned increased 699 million, up 5.5 percent, or 6.7 percent in constant dollars. P C net premiums earned increased 5.4 percent, or 6.3 percent in constant dollars, comprising growth in commercial insurance and consumer insurance of 5.5 percent and 8.7 percent, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net premiums earned increased 3.4 billion, up 10.2 percent, or 10.9 percent in constant dollars. P C net premiums earned increased 9.0 percent, or 9.4 percent in constant dollars, comprising growth in commercial insurance and consumer insurance of 8.3 percent and 12.5 percent, respectively. 
 
 Catastrophe Losses and Prior Period Development 
 We generally define catastrophe loss events consistent with the definition of the Property Claims Service (PCS) for events in the U.S. and Canada. PCS defines a catastrophe as an event that causes damage of 25 million or more in insured losses and affects a significant number of insureds. For events outside of the U.S. and Canada, we generally use a similar definition. Catastrophe losses are net of reinsurance and include reinstatement premiums, which are additional premiums paid on certain reinsurance agreements in order to reinstate coverage that had been exhausted by loss occurrences. The reinstatement premium amount is typically a pro rata portion of the original ceded premium paid based on how much of the reinsurance limit had been exhausted. 
 
 Prior period development (PPD) arises from changes to loss estimates recognized in the current year that relate to loss events that occurred in previous calendar years and excludes the effect of losses from the development of earned premium from previous accident years. PPD includes adjustments relating to either profit commission reserves or policyholder dividend reserves based on actual claim experience that develops after the policy period ends.

P C Combined Ratio 
 In evaluating our segments, excluding Life Insurance financial performance, we use the P C combined ratio, the loss and loss expense ratio, the policy acquisition cost ratio, and the administrative expense ratio. We calculate these ratios by dividing the respective expense amounts by net premiums earned. We do not calculate these ratios for the Life Insurance segment as we do not use these measures to monitor or manage the business in that segment. The P C combined ratio is determined by adding the loss and loss expense ratio, the policy acquisition cost ratio, and the administrative expense ratio. A P C combined ratio under 100 percent indicates underwriting income, and a combined ratio exceeding 100 percent indicates underwriting loss. 
 
 Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 30 September 30 2024 2023 2024 2023 Combined ratio: Loss and loss expense ratio 63.1 64.0 60.8 60.9 Policy acquisition cost ratio 17.2 16.9 18.0 17.8 Administrative expense ratio 7.4 7.5 8.1 8.1 P C Combined ratio 87.7 88.4 86.9 86.8 Catastrophe losses (6.4) (6.0) (5.5) (5.1) Prior period development 2.1 1.9 2.0 2.0 P C CAY combined ratio excluding catastrophe losses 83.4 84.3 83.4 83.7 
 
 The P C combined ratio and the P C CAY combined ratio excluding catastrophe losses decreased for the three months ended September 30, 2024, reflecting the favorable impact of higher net premiums earned, a higher percentage of net premiums earned from property lines and excess and surplus homeowners, and the contemplation of a higher underwriting gain in MPCI for the current crop year. These factors were partially offset by price changes not keeping pace with loss trends in financial lines. The P C combined ratio also reflects higher catastrophe losses, which were partially offset by higher favorable prior period development. 
 
 The P C combined ratio was relatively flat for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as the favorable factors mentioned above were substantially offset by higher loss trends in certain casualty lines, price changes not keeping pace with loss trends in financial lines, and higher catastrophe losses. 
 
 The P C CAY combined ratio excluding catastrophe losses decreased for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, reflecting the favorable factors mentioned above. 
 
 Policy benefits 
 Policy benefits represent losses on contracts classified as long-duration and generally include accident and supplemental health products, term and whole life products, endowment products, and annuities. Policy benefits include (gains) losses from fair value changes in separate account liabilities that do not qualify for separate account treatment under U.S. GAAP. The offsetting movements of these liabilities are recorded in Other (income) expense in the Consolidated statements of operations. In addition, Policy benefits include the impact on the liabilities from (gains) losses on investment portfolios supporting certain participating policies. The offsetting movements of these liabilities are recorded in Realized gains (losses) in the Consolidated statements of operations. Policy benefits include the results of Huatai Group as of July 1, 2023. Refer to the Life Insurance segment operating results section for further discussion. 
 
 Policy benefits were 1,099 million and 938 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 3,498 million and 2,565 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase in Policy benefits for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, is primarily due to the consolidation of Huatai Group.

Premiums 
 Net premiums written increased 368 million, or 7.2 percent, and 1,115 million, or 7.7 percent, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, reflecting strong new business and retention, including rate and exposure increases. The increase in premiums was across most lines of business, most notably in property and casualty lines. This growth was partially offset by declines in financial lines, reflecting a competitive market environment and lower retention, and planned corrective underwriting actions in Major Accounts primary and excess casualty that adversely impacted growth. 
 
 Net premiums earned increased 375 million, or 7.9 percent, and 1,180 million, or 8.6 percent, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, reflecting the growth in net premiums written described above. 
 
 Combined Ratio 
 The combined ratio increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, reflecting higher catastrophe losses and lower favorable prior period development. 
 
 The CAY combined ratio excluding catastrophe losses decreased for the three months ended September 30, 2024, reflecting a higher percentage of net premiums earned from property lines. The improvement was partially offset by price changes not keeping pace with loss trends in financial lines. The CAY combined ratio excluding catastrophe losses was relatively flat for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, reflecting higher loss trends in certain casualty lines and price changes not keeping pace with loss trends in financial lines, offset by lower loss trends in property lines.

 Catastrophe losses through September 30, 2024 and 2023, were primarily from the following events: 
 2024: Hurricane Helene and flooding in Canada. 
 2023: Hurricane Idalia. 
 Refer to Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for detail on prior period development. 
 
 Premiums 
 Net premiums written increased 91 million and 291 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, primarily reflecting continued growth driven by strong new business. Growth was most notably in property and casualty lines, partially offset by a decrease in financial and specialty lines. The increase for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 included a large one-off structured transaction in the second quarter, which benefited growth by 4.4 percentage points. 
 
 Net premiums earned increased 77 million and 230 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, reflecting the increase in net premiums written described above including the large one-off structured transaction in the second quarter, which was fully earned when written. 
 
 Combined Ratio 
 The combined ratio increased for the three months ended September 30, 2024, primarily reflecting the impact of higher catastrophe losses, partially offset by the impact of favorable prior period development. The combined ratio increased for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily reflecting the impact of higher catastrophe losses and the impact of lower favorable prior period development. 
 
 The CAY combined ratio excluding catastrophe losses decreased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to favorable market conditions in property lines. The improvement also reflects the favorable impact of higher net premiums earned on the administrative expense ratio. The improvement for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was partially offset by the impact of the large structured transaction described above.

Life Insurance 
 
 The Life Insurance segment comprises our international life operations. Effective July 1, 2023, the Life Insurance segment includes 100 percent of the results of Huatai Group's life and asset management business as required under consolidation accounting. We previously included our share of Huatai results based on our equity method investment within Other (income) expense. The Life Insurance segment also includes Chubb Tempest Life Re (Chubb Life Re), and the North American supplemental A H and life business of Combined Insurance.

 Premiums 
 Net premiums written increased 100 million and 750 million, or 149 million and 865 million on a constant-dollar basis, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. 
 
 For our international life operations, net premiums written increased 5.5 percent and 20.8 percent for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to strong growth in North Asia, notably Hong Kong and Taiwan. The increase for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, is also due to the consolidation of Huatai Group's life business, which contributed 15.7 percentage points of growth. 
 
 Net premiums written in our North American Combined Insurance business increased 14.4 percent and 10.5 percent for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, due to growth in its worksite business of 31.7 percent and 27.0 percent, partially offset by the non-renewal of a large program.

respectively, primarily from Taiwan. The increase for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 also reflects the consolidation of Huatai Life business. 
 
 Life Insurance segment income 
 Life Insurance segment income decreased 4 million, but increased 6 million on a constant-dollar basis, for the three months ended September 30, 2024, which was impacted by lower favorable loss reserve development related to our Combined Insurance supplemental A H business and impact of foreign exchange from the Korean Won. Life Insurance segment income increased 42 million, or 65 million on a constant-dollar basis, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, reflecting the growth in premiums described above, as well as higher net investment income from higher assets under management and fixed income yield. 

Corporate 
 
 Corporate results primarily include the results of our non-insurance companies, income and expenses not attributable to reportable segments, and loss and loss expenses of asbestos and environmental (A E) liabilities and certain other non-A E run-off exposures, including molestation. Effective July 1, 2023, 100 percent of Huatai Group s non-insurance operations results, comprising real estate and holding company activity, are included in Corporate.

 Administrative expenses increased 6 million and 20 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, primarily due to increased spending to support growth, including digital growth initiatives. 
 
 Integration expenses principally comprised legal and professional fees and all other costs directly related to the integration activities of the Cigna acquisition. These expenses are one-time in nature and are not related to the on-going business activities of the segments. The Chief Executive Officer does not manage segment results or allocate resources to segments when considering these costs and they are therefore excluded from our definition of segment income.

Net Realized and Unrealized Gains (Losses) 
 We take a long-term view with our investment strategy, and our investment managers manage our investment portfolio to maximize total return within specific guidelines designed to minimize risk. The majority of our investment portfolio is available-for-sale and reported at fair value. 
 
 The effect of market movements on our fixed maturities available-for-sale portfolio impacts Net income (through Net realized gains (losses)) when securities are sold, when we write down an asset, or when we record a change to the valuation allowance for expected credit losses. For a further discussion related to how we assess the valuation allowance for expected credit losses and the related impact on Net income, refer to Note 1 f) to the Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2023 Form 10-K. The effect of market movements on fixed maturities related to consolidated investment products and investments supporting certain participating products in the Huatai portfolio impact Net realized gains (losses). Additionally, Net income is impacted through the reporting of changes in the fair value of public and private equity securities and derivatives, including financial futures, options, and swaps. Changes in unrealized appreciation and depreciation on available-for-sale securities, resulting from the revaluation of securities held, changes in cumulative foreign currency translation adjustment, changes in current discount rate on future policy benefits, changes in instrument-specific credit risk on market risk benefits, unrealized postretirement benefit obligations liability adjustment, and cross-currency swaps designated as hedges for accounting purposes are reported as separate components of Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in Shareholders equity in the Consolidated balance sheets.

 Pre-tax net unrealized gains of 3,459 million and 2,293 million in our investment portfolio for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, were primarily driven by lower interest rates. 
 
 Pre-tax net realized gains of 198 million and 201 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, includes 111 million and 186 million, respectively on fixed maturities, comprising mark-to-market gains on Other investments - fixed maturities, partially offset by losses on sales of fixed income securities. In addition, there were pre-tax net realized gains from mark-to-market gains on public equity securities, partially offset by foreign exchange losses. 

Effective Income Tax Rate 
 Our effective tax rate (ETR) reflects a mix of income or losses in jurisdictions with a wide range of tax rates, permanent differences between U.S. GAAP and local tax laws, and the impact of discrete items. A change in the geographic mix of earnings could impact our ETR. 
 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, our ETR was 16.8 percent and 16.0 percent, respectively, compared to an ETR of 16.8 percent and 17.2 percent, respectively, in the prior year. The ETR for each period was impacted by our mix of earnings among various jurisdictions and by discrete tax items. The nine months ended September 30, 2024 included an incremental deferred tax benefit of 55 million in the first quarter related to the Bermuda tax law enacted in December 2023. 

Non-GAAP Reconciliation 
 
 In presenting our results, we included and discussed certain non-GAAP measures. These non-GAAP measures, which may be defined differently by other companies, are important for an understanding of our overall results of operations and financial condition. However, they should not be viewed as a substitute for measures determined in accordance with GAAP.

Table of Contents 

We provide financial measures, including net premiums written, net premiums earned, segment income, and underwriting income on a constant-dollar basis. We believe it is useful to evaluate the trends in our results exclusive of the effect of fluctuations in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the currencies in which our international business is transacted, as these exchange rates could fluctuate significantly between periods and distort the analysis of trends. The impact is determined by assuming constant foreign exchange rates between periods by translating prior period results using the same local currency exchange rates as the comparable current period. 
 
 P C performance metrics comprise consolidated operating results (including Corporate) and exclude the operating results of the Life Insurance segment. We believe that these measures are useful and meaningful to investors as they are used by management to assess the company s P C operations which are the most economically similar. We exclude the Life Insurance segment because the results of this business do not always correlate with the results of our P C operations. 
 
 P C combined ratio is the sum of the loss and loss expense ratio, policy acquisition cost ratio and the administrative expense ratio excluding the life business and including the realized gains and losses on the crop derivatives. These derivatives were purchased to provide economic benefit, in a manner similar to reinsurance protection, in the event that a significant decline in commodity pricing impacts underwriting results. We view gains and losses on these derivatives as part of the results of our underwriting operations. 
 
 CAY P C combined ratio excluding catastrophe losses (CATs) excludes CATs and prior period development (PPD) from the P C combined ratio. We exclude CATs as they are not predictable as to timing and amount and PPD as these unexpected loss developments on historical reserves are not indicative of our current underwriting performance. The combined ratio numerator is adjusted to exclude CATs, PPD, and expense adjustments on PPD, and the denominator is adjusted to exclude net premiums earned adjustments on PPD and reinstatement premiums on CATs and PPD. In periods where there are adjustments on loss sensitive policies, these adjustments are excluded from PPD and net premiums earned when calculating the ratios. We believe this measure provides a better evaluation of our underwriting performance and enhances the understanding of the trends in our P C business that may be obscured by these items. This measure is commonly reported among our peer companies and allows for a better comparison. 
 
 Reinstatement premiums are additional premiums paid on certain reinsurance agreements in order to reinstate coverage that had been exhausted by loss occurrences. The reinstatement premium amount is typically a pro rata portion of the original ceded premium paid based on how much of the reinsurance limit had been exhausted. 
 
 Net premiums earned adjustments within PPD are adjustments to the initial premium earned on retrospectively rated policies based on actual claim experience that develops after the policy period ends. The premium adjustments correlate to the prior period loss development on these same policies and are fully earned in the period the adjustments are recorded. 
 
 Prior period expense adjustments typically relate to adjustable commission reserves or policyholder dividend reserves based on actual claim experience that develops after the policy period ends. The expense adjustments correlate to the prior period loss development on these same policies.

 Net investment income is influenced by a number of factors including the amounts and timing of inward and outward cash flows, the level of interest rates, and changes in overall asset allocation. Net investment income increased 14.7 percent for the three months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to higher reinvestment rates on fixed maturities. Net investment income increased 22.5 percent for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily reflecting higher reinvestment rates on fixed maturities and the consolidation of Huatai Group. 
 
 For private equities where we own less than three percent, investment income is included within Net investment income in the table above. For private equities where we own more than three percent, investment income is included within Other (income) expense in the Consolidated statements of operations. Excluded from Net investment income is the mark-to-market movement for private equities, which is recorded within either Other (income) expense or Net realized gains (losses) based on our percentage of ownership. The total mark-to-market movement for private equities excluded from Net investment income was as follows: 
 Three Months Ended September 30 Nine Months Ended September 30 (in millions of U.S. dollars) 2024 2023 2024 2023 Total mark-to-market gain on private equity, pre-tax 170 90 357 364 

Interest Expense 
 Interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was 552 million comprising 568 million related to fixed expenses on existing debt obligations and variable expenses, and a 16 million benefit related to the amortization of the fair value of debt assumed in the Chubb Corp acquisition. The variable expenses relate to fees from the usage of certain facilities, including letters of credit, and interest on held collateral and repurchase agreements. Based on projected variable expenses and our existing debt obligations, including the 1.0 billion of 5.00 percent senior notes issued on March 7, 2024, the new 700 million of 4.65 percent senior notes issued on July 31, 2024, and the new 600 million of 5.00 percent senior notes issued on July 31, 2024, we expect pre-tax interest expense to be approximately 200 million for the remainder of 2024, or 768 million for the full year. We also expect a 5 million benefit related to the amortization of the fair value of debt assumed in the Chubb Corp acquisition for the remainder of 2024. For more information on our debt obligations, refer to Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements herein, and Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, under Item 8 in our 2023 Form 10-K.

 Municipal 
 As part of our overall investment strategy, we may invest in states, municipalities, and other political subdivisions fixed maturity securities (Municipal). We apply the same investment selection process described previously to our Municipal investments. The portfolio is highly diversified primarily in state general obligation bonds and essential service revenue bonds including education and utilities (water, power, and sewers). 
 
 Non-U.S. 
 Chubb s local currency investment portfolios have strict contractual investment guidelines requiring managers to maintain a high quality and diversified portfolio to both sector and individual issuers. Investment portfolios are monitored daily to ensure investment manager compliance with portfolio guidelines. 
 
 Our non-U.S. investment grade fixed income portfolios are currency-matched with the insurance liabilities of our non-U.S. operations. The average credit quality of our non-U.S. fixed income securities is A and 39 percent of our holdings are rated AAA or guaranteed by governments or quasi-government agencies. Within the context of these investment portfolios, our government and corporate bond holdings are highly diversified across industries and geographies. Issuer limits are based on credit rating (AA two percent, A one percent, BBB 0.5 percent of the total portfolio) and are monitored daily via an internal compliance system. We manage our indirect exposure using the same credit rating-based investment approach. Accordingly, we do not believe our indirect exposure is material.

 Below-investment grade corporate fixed income portfolio 
 Below-investment grade securities have different characteristics than investment grade corporate debt securities. Risk of loss from default by the borrower is greater with below-investment grade securities. Below-investment grade securities are generally unsecured and are often subordinated to other creditors of the issuer. Also, issuers of below-investment grade securities usually have higher levels of debt and are more sensitive to adverse economic conditions, such as recession or increasing interest rates, than investment grade issuers. At September 30, 2024, our corporate fixed income investment portfolio included below-investment grade and non-rated securities which, in total, comprised approximately 14 percent of our fixed income portfolio. Our below-investment grade and non-rated portfolio includes over 1,600 issuers, with the greatest single exposure being 175 million. 
 
 We manage high-yield bonds as a distinct and separate asset class from investment grade bonds. The allocation to high-yield bonds is explicitly set by internal management and is targeted to securities in the upper tier of credit quality (BB/B). Our minimum rating for initial purchase is BB/B. Fifteen external investment managers are responsible for high-yield security selection and portfolio construction. Our high-yield managers have a conservative approach to credit selection and very low historical default experience. Holdings are highly diversified across industries and generally subject to a 1.5 percent issuer limit

as a percentage of high-yield allocation. We monitor position limits daily through an internal compliance system. Derivative and structured securities (e.g., credit default swaps and collateralized debt obligations) are not permitted in the high-yield portfolio. 

Critical Accounting Estimates 

Unpaid losses and loss expenses 
 As an insurance and reinsurance company, we are required by applicable laws and regulations and U.S. GAAP to establish loss and loss expense reserves for the estimated unpaid portion of the ultimate liability for losses and loss expenses under the terms of our policies and agreements with our insured and reinsured customers. With the exception of certain structured settlements, for which the timing and amount of future claim payments are reliably determinable, and certain reserves for unsettled claims, our loss reserves are not discounted for the time value of money. 
 
 The following table presents a roll-forward of our unpaid losses and loss expenses: 
 (in millions of U.S. dollars) Gross Losses Reinsurance 
 Recoverable (1) 
 Net Losses Balance at December 31, 2023 80,122 17,884 62,238 Losses and loss expenses incurred 24,159 4,618 19,541 Losses and loss expenses paid (19,918) (4,839) (15,079) Other (including foreign exchange translation) (37) (32) (5) Balance at September 30, 2024 84,326 17,631 66,695 
 (1) Net of valuation allowance for uncollectible reinsurance. 
 
 The estimate of the liabilities includes provisions for claims that have been reported but are unpaid at the balance sheet date (case reserves) and for obligations on claims that have been incurred but not reported (IBNR) at the balance sheet date. IBNR may also include provisions to account for the possibility that reported claims may settle for amounts that differ from the established case reserves. Loss reserves also include an estimate of expenses associated with processing and settling unpaid claims (loss expenses). 
 
 Refer to Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion on the changes in the loss reserves. 

Asbestos and Environmental (A E) 
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we increased environmental net loss reserves for Brandywine managed operations by 47 million. A E reserves are included in Corporate. Refer to our 2023 Form 10-K for further information on our A E exposures. 

Fair value measurements 
 Accounting guidance defines fair value as the price to sell an asset or transfer a liability (an exit price) in an orderly transaction between market participants and establishes a three-level valuation hierarchy based on the reliability of the inputs. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets (Level 1 inputs) and the lowest priority to unobservable data (Level 3 inputs). Level 2 includes inputs, other than quoted prices within Level 1, that are observable for assets or liabilities either directly or indirectly. Refer to Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on our fair value measurements.

Catastrophe Management 
 We actively monitor and manage our catastrophe risk accumulation around the world from natural perils, which includes setting risk limits based on probable maximum loss (PML) and purchasing catastrophe reinsurance to ensure sufficient liquidity and capital to meet the expectations of regulators, rating agencies, and policyholders, and to provide shareholders with an appropriate risk-adjusted return. Chubb uses internal and external data together with sophisticated, analytical catastrophe loss and risk modeling techniques to ensure an appropriate understanding of risk, including diversification and correlation effects, across different product lines and territories. The table below presents our modeled pre-tax estimates of natural catastrophe PML, net of reinsurance, at September 30, 2024, and does not represent our expected catastrophe losses for any one year. 
 Modeled Net Probable Maximum Loss (PML) Pre-tax Worldwide (1) 
 U.S. Hurricane (2) 
 California Earthquake (3) 
 Annual Aggregate Annual Aggregate Single Occurrence (in millions of U.S. dollars, except for percentages) Chubb of Total Chubb Shareholders Equity Chubb of Total Chubb Shareholders Equity Chubb of Total Chubb Shareholders Equity 1-in-10 2,862 4.4 1,623 2.5 169 0.3 1-in-100 5,489 8.3 3,786 5.8 1,878 2.9 1-in-250 8,583 13.1 6,109 9.3 2,170 3.3 
 (1) Worldwide aggregate includes modeled losses arising from tropical cyclones, convective storms, earthquakes, wildfires, and inland floods, and excludes "non-modeled" perils such as man-made and other catastrophe risks including pandemic. 
 (2) U.S. hurricane modeled losses include losses from wind, storm-surge, and related precipitation-induced flooding. 
 (3) California earthquake modeled losses include the fire-following sub-peril. 
 
 The PML for worldwide and key U.S. peril regions are based on our in-force portfolio at July 1, 2024, and reflect the September 1, 2024, reinsurance program, as well as inuring reinsurance protection coverage. As of April 1, 2024, we increased retention in North America by 500 million and increased limits by 1.7 billion. On August 31, 2024, a 500 million catastrophe treaty covering named windstorms and earthquakes within Northeast States expired and was not renewed. Refer to the Global Property Catastrophe Reinsurance section for more information. These estimates assume that reinsurance recoverable is fully collectible. 
 
 According to the model, for the 1-in-100 return period scenario, there is a one percent chance that our pre-tax annual aggregate losses incurred in any year from U.S. hurricane events could be in excess of 3,786 million (or 5.8 percent of total Chubb shareholders equity at September 30, 2024). Effective March 31, 2024, our worldwide and U.S. Hurricane PMLs reflect the latest North Atlantic hurricane vulnerability model. 
 
 The above estimates of Chubb s loss profile are inherently uncertain for many reasons, including the following: 
 While the use of third-party modeling packages to simulate potential catastrophe losses is prevalent within the insurance industry, the models are reliant upon significant meteorology, seismology, and engineering assumptions to estimate catastrophe losses. In particular, modeled catastrophe events are not always a representation of actual events and ensuing additional loss potential; 
 There is no universal standard in the preparation of insured data for use in the models, the running of the modeling software, and interpretation of loss output. These loss estimates do not represent our potential maximum exposures and it is highly likely that our actual incurred losses would vary materially from the modeled estimates; 
 The potential effects of climate change add to modeling complexity; and 
 Changing climate conditions could impact our exposure to natural catastrophe risks. Published studies by leading government, academic, and professional organizations combined with extensive research by Chubb climate scientists reveal the potential for increases in the frequency and severity of key natural perils such as tropical cyclones, inland flood, and wildfire. To understand the potential impacts on the Chubb portfolio, we have conducted stress tests on our peak exposure zone, namely in the U.S., using parameters outlined by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Climate Change 2021 report. These parameters consider the impacts of climate change and the resulting climate peril impacts over a timescale relevant to our business. The tests are conducted by adjusting our baseline view of risk for the perils of hurricane, inland flood, and wildfire in the U.S. to reflect increases in frequency and severity across the modeled domains for each of these perils. Based on these tests against the Chubb portfolio we do not expect material impacts to our baseline PMLs from climate change through December 31, 2024. These tests reflect current exposures only and exclude potentially mitigating factors such as changes to building codes, public or private risk mitigation, regulation, and public policy. 
 
 Refer to Item 7 in our 2023 Form 10-K for more information on man-made and other catastrophes.

Global Property Catastrophe Reinsurance Program 
 Chubb s core property catastrophe reinsurance program provides protection against natural catastrophes impacting its primary property operations (i.e., excluding our Global Reinsurance and Life Insurance segments). 
 
 We regularly review our reinsurance protection and corresponding property catastrophe exposures. This may or may not lead to the purchase of additional reinsurance prior to a program s renewal date. In addition, prior to each renewal date, we consider how much, if any, coverage we intend to buy and we may make material changes to the current structure in light of various factors, including modeled PML assessment at various return periods, reinsurance pricing, our risk tolerance and exposures, and various other structuring considerations. 
 
 Chubb renewed its Global Property Catastrophe Reinsurance Program for our North American and International operations effective April 1, 2024, through March 31, 2025. The program consists of three layers in excess of losses retained by Chubb on a per occurrence basis. Chubb renewed its terrorism coverage (excluding nuclear, biological, chemical and radiation coverage, with an inclusion of coverage for biological and chemical coverage for personal lines) for the United States from April 1, 2024, through March 31, 2025, with the same limits and retention and percentage placed except that the majority of terrorism coverage is on an aggregate basis above our retentions without a reinstatement.

 Repurchase agreements are excluded from the table above and are disclosed separately from short-term debt in the Consolidated balance sheets. The repurchase agreements are collateralized borrowings where we maintain the right and ability to redeem the collateral on short notice, unlike short-term debt which comprises the current maturities of our long-term debt instruments. 
 
 On March 7, 2024, Chubb INA Holdings LLC (Chubb INA) issued 1.0 billion of 5.00 percent senior notes due March 2034. Chubb INA's 700 million of 3.35 percent senior notes due May 2024 was paid upon maturity. On July 31, 2024, Chubb INA issued 700 million of 4.65 percent senior notes due August 2029 and 600 million of 5.00 percent senior notes due March 2034. Refer to Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for details about debt issued and debt redeemed. 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we repurchased 1.3 billion of Common Shares in a series of open market transactions under the Board of Directors (Board) share repurchase authorization. At September 30, 2024, there were 16,592,565 Common Shares in treasury with a weighted-average cost of 170.96 per share, and 2.4 billion in share repurchase authorization remained. 
 
 We generally maintain the ability to issue certain classes of debt and equity securities via a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) shelf registration statement which is renewed every three years. This allows us capital market access for refinancing as well as for unforeseen or opportunistic capital needs. On October 3, 2024, we filed a new shelf registration statement which allows us to issue an unlimited amount of certain classes of debt and equity from time to time, replacing the shelf registration statement that was filed in October 2021. This new shelf registration statement expires in October 2027. 
 
 Dividends 
 We have paid dividends each quarter since we became a public company in 1993. Under Swiss law, dividends must be stated in Swiss francs though dividend payments are made by Chubb in U.S. dollars. Refer to Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of our dividend methodology. 
 
 At our May 2024 annual general meeting, our shareholders approved an annual dividend for the following year of up to 3.64 per share, or CHF 3.29 per share, calculated using the USD/CHF exchange rate as published in the Wall Street Journal on May 16, 2024, expected to be paid in four quarterly installments of 0.91 per share after the general meeting by way of a distribution from capital contribution reserves, transferred to free reserves for payment. The Board determines the record and payment dates at which the annual dividend may be paid until the date of the 2025 annual general meeting, and is authorized to abstain from distributing a dividend at its discretion. The annual dividend approved in May 2024 represented a 0.20 per share increase 0.05 per quarter) over the prior year dividend.

The following table represents dividends paid per Common Share to shareholders of record on each of the following dates:

Liquidity 
 We anticipate that positive cash flows from operations (underwriting activities and investment income) should be sufficient to cover cash outflows under most loss scenarios for the near term. In addition to cash from operations, routine sales of investments, and financing arrangements, we have agreements with a third-party bank provider which implemented two international multi-currency notional cash pooling programs to enhance cash management efficiency during periods of short-term timing mismatches between expected inflows and outflows of cash by currency. The programs allow us to optimize investment income by avoiding portfolio disruption. Should the need arise, we generally have access to capital markets and to credit facilities with letter of credit capacity of 4.0 billion, 3.0 billion of which can be used for revolving credit. At September 30, 2024, our usage under these facilities was 887 million in letters of credit. Our access to credit under these facilities is dependent on the ability of the banks that are a party to the facilities to meet their funding commitments. The facilities require that we maintain certain financial covenants, all of which we met at September 30, 2024. Should the existing credit providers on these facilities experience financial difficulty, we may be required to replace credit sources, possibly in a difficult market. If we cannot obtain adequate capital or sources of credit on favorable terms, on a timely basis, or at all, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be adversely affected. To date, we have not experienced difficulty accessing our credit facility or establishing additional facilities when needed. 
 
 The payment of dividends or other statutorily permissible distributions from our operating companies are subject to the laws and regulations applicable to each jurisdiction, as well as the need to maintain capital levels adequate to support the insurance and reinsurance operations, including financial strength ratings issued by independent rating agencies. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we were able to meet all our obligations, including the payments of dividends on our Common Shares, with our net cash flows. 
 
 We assess which subsidiaries to draw dividends from based on a number of factors. Considerations such as regulatory and legal restrictions as well as the subsidiary s financial condition are paramount to the dividend decision. Chubb Limited received dividends of 1.0 billion and 1.4 billion from its Bermuda subsidiaries during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Chubb Limited received cash dividends of nil and 28 million and non-cash dividends of nil and 291 million from Swiss subsidiaries during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Chubb Limited also received dividends of 91 million from its other international subsidiary during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 The U.S. insurance subsidiaries of Chubb INA may pay dividends, without prior regulatory approval, subject to restrictions set out in state law of the subsidiary s domicile (or, if applicable, commercial domicile). Chubb INA s international subsidiaries are also subject to insurance laws and regulations particular to the countries in which the subsidiaries operate. These laws and regulations sometimes include restrictions that limit the amount of dividends payable without prior approval of regulatory insurance authorities. Chubb Limited received no dividends from Chubb INA during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Debt issued by Chubb INA is serviced by statutorily permissible distributions by Chubb INA s insurance subsidiaries to Chubb INA as well as other group resources. Chubb INA received dividends of 1.8 billion and 976 million from its subsidiaries during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 

Cash Flows 
 Our sources of liquidity include cash from operations, routine sales of investments, and financing arrangements. The following is a discussion of our cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 
 Operating cash flows were 11.6 billion in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 9.4 billion in the prior year period, primarily due to higher net investment income and net premiums collected, partially offset by higher net losses paid and income taxes paid. 

89 

Table of Contents 

Cash used for investing was 11.4 billion in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 5.4 billion in the prior year period, an increase of 6.0 billion, which primarily included higher net purchases of fixed maturities and equity securities of 5.5 billion. 
 
 Cash used for financing was 0.1 billion in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 3.3 billion in the prior year period, a decrease of 3.2 billion. This was primarily due to net proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt, net of repayments of 1.6 billion compared with repayments of 475 million in the prior year, and fewer common shares repurchased of 497 million. 
 
 We use repurchase agreements as a low-cost funding alternative. At September 30, 2024, there were 3.0 billion in repurchase agreements outstanding with various maturities over the next nine months. 
 
 Both internal and external forces influence our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. Claim settlements, premium levels, and investment returns may be impacted by changing rates of inflation and other economic conditions. In many cases, significant periods of time, ranging up to several years or more, may lapse between the occurrence of an insured loss, the reporting of the loss to us, and the settlement of the liability for that loss. 

Information provided in connection with outstanding debt of subsidiaries

ITEM 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
 Refer to Item 7A included in our 2023 Form 10-K. 
 
 Foreign currency management 
 As a global company, Chubb entities transact business in multiple currencies. Our policy is to generally match assets, liabilities and required capital for each individual jurisdiction in local currency, which would include the use of derivatives. We occasionally engage in hedging activity for planned cross border transactions. For an estimated impact of foreign currency movement on our net assets denominated in non-U.S. currencies, refer to Item 7A in our 2023 Form 10-K. This information will be updated and disclosed in interim filings if our net assets in non-U.S. currencies change materially from the December 31, 2023, balances disclosed in the 2023 Form 10-K. 
 
 Reinsurance of market risk benefits 
 Chubb views its MRB reinsurance business as having a similar risk profile to that of catastrophe reinsurance, with the probability of long-term economic loss relatively small at the time of pricing. Adverse changes in market factors and policyholder behavior will have an impact on both MRB gains (losses) and net income. When evaluating these risks, we expect to be compensated for taking both the risk of a cumulative long-term economic net loss, as well as the short-term accounting variations caused by these market movements. Therefore, we evaluate this business in terms of its long-term economic risk and reward. 
 
 The tables below are estimates of the sensitivities to instantaneous changes in economic inputs (e.g., equity shock, interest rate shock etc.) at September 30, 2024, for both the fair value of the MRB liability (FVL) and the fair value of specific derivative instruments held (hedge value) to partially offset the risk in the MRB reinsurance portfolio. The following assumptions should be considered when using the below tables: 
 
 Equity shocks impact all global equity markets equally 
 Our liabilities are sensitive to global equity markets in the following proportions: 80 percent 90 percent U.S. equity, and 10 percent 20 percent international equity. 
 Our current hedge portfolio is sensitive only to U.S. equity markets. 
 We would suggest using the S P 500 index as a proxy for U.S. equity, and the MSCI EAFE index as a proxy for international equity. 
 
 Interest rate shocks assume a parallel shift in the U.S. yield curve 
 Our liabilities are also sensitive to global interest rates at various points on the yield curve, mainly the U.S. Treasury curve in the following proportions: up to 15 percent short-term rates (maturing in less than 5 years), 15 percent 30 percent medium-term rates (maturing between 5 years and 10 years, inclusive), and 65 percent 80 percent long-term rates (maturing beyond 10 years).

A change in AA-rated credit spreads impacts the rate used to discount cash flows in the fair value model. AA-rated credit spreads are a proxy for both our own credit spreads and the credit spreads of the ceding insurers. 
 
 The hedge sensitivity is from September 30, 2024, market levels and only applicable to the equity and interest rate sensitivities table below. 
 
 The sensitivities do not scale linearly and may be proportionally greater for larger movements in the market factors. Actual sensitivity of our net income may differ from those disclosed in the tables below due to fluctuations in short-term market movements.

Market Risk Benefits Net Amount at Risk 
 All our MRB reinsurance treaties include annual or aggregate claim limits and many include an aggregate deductible which limit the net amount at risk under these programs. The tables below present the net amount at risk at September 30, 2024, following an immediate change in equity market levels, assuming all global equity markets are impacted equally. 
 
 a) Reinsurance covering the GMDB risk only 
 Equity Shock (in millions of U.S. dollars) +20 Flat -20 -40 -60 -80 GMDB net amount at risk 215 213 349 624 639 520 Claims at 100 immediate mortality 130 137 147 138 127 112 
 
 The treaty limits function as a ceiling as equity markets fall. As the shocks in the table above become incrementally more negative, the impacts begin to drop due to the specific nature of these claim limits, many of which are annual claim limits calculated as a percentage of the reinsured account value. There is also an impact due to a portion of the reinsurance under which claims are positively correlated to equity markets (claims decrease as equity markets fall).

 The treaty limits cause the net amount at risk to increase at a declining rate as equity markets fall. 
 c) Reinsurance covering both the GMDB and GLB risks on the same underlying policyholders 
 Equity Shock (in millions of U.S. dollars) +20 Flat -20 -40 -60 -80 GMDB net amount at risk 35 41 50 60 69 75 GLB net amount at risk 296 366 461 579 695 736 Claims at 100 immediate mortality 26 26 25 25 25 25 
 
 The treaty limits cause the GMDB and GLB net amount at risk to increase at a declining rate as equity markets fall. 
 
 ITEM 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Chubb s management, with the participation of Chubb s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of Chubb s disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as of September 30, 2024. Based upon that evaluation, Chubb s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that Chubb s disclosure controls and procedures are effective in allowing information required to be disclosed in reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to be recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to Chubb s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 Effective July 1, 2023, Chubb discontinued the equity method of accounting to its investment in Huatai Group and applied consolidation accounting. Since the date of consolidation, we have worked to incorporate internal control processes for the consolidated business. 
 There have been no other changes in Chubb's internal controls over financial reporting during the three months ended September 30, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, Chubb's internal controls over financial reporting.
