Development of Business Global Warming Solutions, Inc. Company is an Oklahoma corporation headquartered in California that develops technologies that help mitigate man-made climate change while maintaining a retail operation. The Company was formerly known as Southern Investments, Inc., and was domiciled in Oklahoma. On April 15, 2007, the company changed its name to Global Warming Solutions, Inc., and moved its headquarters to the commonwealth of Canada. In February 2021 we relocated to Temecula, California. The Company was incorporated on March 30, 1999, as Southern Investments, Inc. and has not been in bankruptcy, receivership or any similar proceeding. The Company has never been classified as a shell company. On April 15, 2007, Southern Investments, Inc. acquired all of the issued and outstanding stock of Global Warming Technologies, Inc., an Oklahoma corporation, in exchange for 55,000,000 shares of Southern Investments, Inc. common stock. Following the acquisition, Southern Investments, Inc. changed its name to Global Warming Solutions, Inc and the Company implemented a 1 for 10 reverse stock split of the Company s outstanding common stock that took effect on July 6, 2007. On October 23, 2019, the Company acquired the domain name www.cbd.biz and certain other intangible assets in exchange for a convertible promissory note for 100,000 and began offering hemp-based cannabinoid CBD products through this website. On May 8, 2021, the company ceased all operations relating to CBD sales. The website www.cbd.biz has since been shut down. All operations pertaining to CBD sales have been divested and discontinued. As of September 30, 2024, the Company s total assets are 53,354. These assets are comprised primarily of 2,946 in cash, 4,141 in marketable securities, 6,250 in deposits, 18,928 in other current assets, 10,645 in furniture and equipment, 1,818 in leasehold improvements, and 8,628 in intangible assets, Our independent registered public accounting firm issued its report in connection with the audit of our financial statements for the periods of January 1, 2022, through December 31, 2023, which included an explanatory paragraph in Note 3 describing the existence of conditions that raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Thus far, GWSO management has relied on capital loans and equity investments for the purpose of growing the business. Without continued loans or equity investments, we will not have the necessary capital required to execute our business plan and grow our business. Management has estimated that the costs associated with implementation of its business plan over the next twelve months include, but are not limited to, payroll, consulting, marketing and general administration of 500,000 (which expenses will be satisfied by means other than available cash expenditure, such as, but not limited to, equity or profit-sharing arrangements) and sales. 12 Table of Contents BUSINESS STRATEGY Industry Overview Climate Change Industry Typically, executives manage environmental risk as a threefold problem of I) regulatory compliance, ii) potential liability for industrial accidents, and iii) pollutant release mitigation. But climate change presents business risks that are different in kind because the impact is global, the problem is long-term, and the harm is irreversible. The market for climate change solutions is highly competitive and rapidly evolving, resulting in a dynamic competitive environment with several dominant national and multi-national leaders. The Company will have to compete with established corporations that have greater financial, marketing, technical and human resource capabilities. Such competition may be able to undertake more extensive marketing campaigns, adopt more aggressive distribution policies and make more attractive offers to potential clients. The Company expects competition to persist and intensify in the future. Management believes that there is an increasing demand for money-making ideas created by the warming of our planet and that products and services that slow the flow of greenhouse gases by using less energy or by substituting clean energy for fossil fuels are in great demand. The company s plan is focused on introducing our patented device that stores power, creates oxygen, and produces hydrogen. We will create and sell this product initially focusing on DOD (Department of Defense), and DOE as existing relationships through our partners make these entities the easiest path to market. An initial product and services offering will help meet the growing demand for more efficient and clean energy solutions. Our product is unique in that it can generate electricity from a renewable source, creating oxygen, and producing hydrogen on demand from an electro chemical reaction. We anticipate this product will be in high demand for residential, commercial, and industrial applications. We plan to launch this product and service offering in the markets of the United States and Europe but could increase market share by expanding to markets in Asia and developing countries. We have identified the right personnel and developed a strategy to achieve success. It is the company s belief that profits will begin to be realized once we can begin the manufacturing process. Our company offers a product that generates power, oxygen, and hydrogen on demand. Battery power and hydrogen production are essential to the world because they provide a clean and efficient source of energy. Our battery technology differs in that it is not an accumulator of energy but rather a production unit capable of storing energy through an electrochemical process allowing for easy access when needed. Our unit also produces Hydrogen on demand production, which on the other hand, allows for the storage of energy in a form that can be easily transported to be used elsewhere. Hydrogen can also be used to power vehicles, replacing the need for traditional fossil fuels. Both battery power and hydrogen production provide the world with renewable and clean sources of energy, reducing emissions and helping to combat climate change. The main downside of hydrogen power sources is the difficulty and expense associated with producing, storing, and transporting hydrogen fuel, and the current lack of refueling infrastructure. Hydrogen fuel cells are also expensive compared to other forms of renewable energy, and many of the components used in the production of hydrogen fuel are petroleum-based, making it a less environmentally friendly option. Hydrogen as an energy source can have positive and negative impacts on the planet. On the positive side, hydrogen has the potential to be a clean and renewable energy source, since it can be produced through renewable energy sources and when used in a fuel cell, it only produces water as a byproduct. On the negative side, producing and transporting hydrogen (especially in the preliminary stages of its development) can have significant emissions of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane, which contribute to climate change. Additionally, when produced from non-renewable resources, like natural gas, it might contribute to air pollution and other types of pollution. 13 Table of Contents Our product is an on-demand hydrogen and oxygen generator powered by a battery storage system. It is an advanced technology solution for any user s energy storage and supply needs. This system produces clean hydrogen and oxygen gas on demand, and stores the energy generated in a battery. This stored energy can be used to power vehicles and homes, or other industrial processes; allowing users to be able to make use of the energy whenever and however they need. As an added benefit, the hydrogen and oxygen produced by this device are entirely renewable and free from toxic emissions. This system is both affordable and easy to use, making it an ideal solution for personal, industrial, and commercial needs. The marketing strategy for this product will be focused on building relationships with prime defense contractors and government agencies that are active in the defense industry. Sales staff should work to continually build and strengthen these relationships by providing demonstrations of the product s capabilities, offering customized solutions to fit their needs, and regularly following up on existing contracts. In addition to the direct sales approach, we recommend engaging in other outreach initiatives such as attending trade shows, running media campaigns, and engaging in thought leadership initiatives such as contributing articles or panel discussions at industry events. Through these initiatives, our focus should continue to be on building and reinforcing relationships that can result in government contracts. We can license our technology to the auto industry in a variety of ways. We can offer license agreements with terms and conditions that best fit the needs of our customers. There are several types of license agreements we can consider such as an End-User License Agreement (EULA), a Subscription License Agreement, an Implementation License Agreement, or an Evaluation Agreement. It is important to consider the legal aspects of our technology, such as intellectual property rights and the confidentiality of any data collected, when licensing it to third parties. Additionally, we can provide a range of services, such as support and maintenance, to make sure our licensees have an easy and successful experience with our technology. in our local area, as well as online through our website. Our products will be competitively priced, and we plan to offer customer service and warranties to our customers. Additionally, we will be investing in digital marketing campaigns to reach new customers and increase our brand awareness. Description of Business Our current business strategy is to generate revenue through three basic options: i) consulting fees, ii) royalty fees, and iii) retail sales. Principal Products Currently the company has initiated research and development on Hydrogen Fuel Cell Batteries which they expect to compete directly with the current Lithium-Ion market. Our retail operations will be primarily business to customer, while our consulting and royalty revenues, when earned, will be primarily business to business. Customers There were no customers for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, or year ended December 31, 2023. Patents, Trademarks, Trade Secrets, and Other Intellectual Property To generate revenue from royalties and consulting, we have been developing technologies for future use and development. There are no assurances any of these items currently identified as research and development will materialize or generate revenue for the Company. We have created various formulas and processes we intend to patent and/or copyright for future use and licensing. The following list comprise our intellectual property: Pick-Up-Oil is a proprietary carbon sorbent for oil collection. Under the process, the airborne sorbent is discharged in the oil slick and after absorbing the oil is collected. The product is then extracted from the oil and available for secondary use. Hybrid Electrochemical Energy System is a patented battery system employing advanced manufacturing techniques for solid state electrolytes. With large capacity anode due to special design creating higher specific energy due to air oxygen acting as a depolarizer we expect much quicker charging times and far cheaper manufacturing costs. Growth Strategy We anticipate growth in our operations through normal acceptance of our products, through the licensing of our technologies and intellectual properties, and through acquisitions when deemed in the best interest of our shareholders. 14 Table of Contents Competition The Company competes with other industry participants, including those in global warming products and services. Market and financial conditions, and other conditions beyond the Company s control may make it more attractive for prospective customers to transact business with other entities. Our potential competitors may have greater resources, longer histories, more developed intellectual property, and lower costs of operations. Other companies also may enter into business combinations or alliances that strengthen their competitive positions.

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures As required by Rule 13a-15(b) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e), as of the end of the period covered by this report. Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on this evaluation, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, concluded that as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective. Changes in Internal Control There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 17 Table of Contents PART II OTHER INFORMATION Item 5.
