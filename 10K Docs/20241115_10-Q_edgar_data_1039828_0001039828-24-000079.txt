 In accordance with various regulations, the Company has securities on deposit with regulating authorities with a carrying value of million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, amounts loaned under reverse repurchase agreements were million and , respectively, and the fair value of the collateral received was million and , respectively.

 million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 The unrealized losses at September 30, 2024 are principally related to the timing of the purchases of certain securities, which carry less yield than those available at September 30, 2024. Approximately and of the unrealized losses on fixed maturity securities shown in the above table for September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, are on securities that are rated investment grade, defined as being the highest two NAIC designations. 
 We expect to recover our amortized cost on all securities except for those securities on which we recognized an allowance for credit loss. In addition, because we did not have the intent to sell fixed maturity securities with unrealized losses and it was not more likely than not that we would be required to sell these securities prior to recovery of the amortized cost, which may be maturity, we did not write down these investments to fair value through the Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
 Allowance for Credit Losses 
 Several assumptions and underlying estimates are made in the evaluation of allowance for credit loss. Examples include financial condition, near term and long-term prospects of the issue or issuer, including relevant industry conditions and trends and implications of rating agency actions and offering prices. Based on this evaluation, unrealized losses on available-for-sale securities where an allowance for credit loss was not recorded were concentrated within the financials sector as of September 30, 2024 and the transportation sector as of September 30, 2023.

 Our residential mortgage loan portfolio consists of loans with an amortized cost of billion and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. These loans are collateralized by the related properties and diversified as to location within the United States. 
 Mortgage loans on real estate are generally reported at cost adjusted for amortization of premiums and accrual of discounts, computed using the interest method and net of valuation allowances. Interest income is accrued on the principal amount of the loan based on the loan's contractual interest rate. Interest income is included in Net investment income on our Consolidated Statements of Operations. Accrued interest receivable, which was million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, is included in Accrued investment income on our Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. 
 Loan Valuation Allowance 
 We establish a valuation allowance to provide for the risk of credit losses inherent in our mortgage loan portfolios. The valuation allowance is maintained at a level believed adequate by management to absorb estimated expected credit losses. The valuation allowance is based on amortized cost, which excludes accrued interest receivable. We do not measure a credit loss allowance on accrued interest receivable as we write off any uncollectible accrued interest receivable balances to net investment income in a timely manner. We charged off and million of uncollectible accrued interest receivable on our mortgage loan portfolios for the three and nine months periods ended September 30, 2024, respectively. We did charge off any uncollectible accrued interest receivable on our mortgage loan portfolios for the three and nine months periods ended September 30, 2023, respectively.

There were real estate properties totaling million at September 30, 2024 and real estate properties totaling million at December 31, 2023, in which ownership of the property was taken to satisfy an outstanding loan at December 31, 2023. Recoveries are situations where we have received a payment from the borrower in an amount greater than the carrying value of the loan (principal outstanding less specific allowance). 
 We closely monitor loan performance for our commercial and residential mortgage loan portfolios.

days or more past due. When loans become nonperforming, we place them on non-accrual status and discontinue recognizing interest income. If payments are received on a nonperforming loan, interest income is recognized to the extent it would have been recognized if normal principal and interest would have been received timely. If payments are received to bring a nonperforming loan back to less than days past due, we will resume accruing interest income on that loan. There were loans in non-accrual status at September 30, 2024 and loans in non-accrual status at December 31, 2023. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 we recognized interest income of million and million on loans which were in non-accrual status at the respective period end. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 we recognized interest income on loans which were in non-accrual status at the respective period end. 
 Loan Modifications 
 Our commercial and residential mortgage loans may be subject to loan modifications. Loan modifications may be granted to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty and could include principal forgiveness, interest rate reduction, an other-than-significant delay or a term extension. We consider the following factors in determining whether or not a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty: 
 borrower is in default, 
 borrower has declared bankruptcy, 
 there is growing concern about the borrower's ability to continue as a going concern, 
 borrower has insufficient cash flows to service debt, 
 borrower's inability to obtain funds from other sources, and 
 there is a breach of financial covenants by the borrower. 
 A loan modification typically does not result in a change in valuation allowance as it is already incorporated into our allowance methodology. However, if we grant a borrower experiencing financial difficulty principal forgiveness, the amount of principal forgiven would be written off, which would reduce the amortized cost of the loan and result in an adjustment to the valuation allowance.

billion of reserves associated with a diversified block of term life insurance, whole life insurance, indexed universal life insurance, universal life insurance and universal life insurance with secondary guarantee. Policies written by American National Life Insurance Company, American National Life Insurance Company of Texas and Garden State Life Insurance Company are ceded on a quota share basis, while policies written by American National Life Insurance Company of New York are ceded on an quota share basis. This reinsurance transaction represents approximately half of the Company s in-force life business. As part of this reinsurance transaction, the Company recognized a deferred gain of billion, which is recorded in Other liabilities in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position as of September 30, 2024. This deferred gain represents the unamortized portion of the cost of reinsurance related to the in-force business which will be amortized over the life of the underlying reinsured policies. The deferred gain represents primarily the difference between liabilities ceded and assets transferred as part of the reinsurance agreement. The amortization of the deferred gain recognized in Other income in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was million. 
 There were no other significant changes to third party reinsurance agreements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 We calculate estimated losses on reinsurance recoverable balances by determining an expected loss ratio. The expected loss ratio is based on industry historical loss experience and expected recovery timing adjusted for certain current and forecasted environmental factors management believes to be relevant. Estimated losses related to our reinsurance recoverable balances was million as of September 30, 2024. 
 The company incurred risk charge fees of million and million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, in relation to reinsurance agreements. 
 Intercompany Reinsurance Agreements 
 The Company executes various intercompany reinsurance agreements between its subsidiaries, including off shore entities, for purposes of managing regulatory statutory capital and risk. All intercompany balances have been eliminated in the preparation of the accompanying financial statements. 
 These intercompany transactions are executed with wholly-owned reinsurance subsidiaries, AEL Re Vermont, AEL Re Vermont II, Freestone Re Ltd. Freestone ), and AEL Re Bermuda Ltd. The reinsurance agreements with AEL Re Vermont and AEL Re Vermont II involve reinsuring a portion of lifetime income benefit rider payments in excess of policy fund values. These entities then entered into third-party excess of loss agreements which are permitted to be an admitted asset on the statutory balance sheets. The reinsurance agreement with AEL Re Bermuda Ltd. is a coinsurance agreement to reinsure a portion of fixed index annuities on a funds withheld basis. The reinsurance agreements with Freestone involve reinsuring certain group annuity contracts issued under PRT transactions and certain single premium immediate annuities, fixed deferred annuities, fixed index annuities and multi-year guarantee annuities.

 Accounting for the Merger is not finalized, and there remains some measurement uncertainty on the acquisition valuation, which is pending completion of a comprehensive evaluation of the net assets acquired within the next twelve months, including but not limited to identifiable intangible assets, deferred income tax assets, and policyholders account balances. The financial statements as of September 30, 2024 reflect management s current best estimate of the purchase price allocation. Final valuation of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed and the completion of the purchase price allocation will occur by the second quarter of 2025. As a result, the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired, representing goodwill of million as of September 30, 2024, may be adjusted in future periods. Goodwill recognized is not deductible for income tax purposes. In conjunction with the Merger and Post-Effective Merger, Brookfield Wealth Solutions agreed to indemnify ANGI for certain liabilities that could arise as a result of merger-related activities, including tax liabilities. 
 Following the Merger, on May 7, 2024, American National and AEL completed the Post-Effective Merger and subsequent Reincorporation. The Post-Effective Merger has been accounted for as a common control transaction as if the parent, American National, acquired the shares of its subsidiary, AEL, similar to that of a reverse acquisition without a change in basis for the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. American National is therefore regarded as the predecessor reporting entity from an accounting perspective even though AEL is the surviving legal entity. 
 The business operations of AEL, which are now part of ANGI, contributed revenues of billion and a net loss of million to the Company for the period from May 2, 2024 to September 30, 2024. Had the Merger occurred on January 1, 2023, the consolidated unaudited pro forma revenue and net profit would be (i) billion and billion, respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024; (ii) billion and million income, respectively, for the three months ended September 30, 2023; and (iii) billion and million, respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The pro forma amounts have been calculated using the subsidiary s results and adjusting them for the revised depreciation and amortization that would have been charged assuming the fair value adjustments to investments, property and equipment and intangible assets had applied from January 1, 2023, together with the consequential tax effects. 
 The current best estimate of the purchase price allocation reflects the inclusion of updated mortality, base lapse and lifetime income benefit rider utilization assumptions related to AEL s market risk benefits liability as part of its annual assumptions review which took place in the third quarter of 2024. This resulted in a million increase in both the value of business acquired asset and market risk benefits liability.

The notable changes to cash flow assumptions in the third quarter of 2024 resulted in (i) a decrease in the liability for future policy benefits related to annuity products driven by favorable mortality. The change in mortality resulted in an offsetting increase to the deferred profit liability; (ii) a decrease in the liability for future policy benefits for term life products primarily driven by favorable mortality and favorable updates to policyholder lapse behavior assumptions; and (iii) an increase in the future policy benefits liability for universal life products driven by unfavorable updates in policyholder lapse assumptions and unfavorable mortality.

For the nine-month period, the Company s effective tax rate differed from the statutory tax rate of 21 primarily due to the recognition of a deferred tax benefit related to the Bermuda corporate income tax. 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the effective tax rates on pre-tax income were and respectively.

 Pillar Two and Bermuda Corporate Income Tax Regime 
 The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development OECD and its member countries with support from the G20, have proposed the enactment of a global minimum tax of 15 for Multinational Enterprise MNE groups with global annual revenue of 750 million or more Pillar Two ). The Company may become subject to additional income taxes as a result of these proposals, as enacted locally across jurisdictions. 
 The Company s wholly-owned subsidiary, Freestone, is incorporated under the laws of Bermuda and is not required to pay any taxes in Bermuda based upon income or capital gains. However, in December 2023, the Government of Bermuda enacted a corporate income tax CIT regime, designed to align with the OECD s global minimum tax rules. Effective January 1, 2025, the regime applies a 15 CIT to Bermuda businesses that are part of MNE groups with annual revenue of 750 million or more. As a result of this new regime, the Company recognized a deferred tax benefit of million as of December 31, 2023. 
 The new Bermuda CIT introduced an economic transition adjustment ETA which allows for an elective increase or decrease in the tax basis of assets and liabilities (excluding goodwill) held as of September 30, 2023 to fair value. It also allows for the recognition of a DTA related to the value of identifiable intangible assets that may be amortized over 10 years, beginning January 1, 2025. Examples of identifiable intangible assets include brand and trade names, software, customer relationships and the value of in-force insurance business. On January 16, 2024, the Government of Bermuda clarified that the ETA can be applied to customer or supplier relationships between separate legal entities, whether intragroup or with third parties . With the release of this additional guidance by the Government of Bermuda as well as the increase of forecasted taxable income in Bermuda, we recognized additional deferred tax assets of million (through deferred tax expense) and million (via acquisition accounting for AEL) which increased our Bermuda CIT related deferred tax asset to million. The Company will continue to monitor developments prior to the commencement of this regime.

As a result of and following the Merger and the Reincorporation, the Company had shares of common stock with a par value of per share authorized, of which all are issued and outstanding. See Note 1 - Organization and Description of the Company for additional information. 
 On November 21, 2019, AEL issued shares of Fixed-Rate Reset Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series A ("Series A") with a par value per share and a liquidation preference of per share, for aggregate net proceeds of million. 
 On June 10, 2020, AEL issued shares of Fixed-Rate Reset Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series B ("Series B") with a par value per share and a liquidation preference of per share, for aggregate net proceeds of million.

Statutory net income (loss) for the periods ended September 30, 2024 presented above represent earnings reported to its regulator and are inclusive of earnings prior to the Company s acquisition of AEL. 
 Prescribed and Permitted Statutory Accounting Practices 
 American Equity Investment Life Insurance Company (AEILIC) is domiciled in the State of Iowa and is regulated by the Iowa Insurance Division. AEILIC uses prescribed statutory accounting practice which allows for call option derivatives instruments hedging the interest credited on fixed indexed annuities to be recorded at amortized cost and the related fixed index annuity reserve to account for the next index crediting term to be valued at zero. The use of the prescribed statutory accounting practice resulted in lower statutory capital and surplus of million as of September 30, 2024. 
 AEILIC cedes certain lifetime income benefit rider payments in excess of the policyholder s account balances to two subsidiaries in Vermont, AEL Re Vermont and AEL Re Vermont II. The Vermont subsidiaries have been granted permitted practices from the Vermont Department to recognize as an admitted asset an excess of loss reinsurance agreement with a third party which reinsures the lifetime income benefit rider payments in excess of policyholder funds values upon exhaustion of a funds withheld account balance. The permitted practice increased the statutory capital of AEL by billion at September 30, 2024. Without such permitted practices, the risk based capital at the Vermont entities would fall below the minimum regulatory requirements.

The statutory capital and surplus of both ANPAC and American National Lloyds Insurance Company would have remained above the authorized control level RBC had it not used the permitted practice. 
 Statutory Dividend Restrictions 
 The ability of the Company s insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends, or other distributions, to their parent companies (and ultimately the Company) is subject to certain restrictions imposed by the jurisdictions of domicile that regulate these insurance subsidiaries, and each jurisdiction typically has calculations for the amount of dividends that an insurance company can pay without the prior approval of the insurance regulatory authorities. 
 The following provides a summary of statutory restrictions on the payment of dividends for the Company s insurance subsidiaries in various jurisdictions: 
 U.S. insurance entities Various state insurance laws restrict the amount that may be transferred to the parent company by its insurance subsidiaries in the form of dividends without prior approval of the insurance regulatory authorities. These restrictions are based, in part, on the prior year s statutory income and surplus. In general, dividends up to specified levels are considered ordinary and may be paid without prior regulatory approval. Dividends in larger amounts, or extraordinary dividends, are subject to the approval by the insurance commissioner of the applicable state of domicile. 
 The following are dividend restrictions applicable to American Equity s U.S. insurance subsidiaries:

Certain lawsuits include claims for compensatory and punitive damages. We provide accruals for these items to the extent we deem the losses probable and reasonably estimable. After reviewing these matters with legal counsel, based upon information presently available, management is of the opinion that the ultimate resultant liability, if any, would not have a material adverse effect on the statements of financial position, liquidity or results of operations; however, assessing the eventual outcome of litigation necessarily involves forward-looking speculation as to judgments to be made by judges, juries and appellate courts in the future.

 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we reported total net premiums of 888 million, compared to net premiums of 784 million for the same period in 2023. The increase of 104 million is primarily due to continued growth in the PRT business. 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 vs. 2023 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we reported total net premiums of 3.0 billion, compared to net premiums of 2.6 billion for the same period in 2023. The increase of 470 million is primarily due to growth within the annuities segment as we continue to scale our PRT business.

 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we reported total gross annuity sales of 4.1 billion, compared to gross annuity sales of 1.6 billion for the same period in 2023. The increase of 2.5 billion is primarily due to the addition of fixed index annuity deposits generated by American Equity subsequent to the completion of the acquisition as well as strong fixed rate annuity and PRT sales. 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 vs. 2023 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we reported total gross annuity sales of 9.0 billion, compared to gross annuity sales of 4.9 billion in the prior year period.

The following table summarizes the financial results of our business for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:

 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 vs. 2023 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we reported net loss of (288) million, compared to net income of 54 million for the same period in 2023. The decrease of (342) million was primarily due to an increase in the change in fair value of insurance-related derivatives and embedded derivatives and an increase in the change in fair value of market risk benefits as a result of equity market and interest rate movements. Additionally, there was an increase in policyholder benefits and claims incurred due to growth in the PRT business and an increase in interest sensitive contract benefits and operating expenses which were primarily driven by the inclusion of American Equity following the acquisition. Those impacts were partially offset by an increase in net investment income and other policy revenue primarily due to the inclusion of American Equity following the acquisition. 
 Net premiums and other policy revenue were 1.1 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 890 million for the same period in 2023. The increase of 206 million was primarily due to an increase in other policy revenue which reflects surrender fee and rider fee income recognized on annuity policies added following the acquisition of American Equity as well as strong sales in the PRT business. 
 Net investment income increased by 649 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023. Net investment income comprise interest and dividends received on financial instruments, equity investments and other miscellaneous fee income. The increase in 2024 was driven by the increase in assets under management following the acquisition of American Equity as well as the continued growth in the existing investment portfolio and the rotation into higher yielding investment strategies. 
 We recorded (128) million of investment related losses for the three months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 116 million compared to the same period in 2023. The increase was primarily due to an increase in realized losses on investments driven by the transfer of assets pursuant to RGA reinsurance transaction which was effective July 1, 2024. 
 Policyholder benefits and claims incurred were 846 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 717 million for the same period in 2023. The increase of 129 million was primarily due to an increase in growth of the PRT business which resulted in higher reserves. This was partially offset by a decreased claims incurred due to the impact of business ceded to RGA subsequent to the effectuation of the reinsurance transaction.

Interest sensitive contract benefits represent interest credited to policyholders account balances from our investment contracts with customers. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, interest sensitive contract benefits increased by 390 million compared to the same period in 2023, driven mainly by an increase in the in-force block of annuity business following the acquisition of American Equity. 
 Amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs, deferred sales inducements and value of business acquired increased by 153 million compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to an increase in the amortization of VOBA due to the increase in the VOBA asset following the acquisition of American Equity as well as the continued growth of the annuity business which increases the deferred acquisition cost asset. 
 Change in fair value of insurance-related derivatives and embedded derivatives increased by 290 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period of 2023. The increase was primarily due to the impact of interest rates and equity market performance on the fair value of the embedded derivatives and equity-indexed options and an update to the short term option budget assumption used in the calculation of the fair value of the embedded derivatives associated with fixed index annuity products. 
 Change in fair value of market risk benefits represents the mark-to-market movements of our liability based on protection to the policyholder from capital market risk. The increase in the fair value of market risk benefits of 148 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period of 2023 was primarily due to the impact of interest rates and equity markets on the valuation of these liabilities as well as the net impact of updates to the option budget assumption and policyholder lapse assumption used in the calculation of the fair value of market risk benefits. Additionally, the market risk benefit liabilities increased as a result of the acquisition of American Equity leading to increases in the change in the fair value of these liabilities. 
 Operating expenses were 228 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 147 million for the same period in 2023, an increase of 81 million. The increase was primarily driven by the inclusion of operating expenses from American Equity subsequent to the acquisition. 
 The increase of 22 million of interest expense on borrowings compared to the same period in 2023 was mainly due to increased borrowings with the new term loan entered into in May 2024 as well as the acquisition of American Equity which included legacy senior notes and subordinated debt. 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 vs. 2023 
 The results of operations discussed below comprise results for American National for all periods presented and results for American Equity for the period May 2, 2024 to September 30, 2024. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we reported net income of 80 million, compared to a net income of 163 million for the same period in 2023. The decrease is primarily due to an increase in the change in fair value of insurance-related derivatives and embedded derivatives and an increase in the change in fair value of market risk benefits as a result of equity market and interest rate movements. Additionally, there was an increase in policyholder benefits and claims incurred due to growth in the PRT business and an increase in interest sensitive contract benefits and operating expenses due to the inclusion of American Equity following the acquisition. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in net investment income and other policy revenue due to the inclusion of American Equity. 
 Net premiums and other policy revenue of 3.5 billion increased by 668 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023 primarily due to growth in the PRT business partially offset by an increase in ceded premiums with the cession of the specialty market group block of business beginning in Q1 2024. Additionally, there was an increase in other policy revenue which reflects surrender fee and rider fee income recognized on annuity policies added following the acquisition of American Equity. 
 Net investment income increased by 1.4 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023. The increase was primarily driven by the increase in assets under management following the acquisition of American Equity as well as the continued growth in the existing investment portfolio and the rotation into higher yielding investment strategies. 
 The Company incurred investment related losses of 160 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 32 million for the same period in 2023. The increase in investment losses of 128 million was primarily due to realized losses on investments driven by the transfer of assets pursuant to the RGA reinsurance transaction which was effective July 1, 2024. 
 Policyholder benefits and claims incurred increased by 556 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023. The increase is primarily due to an increase in growth of the PRT business which resulted in higher reserves. Additionally, there was an increase in catastrophe claims on the property and casualty business due to weather related incidents. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in claims incurred due to the impact of business ceded to RGA beginning in Q2 2024. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, interest sensitive contract benefits increased compared to the same period in 2023 by 730 million which was primarily driven by an increase in the in-force block of annuity business following the acquisition of American Equity. 
 Amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs, deferred sales inducements and value of business acquired increased by 250 million compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to an increase in the amortization of VOBA due to the increase in the VOBA asset following the acquisition of American Equity as well as the continued growth of the annuity business which increases the deferred acquisition cost asset. 
 68 

Change in fair value of insurance-related derivatives and embedded derivatives increased by 292 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period of 2023. The increase was primarily due to the impact of interest rates and equity market performance on the fair value of the embedded derivatives and equity-indexed options and an update to the short term option budget assumption used in the calculation of the fair value of the embedded derivatives associated with fixed index annuity products. 
 The increase in the change in fair value of market risk benefit of 313 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period of 2023 was primarily due to the impact of interest rates and equity markets on the valuation of these liabilities as well as the net impact of updates to the option budget assumption and policyholder lapse assumption used in the calculation of the fair value of market risk benefits. Additionally, the market risk benefit liabilities increased as a result of the acquisition of American Equity leading to increases in the change in the fair value of these liabilities. 
 Operating expenses increased by 216 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023, primarily driven by transaction expenses incurred related to the acquisition of American Equity as well as an increase associated with five months of operating expenses from American Equity subsequent to the acquisition. 
 Interest expense on borrowings increased by 41 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 primarily as a result of increased borrowings with the new term loan entered into in May 2024 as well as the acquisition of American Equity which included legacy senior notes and subordinated debt. 
 Distributable Operating Earnings 
 We measure operating performance primarily using Distributable Operating Earnings DOE which measures our ability to acquire net insurance assets at a positive margin, and invest these assets at a return that is greater than the cost of policyholder liabilities. 
 The following table presents DOE of each of our reporting segments for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 (Dollars in millions) Annuity 
 342 95 691 305 Life 
 42 64 162 147 Property and Casualty 23 (8) 51 2 Corporate and Other (47) (11) (92) (7) 360 140 812 447 
 Comparison of Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 vs. 2023 
 Annuity DOE within our annuity business represents contribution from both our retail and institutional platforms. DOE increased by 247 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. The increase is primarily attributable to earnings contributed from AEL as well as increased investment income from our continued deployment into higher yielding investment strategies. 
 Life DOE decreased by (22) million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. The decrease is primarily driven by the impact of the RGA reinsurance treaty executed during the quarter. 
 Property and Casualty DOE increased by 31 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. The increase was driven by improvements in our loss experience arising from underwriting actions implemented over the past twelve months. 
 Corporate and Other DOE decreased by (36) million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. The decrease was primarily driven by increased interest expenses due to debt assumed and raised through the acquisition of AEL. 
 Comparison of Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 vs. 2023 
 Annuity DOE increased by 386 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. The increase is primarily attributable to earnings contributed from AEL, the scale-up of our U.S. PRT business as well as increased investment income from our continued deployment into higher yielding investment strategies. 
 Life DOE increased by 15 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. The increase was driven by improved investment income from our continued deployment into higher yielding investment strategies, partially offset by the impact of the RGA reinsurance treaty executed during the third quarter. 
 Property and Casualty DOE increased by 49 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. The increase was driven by improvements in loss experience arising from underwriting actions implemented since the prior year period. 
 69 

Corporate and Other DOE decreased by (85) million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. The decrease was primarily driven by increases in interest expenses due to debt assumed and raised through the acquisition of AEL. 
 
 Financial Condition 
 Comparison as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 
 The following table summarizes the financial position as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023: 
 September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 (Dollars in millions) Assets Investments 76,024 28,243 Cash and cash equivalents 13,873 3,192 Accrued investment income 688 196 Deferred policy acquisition costs, deferred sales inducements and value of business acquired 8,376 944 Premiums due and other receivables 503 484 Ceded unearned premiums 165 45 Deferred tax asset 288 291 Reinsurance recoverables and deposit assets 18,015 427 Property and equipment 187 168 Intangible assets 1,599 44 Other assets 1,885 541 Goodwill 754 121 Separate account assets 1,302 1,189 Total assets 123,659 35,885 Liabilities Future policy benefits 7,179 6,108 Policyholders account balances 82,413 17,177 Policy and contract claims 1,903 1,870 Market risk benefits 3,725 34 Unearned premium reserve 1,164 1,139 Due to related parties 43 Other policyholder funds 348 335 Notes payable 179 174 Long term borrowings 2,959 1,493 Funds withheld for reinsurance liabilities 8,812 Other liabilities 3,650 467 Separate account liabilities 1,302 1,189 Total liabilities 113,677 29,986 Equity Preferred stock, Series A and Series B 685 Additional paid-in capital 6,942 5,185 Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of taxes 1,481 (109) Retained earnings 709 716 Non-controlling interests 165 107 Total equity 9,982 5,899 Total liabilities and equity 123,659 35,885 September 30, 2024 vs. December 31, 2023 
 Total assets increased by 87.8 billion during the year to 123.7 billion. The increase primarily related to the acquisition of 81.2 billion of assets from American Equity as well as additional deployment of cash associated with annuity and PRT sales during the year. 
 Total investments increased by 47.8 billion from December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024. The increase primarily relates to the acquisition of 43.0 billion of investments from American Equity as well as the deployment of excess cash and cash from new sales into investments during the year. 
 70 

Cash and cash equivalents increased by 10.7 billion from December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024. The increase primarily relates to the acquisition of 13.4 billion of cash and cash equivalents from American Equity partially offset by the impact of deploying excess cash into investments subsequent to the acquisition. 
 Deferred policy acquisition costs DAC ), deferred sales inducements DSI and value of business acquired VOBA are capitalized costs directly related to writing new policyholder contracts and include the VOBA intangible assets. During the year, the balance increased by 7.4 billion primarily driven by the addition of 7.2 billion of VOBA related to the acquisition of American Equity. Additionally, deferrals associated with writing new business contributed to an increase of 1.1 billion of DAC and DSI assets, partially offset by 650 million of amortization of DAC, DSI and VOBA recorded during the year. 
 Deferred tax assets decreased by 3 million from December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024. The decrease is due to changes in estimates for deferred tax assets associated with our Bermuda subsidiaries, including economic transition adjustments, which allow for elective fair value adjustments to the tax basis of assets and liabilities and increased unrealized gains on investment securities, partially offset by the addition of a deferred tax liability from the acquisition of American Equity. 
 Reinsurance recoverables and deposit assets are estimated amounts due to the Company from reinsurers and include reinsurance receivables and recoverables from reinsurers and deposit assets associated with reinsurance agreements. The amount increased by 17.6 billion in the year primarily due to the acquisition of American Equity, which contributed 15.0 billion of reinsurance recoverables and deposit assets, and the RGA reinsurance transaction executed in Q3 2024, which contributed approximately 3.0 billion of reinsurance recoverables. These increases were slightly offset by a decrease in reinsurance recoverable due to an increase in benefits and surrenders ceded for existing American Equity reinsurance agreements. 
 Intangible assets increased by 1.6 billion during the year, primarily due to the acquisition of American Equity which resulted in 1.6 billion of additional intangible assets primarily associated with the distributor relationships, trade name, and insurance licenses. 
 Other assets increased by 1.3 billion during the year to 1.9 billion. The balance includes current tax asset, market risk benefit asset, prepaid pension assets, as well as other miscellaneous receivables, and includes an increase of 670 million as a result of the acquisition of American Equity. 
 Goodwill increased 633 million during 2024 as a result of the acquisition of American Equity. 
 Separate account assets and liabilities both increased by 113 million during 2024, primarily due to net realized gains of underlying assets of 156 million and policyholder deposits of 55 million, partially offset by 103 million of policyholder benefits and withdrawals. 
 Future policy benefits and policyholders account balances increased by 66.3 billion during 2024 primarily due to the acquisition of American Equity which contributed to an increase in 61.8 billion. Additionally, there was an increase associated with the net impact of new premiums and interest credited to policyholders net of surrenders and withdrawals. 
 Market risk benefits increased by 3.7 billion during 2024 primarily due to the acquisition of American Equity which contributed to an increase of 3.0 billion. Additionally, the market risk benefits increased subsequent to the acquisition due to the impact of changes in interest rates and equity markets and as a result of the net impact of updates to the option budget assumption and policyholder lapse assumption used in the calculation of the fair value of market risk benefits. 
 Notes payable and long term borrowings increased by 1.5 billion during 2024 primarily due to the execution of a new term loan agreement in May of 2024 which resulted in 1.9 billion of additional borrowings. This increase is partially offset by the payoff of a historical term loan with the proceeds of the new term loan issued upon acquisition. 
 Funds withheld for reinsurance liabilities increased by 8.8 billion during 2024 due to the acquisition of American Equity which held this liability as a result of certain coinsurance funds withheld and modified coinsurance reinsurance agreements which were in place prior to the acquisition. 
 Other liabilities increased by 3.2 billion during 2024. The balance includes the reinsured market risk benefits liability, accrued interest on debt and other miscellaneous payables. The increase during 2024 is primarily due to the acquisition of American Equity which contributed an increase of 2.1 billion and the 1.5 billion deferred gain associated with the RGA reinsurance transaction executed in Q3 2024.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Capital Resources 
 We strive to maintain sufficient financial liquidity at all times so that we are able to participate in attractive opportunities as they arise, better withstand sudden adverse changes in economic circumstances within our operating subsidiaries and maintain payments to policyholders. Our principal sources of liquidity are cash flows from our operations and access to the Company s third-party credit facilities. We proactively manage our liquidity position to meet liquidity needs and continue to develop relationships with lenders who provide borrowing capacity at competitive rates, while looking to minimize adverse impacts on investment returns. We look to structure the ownership of our assets to enhance our ability to monetize them to provide additional liquidity, if needed. Our liquidity for the periods noted below consisted of the following: 
 September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 (Dollars in millions) Cash and cash equivalents 13,873 3,192 Liquid financial assets 26,897 10,373 Undrawn credit facilities 1,577 646 Total liquidity (1) 42,347 14,211 
 (1) Liquidity is a measure of our liquidity position and includes cash and cash equivalents, undrawn revolving credit facilities and liquid financial assets in both our corporate entities and regulated insurance entities. 
 Today, we have significant liquidity within our insurance portfolios, giving us flexibility to secure attractive investment opportunities. In addition to a portfolio of highly liquid financial assets, our operating companies have additional access to liquidity from sources such as the Federal Home Loan Bank FHLB ). As of September 30, 2024, the Company had no drawings and a total of 1.6 billion undrawn commitment available related to this program. 
 Liquidity within our insurance subsidiaries may be restricted from time to time due to regulatory constraints. As of September 30, 2024, the Company s total liquidity was 42.3 billion, which included 42 million of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents. 
 Comparison of the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 The following table presents a summary of our cash flows and ending cash balances for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 (Dollars in millions) Operating activities 2,104 676 Investing activities 6,565 (1,713) Financing activities 2,012 1,912 Cash and cash equivalents: Cash and cash equivalents, beginning of year 3,192 1,389 Net change during the year 10,681 875 Cash and cash equivalents, end of period 13,873 2,264 
 Operating Activities 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we generated 2.1 billion of cash from operating activities compared to 676 million during 2023, primarily due to higher investment income from the growth in the investment portfolio, coupled with the addition of American Equity s investments. 
 Investing Activities 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we continued to rotate our investment portfolio into higher yielding investment strategies and acquired 10.8 billion of cash and cash equivalents from the acquisition of American Equity, net of cash proceeds paid. This resulted in net inflow of 6.6 billion of cash from investing activities, compared to net deployment of 1.7 billion in the prior year. 
 Financing Activities 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded a net cash inflow of 2.0 billion from our financing activities, compared to 1.9 billion recorded in 2023. The proceeds in the current year period were mainly as a result of 1.7 billion net payments received on policyholders account deposits, as well as debt raised through the acquisition of American Equity. 
 72 

Financial Instruments 
 To the extent that we believe it is economically prudent to do so, our strategy is to hedge a portion of our equity investments and/or cash flows exposed to foreign currencies by the Company. The following key principles form the basis of our foreign currency hedging strategy: 
 We leverage any natural hedges that may exist within our operations; 
 We utilize local currency debt financing to the extent possible; and 
 We may utilize derivative contracts to the extent that natural hedges are insufficient. 
 Future Capital Obligations and Requirements 
 As of September 30, 2024, subsidiaries of the Company had outstanding investment commitments of 3.3 billion. The funded commitments are primarily recognized as mortgage loans, private loans, investment funds, real estate and other invested assets. For additional information, see Note 28 - Financial Commitments and Contingencies of the financial statements. 
 The following is the maturity by year on long term borrowings: 
 Payments Due by Year Total Unamortized Discount and Issuance Costs Less Than 1 year 1-2 Years 2-3 Years 3-4 Years 4-5 Years More Than 5 Years (Dollars in millions) As of September 30, 2024 
 Long term borrowings 2,959 (41) 2,400 600 As of December 31, 2023 
 Long term borrowings 1,493 (7) 1,000 500 
 For additional information, See Note 21 - Notes Payable and Long Term Borrowings of the financial statements. 
 Capital Management 
 Capital management is the on-going process of determining and maintaining the quantity and quality of capital appropriate to take advantage of the Company s growth opportunities, to support the risks associated with the business and to optimize shareholder returns while fully complying with the regulatory capital requirements. 
 The Company and its subsidiaries take an integrated approach to risk management that involves the Company s risk appetite and capital requirements. The enterprise risk management framework includes a capital management policy that describes the key processes related to capital management, which is reviewed at least annually and approved by the Board of Directors. The operating capital levels are determined by the Company s risk appetite and Own Risk and Solvency Assessment ORSA ). Furthermore, additional stress techniques are used to evaluate the Company s capital adequacy under sustained adverse scenarios. 
 The Company has determined that it is in compliance with all capital requirements as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
 
 Performance Measures Used by Management 
 To measure performance, we focus on net income and total assets, as well as certain non-GAAP measures, including DOE and Total Liquidity, which we believe are useful to investors to provide additional insights into assets within the business available for redeployment. Refer to the Results of Operations , Financial Condition, and Liquidity and Capital Resources sections of this MD A for further discussion on our performance and Non-GAAP measures for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 Non-GAAP Measures 
 We regularly monitor certain Non-GAAP measures that are used to evaluate our performance and analyze underlying business performance and trends. We use these measures to establish budgets and operational goals, manage our business and evaluate our performance. We also believe that these measures help investors compare our operating performance with our results in prior years. These Non-GAAP financial measures are provided as supplemental information to the financial measures presented in this MD A that are calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. These Non-GAAP measures are not comparable to GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly described Non-GAAP measures reported by other companies, including those within our industry. 
 Consequently, our Non-GAAP measures should not be evaluated in isolation, but rather, should be considered together with the most directly comparable GAAP measure in our consolidated financial statements for the years presented. The Non-GAAP financial measures we present in this MD A should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures determined or calculated in accordance with GAAP. 
 73 

Distributable Operating Earnings 
 We use DOE to assess operating results and the performance of our businesses. We define DOE as net income after applicable taxes, excluding the impact of depreciation and amortization, deferred income taxes related to basis and other changes, and breakage and transaction costs, as well as certain investment and insurance reserve gains and losses, including gains and losses related to asset and liability matching strategies, non-operating adjustments related to changes in cash flow assumptions for future policy benefits and change in market risk benefits. DOE is inclusive of returns on equity invested in certain variable interest entities and our share of adjusted earnings from our investments in certain associates. 
 DOE is a measure of operating performance that is not calculated in accordance with, and does not have any standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP. DOE is, therefore, unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers. 
 We believe our presentation of DOE is useful to investors because it supplements investors understanding of our operating performance by providing information regarding our ongoing performance that excludes items we believe do not directly affect our core operations. Our presentation of DOE also provides investors enhanced comparability of our ongoing performance across years. 
 Total Liquidity 
 Total Liquidity is a measure of our liquidity position and includes cash and cash equivalents, undrawn revolving credit facilities and liquid financial assets held by our regulated insurance entities. 
 The following table contains further details regarding our use of our Non-GAAP measures, as well as a reconciliation of net income to DOE: 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2024 2023 2024 2023 (Dollars in millions) Net income (loss) 
 (299) 54 58 163 Net investment gains and losses, including reinsurance funds withheld (1)

 32 5 163 7 Depreciation 
 25 5 49 15 DOE 360 140 812 447 
 (1) Net investment gains and losses, including reinsurance funds withheld represents mark-to-market gains (losses) on our invested assets and reinsurance funds withheld. Mark-to-market gains (losses) on our invested assets are presented as Investment related gains (losses) on the statements of operations. See Note 10, Net Investment Income and Investment Related Gains (Losses) of the financial statements for additional details. Mark-to-market gains (losses) on reinsurance funds withheld are included in Net investment results from reinsurance funds withheld and represent the change in fair value of the embedded derivative during the period. See Note 9, Derivative Instruments of the financial statements for additional details. 
 (2) Mark-to-market on insurance contracts and other net assets principally represents the mark-to-market effect on insurance-related liabilities, net of reinsurance, due to changes in market risks (e.g., interest rates, equity markets and equity index volatility) and includes depreciation expenses on investment real estate. These mark-to-market effects are primarily included in Net investment income , Interest sensitive contract benefits , Change in fair value of insurance-related derivatives and embedded derivatives and Change in fair value of market risk benefits on the statements of operations. See the following notes to the financial statements for additional information: (i) Note 9, Derivative Instruments (ii) Note 10, Net Investment Income and Investment Related Gains(Losses) (iii) Note 18, Policyholders Account Balances and (iv) Note 19, Market Risk Benefits . 
 (3) Included in Mark-to-market on insurance contracts and other net assets are returns on equity invested in certain variable interest entities and our share of adjusted earnings from our investments in certain associates as stated in the definition of DOE. Returns on equity invested in certain variable interest entities primarily represent equity-accounted income from our investments in real estate partnerships and investment funds and are included in Net investment income on the statements of operations. Additionally, our share of adjusted earnings from our investments in certain associates represent our share of DOE from AEL following the announcement of our acquisition in the third quarter of 2023. 
 
 New Accounting Pronouncements 
 See Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our unaudited consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-Q, which is incorporated by reference in this Item 2.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 Market Risk 
 Our statements of financial position within our financial statements include substantial amounts of assets and liabilities whose fair values are subject to market risks. Our significant market risks are primarily associated with interest rates and credit risk. The fair values of our investment portfolios remain subject to considerable volatility. The following sections address the significant market risks associated with our business activities. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 Substantial and sustained increases or decreases in interest rates may cause certain market dislocations that could negatively impact our financial performance. 
 We manage interest rate risk through our asset liability management, which we refer to as ALM, the framework whereby the effective and key rate durations of the investment portfolio are closely matched to those of the insurance reserves. Within the context of the ALM framework, we use derivatives including interest rate swaps and futures to reduce market risk. For the annuity business, where the timing and amount of the benefit payment obligations can be readily determined, the matching of asset and liability cash flows is effectively controlled through this comprehensive duration management process. 
 Other Price Risk 
 Other price risk is the risk of variability in fair value due to movements in equity prices or other market prices such as commodity prices and credit spreads. 
 The Company s exposure to the equity markets is managed by sector and individual security and is intended to track the S P 500 with minor variations. The Company mitigates the equity risk by diversification of the investment portfolio. 
 The Company also has equity risk associated with the equity-indexed life and annuity products the Company issues and assumes. The Company has entered into derivative transactions, primarily over-the-counter equity call options, to hedge the exposure to equity-index changes. 
 Credit Risk 
 Credit risk is the risk of loss from amounts owed by counterparties and arises any time funds are extended, committed, owed or invested through actual or implied contractual arrangements including reinsurance. The Company is primarily exposed to credit risk through its investments in debt securities. 
 We manage exposure to credit risk by establishing concentration limits by counterparty, credit rating and asset class. To further minimize credit risk, the financial condition of the counterparties is monitored on a regular basis. These requirements are outlined in our investment policy. 
 Insurance Risk 
 The Company makes assumptions and estimates when assessing insurance and reinsurance risks, and significant deviations, particularly with regards to longevity and policyholder behavior, could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and cash flows. All transaction terms are likely to be determined by qualitative and quantitative factors, including our estimates. If we reinsure a block of business, there can be no assurance that the transaction will achieve the results expected at the time of the block s acquisition. These transactions expose us to the risk that actual results materially differ from those estimates. 
 We manage insurance risk through choosing whether to purchase reinsurance for certain amounts of risk underwritten in our Annuity, Life, and Property and Casualty segments. 
 Legal Risk 
 In the future, we may be parties in actions that routinely arise out of the normal course of business, including legal actions seeking to establish liability directly through insurance contracts or indirectly through reinsurance contracts issued by our subsidiaries. Plaintiffs occasionally seek punitive or exemplary damages. We do not believe that such normal and routine litigation will have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations. We are also involved from time to time in other kinds of legal actions, some of which assert or may assert claims or seek to impose fines and penalties. We believe that any liability that may arise as a result of other pending legal actions will not have a material effect on our financial statements.

Operational Risk 
 Operational risk is the potential for loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems, or from external events. The Company s internal control processes are supported by the maintenance of a risk register and independent internal audit review. The risk of fraud is managed through a number of processes including background checks on staff on hire, annual code of conduct confirmations, anti-bribery training and segregation of duties. 
 We have significant outsourcing arrangements in respect of pension administration and other functions. These arrangements are subject to agreements with formal service levels, operate within agreed authority limits and are subject to regular review by senior management. Material outsourcing arrangements are approved and monitored by the Board of Directors. 
 Disaster recovery and business continuity plans have also been established to manage the Company s ability to operate under adverse conditions. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 In accordance with Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e), our management, under the supervision of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report on Form 10-Q. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024 in recording, processing, summarizing and reporting, on a timely basis, information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act. 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. As a result of the Post-Effective Merger, the Company s overall control environment and its internal control over financial reporting now incorporate the internal controls over financial reporting that continue in place for American National as well as AEL.
