EXPLANATORY NOTE 

On May 13, 2024, Proficient
Auto Logistics, Inc. Proficient completed the initial public offering (the IPO of its common stock. Prior
to the IPO, Proficient had entered into agreements (the Combination Agreements to acquire in multiple, separate acquisitions
(the Combinations five operating businesses and their respective affiliated entities, as applicable, operating under the
following names: (i) Delta Automotive Services, Inc. (which converted to Delta Automotive Services, LLC in an F-reorganization on
April 29, 2024), doing business as Delta Auto Transport, Inc. Delta ), (ii) Deluxe Auto Carriers, Inc. Deluxe ),
(iii) Sierra Mountain Group, Inc. Sierra ), (iv) Proficient Auto Transport, Inc. Proficient Transport ),
and (v) Tribeca Automotive Inc. Tribeca and, together with Delta, Deluxe, Sierra, and Proficient Transport, the Founding
Companies ). On May 13, 2024, in connection with the closing of the IPO, Proficient also completed the acquisitions of all the
Founding Companies. 

For accounting and reporting purposes, Proficient has been identified
as the designated accounting acquirer Successor of each of the Founding Companies and Proficient Transport has been identified
as the designated accounting predecessor Predecessor to the Company (as defined below). The Successor financial information
presented herein includes results of operations from the period May 13, 2024 to September 30, 2024 from the acquired businesses as well
as expenses from the acquiring entity for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. As a result, the unaudited condensed
consolidated financial statements as of, and for the three and nine months ended, September 30, 2024 for Proficient (Successor) and for
the period from January 1, 2024 to May 12, 2024 and the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 for Proficient Transport (Predecessor)
are included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The Company is not required to provide, and this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q does
not contain, pro forma financial data giving effect to the completion of the Combinations and the completion of the IPO and the use of
the proceeds therefrom. However, the Company is providing summary unaudited combined financial information for the three months ended
September 30, 2024. See Management s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition Summary
Unaudited Combined Financial Information. The summary of unaudited combined financial information has been prepared by, and are
the responsibility of, Proficient s and the Founding Companies management. The unaudited consolidated financial statements
have not been audited by the Company's independent registered public accounting firm, except that the consolidated balance sheet as of
December 31, 2023 is derived from Proficient Transport's audited consolidated financial statements. In the opinion of management, the
unaudited consolidated financial statements reflect all necessary adjustments to present fairly the Company's interim financial position,
results of operations and cash flows. All adjustments are of a recurring nature unless otherwise disclosed herein. 

Because Proficient was formed on June 13, 2023 and had no material
transactions in the period from formation through September 30, 2023, no comparative information for the three and nine month periods
ended September 30, 2023 is provided in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 

Unless the context requires
otherwise, references in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q to Proficient refers solely to Proficient Auto Logistics, Inc.
prior to the Combinations, and references to the Company, we, us, and our refer
to Proficient Auto Logistics, Inc. and its subsidiaries after giving effect to the Combinations.

Business Overview 

We are a leading specialized freight company focused on providing auto
transportation and logistics services. Formed in connection with the IPO through the combination of five industry-leading operating
companies, we operate one of the largest auto transportation fleets in North America based upon information obtained from leadership of
the Auto Haulers Association of America, utilizing roughly 1,050 auto transport vehicles and trailers on a daily basis, including approximately
858 Company-owned transport vehicles and trailers, and employing 710 dedicated employees as of October 31, 2024. Prior to the completion
of the IPO, we had not operated as a combined company. From our 49 strategically located facilities across the United States, we
offer a broad range of auto transportation and logistics services, primarily focused on transporting finished vehicles from automotive
production facilities, marine ports of entry or regional rail yards to auto dealerships around the country. We have developed a differentiated
business model due to our scale, breadth of geographic coverage and embedded customer relationships with leading auto original equipment
manufacturing companies OEMs ). Our customers range from large, global auto companies, such as General Motors, BMW, Stellantis,
and Mercedes Benz, to electric vehicle EV producers, such as Tesla and Rivian. Additional customers include auto dealers,
auto auctions, rental car companies and auto leasing companies.

Financial Statement Components 

Revenue 

We generate revenue by transporting
autos for our customers in our OEM contract arrangements and our contract services arrangements. Our OEM contract arrangements provide
auto transportation and logistics services through movements of autos over routes across the United States. Our contract services
offering devotes the use of equipment to specific customers and provides services through long-term contracts. Our business provides
services that are geographically diversified but have similar economic and other relevant characteristics, as they all provide transportation
and logistics of automobiles. 

We are typically paid a
predetermined rate per mile for our Company Drivers services. Consistent with industry practice, our typical customer contracts do
not guarantee load levels or tractor availability. This gives us and our customers a certain degree of flexibility to negotiate
rates up or down in response to changes in auto demand and truck capacity. 

Generally, we receive fuel
surcharges on the miles for which we are compensated by customers. Fuel surcharges revenue mitigates the effect of price increases over
a negotiated base rate per gallon of fuel; however, these revenues may not fully protect us from all fuel price increases. 

We monitor as key operating metrics average revenue per unit and average
revenue per hour, as applicable to the portions of our business that contract on each of these bases. 

Operating Expenses 

Our most significant operating expenses vary with miles traveled and
include (i) fuel and fuel taxes, (ii) driver related expenses, such as salaries, wages, benefits, training and recruitment,
(iii) the cost of purchased transportation that we pay to third-party carriers and (iv) maintenance of our fleet. Expenses
that have both fixed and variable components include maintenance and tire expense and our total cost of insurance and claims. These expenses
generally vary with the miles we travel, but also have a controllable component based on safety, fleet age, efficiency and other factors.
Our main fixed costs include depreciation of long-term assets, such as revenue equipment and service center facilities, the compensation
of non-driver personnel and other general and administrative expenses. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 

In the ordinary course of
business, we have made a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of results of operations and financial position
in the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with GAAP. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates
under different conditions. We believe that the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies, which are those
that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require management s most subjective
and complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. See
Note 2 of the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements of the Company for additional information about our critical
accounting policies and estimates. 

Claims and insurance accruals 

Claims and insurance accruals consist of cargo loss, physical damage,
group health, liability (personal injury and property damage) and workers compensation claims and associated legal and other expenses
within the Company s established retention levels. Claims in excess of retention levels are generally covered by insurance in amounts
the Company considers adequate. Claims accruals represent the uninsured portion of the loss and if we are the primary obligor, the insured
portion of pending claims, plus an estimated liability for incurred but not reported claims and the associated expense. Accruals for cargo
loss, physical damage, group health, liability and workers compensation claims are estimated based on the Company s evaluation
of the type and severity of individual claims and future developments based on historical trends. Changes in assumptions could potentially
have a material effect on the provision for workers compensation and liability claims. Additionally, if any claim were to exceed
our coverage limits, we would have to accrue for and pay the excess amount, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial
condition, results of operations and cash flows. 

28 

Property and equipment 

Property and equipment are
carried at cost. Depreciation of property and equipment is computed using the straight-line method for financial reporting purposes
and accelerated methods for tax purposes over the estimated useful lives of the related assets (net of estimated salvage value or trade-in value).
We generally use estimated useful lives of five to ten years for trucks and trailers, classified as transportation equipment. The
depreciable lives of our revenue equipment represent the estimated usage period of the equipment, which may be less than the economic
lives. 

Periodically, we evaluate
the useful lives and salvage values of our revenue equipment and other long-lived assets based upon, but not limited to, our experience
with similar assets including gains or losses upon dispositions of such assets, conditions in the used equipment market and prevailing
industry practices. Changes in useful lives or salvage value estimates, or fluctuations in market values that are not reflected in our
estimates, could have a material impact on our financial results. We review our property and equipment whenever events or circumstances
indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. An impairment loss equal to the excess of carrying amount over fair
value would be recognized if the carrying amount of the asset is not recoverable. 

Business Combinations
 The Company accounts for business combinations using the acquisition method pursuant to ASC 805,
Business Combinations. For each acquisition, the Company recognizes the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their respective
fair values as of the acquisition date. Valuations of certain assets acquired, including customer relationships, developed technology
and trade names involve significant judgment and estimation. The Company uses independent valuation specialists to help determine fair
value of certain assets and liabilities. Valuations utilize significant estimates, such as forecasted revenues and profits. Changes in
these estimates could significantly impact on the value of certain assets and liabilities. ASC 805 establishes a measurement period to
provide the Company with a reasonable amount of time to obtain the information necessary to identify and measure various items in a business
combination and cannot extend beyond one year from the acquisition date. Measurement period adjustments are recognized in the reporting
period in which the adjustments are determined and calculated as if the accounting had been completed as of the acquisition date. The
Company expects to complete the final fair value determination of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as soon as practicable
within the measurement period, but not to exceed one year from the acquisition date. 

Goodwill Goodwill
is recorded when the purchase price paid in a business combination exceeds the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed.
Goodwill is reviewed for impairment on an annual basis, or upon an occurrence of an event or changes in circumstances that indicate that
the carrying value may not be recoverable. In the absence of any indications of potential impairment, the evaluation of goodwill is performed
during the fourth quarter of each year. 

Goodwill impairment is the
amount by which a reporting unit s carrying value exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill. When testing
goodwill for impairment, the Company may first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether the fair value of a reporting unit
is less than its carrying amount. The Company then completes a quantitative impairment test if the qualitative assessment indicates that
it is more likely than not that the reporting unit s fair value is less than the carrying value of its assets. If the estimated
fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value, goodwill is not considered impaired, and no additional steps are needed.
If, however, the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, then the amount of the impairment loss is the amount
by which the reporting unit s carrying value exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill. 

29 

Income taxes Income
taxes are accounted for under the asset-and-liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future
tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and
their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted
tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or
settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized as income or expense in the period
that includes the enactment date. 

We evaluate the need for
a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets based on whether we believe that it is more likely than not all deferred tax assets will
be realized. A consideration of future taxable income is made as well as on-going prudent feasible tax planning strategies in assessing
the need for valuation allowances. In the event it is determined all or part of a deferred tax asset would not be able to be realized,
management would record an adjustment to the deferred tax asset and recognize a charge against income at that time. 

Our estimates of the potential
outcome of any uncertain tax issue is subject to our assessment of relevant risks, facts and circumstances existing at that time. We
account for uncertain tax positions in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ASC 740, Income Taxes, and record
a liability when such uncertainties meet the more likely than not recognition threshold. Potential accrued interest and penalties related
to unrecognized tax benefits are recognized as a component of income tax expense. 

Reportable Segments 

Our business is organized
into two operating segments, Company Drivers and Brokered, which represent the Company s reportable segments. The Company Drivers
segment offers automobile transport and contract services under an asset-based model. The Company s contract service offering
devotes the use of equipment to specific customers and provides transportation services through long-term contracts. The Company s
Brokered segment offers transportation services utilizing an asset-light model focusing on outsourcing transportation of loads to
third-party carriers. 

Company Drivers Segment 

In our Company Drivers Segment,
we generate revenue by transporting autos for our customers under our OEM contract arrangements and our contract services arrangements.
Our OEM contract arrangements provide automobile transportation services through movements of autos over routes across the United States.
Our Company Drivers segment provides services that are geographically diversified but have similar economic and other relevant characteristics,
as they all provide Company Drivers carrier services of automobiles. The main factors that affect operating revenue in the Company Drivers
Segment are the average revenue per mile received from customers, the percentage of miles for which we are compensated and the number
of vehicles transported. 

We are typically paid a predetermined rate per unit for our Company
Drivers services. Our executed contracts contain fixed terms and rates and are often used by our customers with high-service and
high-priority freight. We continually strive to increase our revenues derived from contracts as a percentage of total revenue by
continuing to build upon our existing relations and acquire new relations with OEMs. 

Our contracts with customers
in the Company Drivers segment generally include a fuel surcharge to account for fluctuating fuel prices. Built into our predetermined
contract rates with each customer is a baseline fuel price and when fuel prices rise above this baseline price our customers compensate
us for the variance in the form of additional revenue. If fuel prices drop below the baseline price, we in turn owe our customers this
variance and record a discount. This additional revenue/discount is represented on the Fuel Surcharge and Other Reimbursements line in
our condensed consolidated financial statements. Fuel surcharge revenue mitigates the effect of price increases over the life of the
contract; however, these revenues may not fully protect us from all fuel price increases. Conversely, any discount related to a decline
in fuel prices mitigates any upside we would otherwise experience from such decline. 

In our Company Drivers segment,
our most significant operating expenses vary with miles traveled and include (i) fuel, and (ii) driver related expenses, such
as wages, benefits, training and recruitment. Expenses that have both fixed and variable components include maintenance and tire expense
and our total cost of insurance and claims. These expenses generally vary with the miles we travel, but also have a controllable component
based on safety, fleet age, efficiency and other factors. Our main fixed costs include depreciation of long-term assets, such as
trucks and trailers (to which we refer as revenue equipment) and service center facilities, the compensation of non-driver personnel
and other general and administrative expenses. 

30 

Our Company Drivers segment
requires substantial capital expenditures for purchase of new revenue equipment. We use a combination of financing leases and secured
long-term debt to acquire revenue equipment. When we finance revenue equipment acquisitions with either finance leases or long-term debt,
the asset and liability are recorded on our consolidated balance sheet, and we record expense under Depreciation and Interest
expense. We expect our depreciation and interest expense will be impacted by changes in the percentage of our revenue equipment
acquired in any given year. 

Brokered Segment 

In our Brokered segment,
we retain the customer relationship, including billing and collection, and we outsource the transportation of the loads to third-party carriers.
For this segment, we rely on the company s brokerage department to procure spot buy arrangement contracts, and to match loads and
carriers via the Company s information systems. This segment also includes revenue generated by our owner-operators and some
third-party carriers who haul autos for our OEM and contract customers. 

Our Brokered segment revenue
is mainly derived from our customers requiring additional transportation needs to haul autos as their current carriers cannot meet their
demands. The main factors that affect operating revenue in our Brokered segment are our customers excess inventory needs, the
rates we obtain from customers, the auto volumes we ship through our third-party carriers and our ability to secure third-party carriers
to transport customer autos. We generally do not have contracted long-term rates for the cost of third-party carriers, and
we cannot assure that our results of operations will not be adversely impacted in the future if our ability to obtain third-party carriers
changes or the rates of such providers increase. 

The most significant expense
of our Brokered segment, which is primarily variable, is the cost of purchased transportation that we pay to third-party carriers
and is included in the Purchased transportation line item. This expense generally varies directly with the amount of Brokered
revenue, rates charged by third party carriers and current demand and customer shipping needs. Other operating expenses are generally
fixed and primarily include the compensation and benefits of non-driver personnel (which are recorded in the Salaries, wages
and benefits line item). 

The primary performance indicator
in our Brokered segment is operating margin (brokered operating revenue, less brokered operating expenses, as a percentage of brokered
operating revenue). Operating margin can be impacted by the rates charged to customers and the rates charged by third-party carriers. 

Our Brokered segment does
not require significant capital expenditures and is not asset-intensive like our Company Drivers segment. 

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 

We report our financial results
in accordance with accounting principles GAAP. However, management believes that EBITDA and Operating Ratio provide useful information
in measuring our operating performance, generating future operating plans and making strategic decisions regarding allocation of capital.
Management believes this information presents helpful comparisons of financial performance between periods by excluding the effect of
certain non-recurring items. 

EBITDA and Operating Ratio
do not have a standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and therefore they may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented
by other companies, and it should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance
with GAAP. 

EBITDA is defined as net
income (loss) for the period adjusted for interest expense, income tax expense (benefit) and depreciation expense and intangible amortization
expense. 

Adjusted EBITDA represents
net income (loss) plus interest expense, income tax expense (benefit), depreciation expense, intangible amortization expense, and share-based
compensation expenses.

Operating Revenue We
generate revenue from two primary sources: transporting autos for its customers (including related fuel surcharge revenue and other reimbursements)
and arranging for the transportation of customer autos by third-party carriers. We have two reportable segments: Company Drivers
segment and Brokered segment. Company Drivers revenue, before fuel surcharges and other reimbursements, is primarily generated through
trucking services provided by our two Company Drivers service offerings: OEM transports and contract. Brokered revenue before fuel surcharges
and other reimbursements is primarily generated through brokering autos to third-party carriers. Fuel surcharges and other reimbursements
represent additional revenue we earn based on mileage driven and other reimbursable costs incurred for which it is compensated by its
customers. 

Our total operating revenue
is affected by, among other things, the general level of economic activity in the United States, customer inventory levels, specific
customer demand, the level of capacity in the Company Drivers and Brokered industry, the success of our marketing and sales efforts and
the availability of drivers and third-party carriers. 

We disaggregate revenue from
contracts with customers for Company Drivers and Brokered operations between (1) revenue, before fuel surcharges and reimbursements (2)
fuel surcharges and reimbursements (3) lease revenue and (4) other revenue. 

33 

Total Operating Revenues Due
to the Successor period including revenues from the acquired entities from May 13, 2024 to September 30, 2024 we are showing an increase
in three and nine month period ended September 30, 2024. In the Successor three months period ended September 2024, our year over year
volumes remain relatively flat but revenue earned per unit decreased resulting in a reduction in revenues when compared to the previous
year s pro forma revenues of the acquired entities. 

Total Operating Expenses Due
to the Successor period including expenses from the acquired entities from May 13, 2024, to September 30, 2024, and the Successor s
expenses for the full 2024 period presented we are showing an increase in in both the three and nine month period ended September 30,
2024. Included in our three and nine months September 30, 2024 operating expenses is stock-based compensation of 1,071,160 and 7,746,796,
respectively. The stock-based compensation is a result of the issuance of restricted stock awards under our 2024 Long-Term Incentive
Plan to retain key employees at the Founding Companies. 

Adjusted
Operating Ratio We noted higher adjusted operating ratios between the three and nine month periods ending September
30, 2024 and 2023 due to the drop in revenue and higher operating expenses. See Non-GAAP Financial Measure section
above for our calculation of Adjusted Operating Ratio.

At the lower level of revenue,
the operating leverage to cover fixed costs declined as reflected in the higher adjusted operating ratio. 

Adjusted EBITDA As
previously mentioned, due to the Successor periods only including financial results for the period May 13, 2024 to September 30, 2024
for the acquired entities this has skewed our comparisons for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. Our Adjusted EBITDA
for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2024 increased for both comparable periods. See Non-GAAP Financial
Measure section above for our calculation of Adjusted EBITDA. 

Liquidity and Capital
Resources 

Overview 

Our business requires substantial
amounts of cash to cover operating expenses as well as to fund capital expenditures, working capital changes, principal and interest
payments on our debt obligations, lease payments and tax payments when we generate taxable income. Recently, we have financed our capital
requirements with cash flows from operating activities, direct equipment financing, and proceeds from our IPO that closed in May 2024.
We intend to purchase approximately twenty-five tractors and trailers in the fourth quarter and plan to finance the purchases through
a combination of operating cash flows and direct equipment financing. 

We believe we can fund our
expected cash needs in the short-term, including debt repayment and the capital purchases described above, with projected cash flows
from operating activities, borrowings under our credit facility and direct debt and lease financing we believe to be available for at
least the next 12 months. Over the long-term, we expect that we will continue to have significant capital requirements, which may
require us to seek additional borrowings or lease financing. The availability of financing will depend upon our financial condition and
results of operations as well as prevailing market conditions. 

Sources of liquidity 

In May 2024, we raised money
in the capital markets through an IPO and then subsequently in June sold additional shares through an over-allotment option. The approximately
 30 million remaining after acquiring the Founding Companies is being used to support operations for 2024 and to partially fund strategic
acquisitions. We anticipate that our cash flows from operations will provide adequate liquidity for our planned capital expenditures
during the remainder of 2024. For any new capital expenditures in 2024 and beyond that exceed our cash flow from operations, we have
negotiated credit agreements with financial institutions in amounts sufficient to fund planned purchases. While we control the timing
and extent of our capital expenditures, there is no assurance can obtain financing arrangements.

Pinnacle LOC 

On November 8, 2024, the Company and certain of
its subsidiaries, as borrowers, entered into a Loan and Security Agreement (the Loan Agreement with Pinnacle Bank, as lender
(the Lender ). The Loan Agreement provides for (i) a delayed draw term loan facility of up to an aggregate principal amount
of 25 million (the Term Loan Facility and (ii) a revolving credit facility of up to an aggregate principal amount of 20
million at any time outstanding (the Revolving Credit Facility ), in each case, subject to the terms of the Loan Agreement.
Proceeds of the Term Loan Facility may be used to refinance existing indebtedness of the Company, to finance certain permitted acquisitions
and fees and expenses related thereto, and to pay fees and transaction expenses associated with the Loan Agreement. Proceeds of the Revolving
Credit Facility may be used for general working capital, to pay the fees and transaction expenses associated with the Loan Agreement,
and to pay any of the Company s obligations thereunder. The loans under the Loan Agreement may be voluntarily prepaid at any time,
in whole or in part, without premium or penalty. The maturity date of the maturity date of the Term Loan Facility is May 8, 2031, and
the maturity date of the Revolving Credit Facility is November 8, 2029. 

Borrowings under the Loan Agreement bear interest
at a rate per annum equal to Term SOFR for an interest period equal to one month plus a margin of (x) 2.50 per annum with respect to
any loan under the Term Loan Facility and (y) 2.20 per annum with respect to any loan under the Revolving Credit Facility. In addition,
the Company is required to pay an unused line fee on the unutilized commitments with respect to the Revolving Credit Facility at the rate
of 0.15 per annum. 

The Loan Agreement contains customary affirmative
and negative covenants, including covenants that restrict the ability of the Company and its subsidiaries to, among other things, incur
debt, grant liens on their respective assets, engage in mergers and other fundamental changes, make investments, enter into transactions
with affiliates, pay dividends and make other restricted payments, prepay other indebtedness and sell assets, in each case subject to
certain exceptions set forth in the Loan Agreement. The Loan Agreement also requires the Company to maintain (i) a Fixed Charge Coverage
Ratio (as defined in the Loan Agreement) of greater than or equal to 1.25 to 1.00 and (ii) a Funded Debt to Adjusted EBITDA Ratio (as
defined in the Loan Agreement) of less than or equal to 3.00 to 1.00, in each case, as of the end of each fiscal quarter, commencing with
the fiscal quarter ending March 31, 2025. 

All obligations under the Loan Agreement and the
guarantees of those obligations are secured, subject to certain exceptions, by a security interest on substantially all of the property
of the Company and its subsidiaries. 

Upon closing, the Company
drew 16.0 million from the available term debt, a portion of which was used to repay and terminate the Proficient Transport line of credit. 

Cash Flows 

For the nine months ended
September 30, 2024, cash flows from operating activities of 7,768,100, a 1,745,733 increase compared to the nine months ended September
30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to increased earnings before non-cash charges including depreciation, intangible amortization
and stock compensation, net of the adjustment of earnout contingency which was partly offset by an increase in prepaid expenses and other
assets and a decrease in accounts payable. 

For the nine months ended
September 30, 2024, cash flows used in investing activities was 201,829,965. This increase of 201,731,581 compared to September 30,
2023 is mainly due to the cash paid to acquire the Founding Companies and ATG as discussed above in Note 3 Business Combinations. 

For the nine months ended
September 30, 2024, cash flows provided by financing activities was 210,451,847, which was an increase of 216,375,171 compared to the
nine months ended September 30, 2023. This increase is due to our issuance of common stock in the Company s IPO plus proceeds from
debt. 

Emerging Growth Company Status 

We qualify as an emerging
growth company, as defined in the JOBS Act. As an emerging growth company, we may take advantage of specified reduced disclosure
and other requirements that are otherwise applicable generally to public companies. These provisions include: (i) reduced disclosure
about our executive compensation arrangements; (ii) not being required to hold advisory votes on executive compensation or to obtain
stockholder approval of any golden parachute arrangements not previously approved; (iii) an exemption from the auditor attestation
requirement in the assessment of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002;
and (iv) an exemption from compliance with the requirements of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding the communication
of critical audit matters in the auditor s report on the financial statements. 

We may take advantage of
these exemptions for up to five years or such earlier time that we are no longer an emerging growth company. We would cease to be
an emerging growth company on the date that is the earliest of (i) the last day of the fiscal year in which we have total annual
gross revenues of 1.235 billion or more; (ii) the last day of our fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the
date of the completion of the IPO; (iii) the date on which we have issued more than 1.0 billion in nonconvertible debt during
the previous three years; or (iv) the date on which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer under the rules of the SEC. We
may choose to take advantage of some but not all of these exemptions. We have taken advantage of reduced reporting requirements in this
Quarterly Report. Accordingly, the information contained herein may be different from the information you receive from other public companies
in which you hold stock. Additionally, the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of an extended transition
period for complying with new or revised accounting standards. This allows an emerging growth company to delay the adoption of certain
accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to avail ourselves of this exemption
and, therefore, while we are an emerging growth company, we will not be subject to new or revised accounting standards at the same time
that they become applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies. As a result of this election, our financial
statements may not be comparable to those of other public companies that comply with new or revised accounting pronouncements as of public
company effective dates. We may choose to early adopt any new or revised accounting standards whenever such early adoption is permitted
for private companies.

and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 

None. 

Item 4. Controls and
Procedures 

Disclosure Controls
and Procedures 

Our
management, with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure
controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. The term disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e)
and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), are controls and other procedures
of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits
under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the
Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC ). Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls
and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under
the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including its principal executive and principal financial
officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that controls and procedures,
no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives, and management necessarily
applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. 

Based
on this evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024, our chief executive officer and chief financial
officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective. 

Notwithstanding
the material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded
that our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements present fairly, in all material respects, our financial position, results of operations
and cash flows in accordance with GAAP. 

In
connection with the preparation of the financial statements, a material weakness in Proficient Transport s internal controls over
financial reporting was identified and, if our remediation is not effective, or if we fail to maintain an effective system of internal
controls over financial reporting in the future, we may not be able to accurately or timely report our financial condition or results
of operations, which may adversely affect investor confidence and profitability . 

We have identified a material weakness in Proficient Transport s
internal controls over financial reporting. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal controls
over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial
statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. The material weakness identified was related to IT general controls in
Proficient Transport s financial systems. 

Remediation
steps are being taken designed to improve Proficient Transport s internal controls over financial reporting to address the underlying
causes, including: designing and implementing increased controls, increased oversight and review of technical systems and engaging third-parties.
We continue to work on other remediation initiatives. 

While
we believe that these efforts will improve Proficient Transport s internal controls over financial reporting, the implementation
of these measures is ongoing and will require validation and testing of the design and operating effectiveness of internal controls over
a sustained period of financial reporting cycles. If the steps we take do not remediate the material weaknesses in a timely manner, there
could continue to be a reasonable possibility that these control deficiencies or others could result in a material misstatement of our
annual or interim financial statements that would not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. If we are unable to successfully remediate
our existing or any future material weakness, the accuracy of our financial reporting may be adversely affected, which could cause investors
to lose confidence in our financial reporting and our share price and profitability may decline as a result. 

Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

Except for the enhancements to controls to address the material weakness
discussed above, there were no changes to our internal control over financial reporting during the three months ended September 30, 2024,
that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.

for Lender or its applicable lending office to make, maintain or fund SOFR Loans, or to determine or charge interest rates based upon
the Applicable Rate, or any governmental authority has imposed material restrictions on the authority of Lender to purchase or sell,
or to take deposits of, Dollars in the London interbank market, then, on notice thereof by Lender, any obligation of Lender to make or
continue SOFR Loans shall be suspended until such Lender notifies Borrower that the circumstances giving rise to such determination no
longer exist. 

3.6. Inability to Determine
Rates . If Lender notifies Borrower for any reason in connection with a request for
a Borrowing of, or conversion to or continuation of, a SOFR Loan that adequate and reasonable means do not exist for determining the
Applicable Rate for the requested Interest Period, then the obligation of Lender to make or maintain SOFR Loans shall be suspended until
Lender revokes such notice. 

3.7. Increased
Costs; Capital Adequacy 

3.7.1. Change in Law .
If any Change in Law shall: 

(a) impose,
modify or deem applicable any reserve, liquidity, special deposit, compulsory loan, insurance charge or similar requirement against assets
of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended or participated in by, Lender; 

(b) subject
any Lender to any Tax with respect to any Loan or Loan Document (other than any Indemnified Tax and Excluded Tax), or change the basis
of taxation of payments to such Lender in respect thereof; or 

(c) impose
on any Lender or interbank market any other condition, cost or expense affecting any Loan, Loan Document, or Commitment; 

and the result thereof shall
be to increase the cost to such Lender of making or maintaining any Loan or Commitment, or to reduce the amount of any sum received or
receivable by such Lender hereunder (whether of principal, interest or any other amount) then, upon request of such Lender, Borrowers
will pay to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender for such additional costs incurred or reduction
suffered. 

- 24 - 

3.7.2. Capital Adequacy .
If any Lender determines that any Change in Law affecting such Lender or any lending office of Lender or Lender s holding company,
if any, regarding capital requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on Lender s, or holding company s
capital as a consequence of this Agreement, or Lender s Commitments, Loans or Letters of Credit, to a level below that which Lender
or holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration Lender s and holding company s
policies with respect to capital adequacy), then from time to time Borrower will pay to Lender such additional amount or amounts as will
compensate it or its holding company for any such reduction suffered. 

3.7.3. Compensation .
Failure or delay on the part of Lender to demand compensation pursuant to this Section shall not constitute a waiver of its right to
demand such compensation, but Borrower shall not be required to compensate Lender for any increased costs incurred or reductions suffered
more than nine months prior to the date that the Lender notifies Borrower of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or
reductions and of Lender s intention to claim compensation therefor (except that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased
costs or reductions is retroactive, then the nine-month period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive
effect thereof). 

3.8. Mitigation .
If Lender gives a notice under Section 3.5 or requests compensation under Section 3.7 , or if Borrower is required
to pay additional amounts with respect to Lender under Section 5.8 , then Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate
a different lending office or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or Affiliates, if, in
the judgment of Lender, such designation or assignment (a) would eliminate the need for such notice or reduce amounts payable or to be
withheld in the future, as applicable; and (b) would not subject Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be
disadvantageous to it or unlawful. Borrower shall pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by Lender in connection with any such
designation or assignment. 

3.9. Maximum Interest .
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in any Loan Document, the interest paid or agreed to be paid under the Loan Documents
shall not exceed the maximum rate of non-usurious interest permitted by Applicable Law maximum rate ). If
Lender shall receive interest in an amount that exceeds the maximum rate, the excess interest shall be applied to the principal of the
Obligations or, if it exceeds such unpaid principal, refunded to Borrower. In determining whether the interest contracted for, charged
or received by Lender exceeds the maximum rate, such Person may, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, (a) characterize any payment
that is not principal as an expense, fee or premium rather than interest; (b) exclude voluntary prepayments and the effects thereof;
and (c) amortize, prorate, allocate and spread in equal or unequal parts the total amount of interest throughout the contemplated term
of the Obligations hereunder.

Borrower; and (ii) the proceeds of each Revolver Loan requested under Section 4.1.1(i)(b) or Section 4.1.1(i)(c)

Borrower or in payment of any of the Obligations shall be deemed to have been received by each Borrower. 

(iv) Notices . Borrower
shall request a Borrowing by prompt delivery to Lender of the required Notice of Borrowing duly executed by an authorized officer of

all Liens, rights and remedies relating thereto, shall be revived and continued in full force and effect as if such payment had not been
made or such setoff had not occurred. 

5.6. Application
and Allocation of Payments. 

5.6.1. Application .
Payments made by Borrower hereunder shall be applied (a) first, as specifically required hereby; (b) second, to Obligations then due

Account evidencing the Debt of Borrower to Lender resulting from each Loan owing to Lender from time to time, including
the amount of principal and interest payable to Lender from time to time hereunder and under each Note payable to Lender. Any failure
of Lender to record in the Loan Account, or any error in doing so, shall not limit or otherwise affect the obligation of Borrower hereunder
(or under any Note) to pay any amount owing hereunder to Lender. 

5.7.2.
 [Reserved] . 

5.7.3.
 Entries Binding . The entries made in the Loan Account shall constitute rebuttable presumptive
evidence of the information contained therein; provided, however, that if a copy of information contained in the Loan Account is provided
to any Person, or any Person inspects the Loan Account, at any time or from time to time, then the information contained in the Loan
Account, as applicable, shall be conclusive and binding on such Person for all purposes absent manifest error, unless such Person notifies
Lender in writing within 30 days after such Person s receipt of such copy or such Person s inspection of the Loan Account
of its intention to dispute the information contained therein. 

5.8. Taxes. 

5.8.1. Payments Free of
Taxes . All payments by Obligors of Obligations shall be free and clear of and without
reduction for any Taxes. If Applicable Law requires any Obligor to withhold or deduct any Tax (including backup withholding or withholding
Tax), then the applicable Obligor shall be entitled to make such withholding or deduction and shall pay the amount withheld or deducted
to the relevant governmental authority. If the withholding or deduction is made on account of Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes, the sum
payable by the applicable Obligor shall be increased so that Lender receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received if no
such withholding or deduction (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section) had been made. Without
limiting the foregoing, Borrower shall timely pay all Other Taxes to the relevant governmental authorities. 

5.8.2. Payment .
Borrower shall indemnify, hold harmless and reimburse (within 10 days after demand therefor) Lender for any Indemnified Taxes or
Other Taxes (including those attributable to amounts payable under this Section) withheld or deducted by any Obligor or Lender, or paid
by Lender, with respect to any Obligations, Letters of Credit or Loan Documents, whether or not such Taxes were properly asserted by
the relevant governmental authority, and including all penalties, interest and reasonable expenses relating thereto. A certificate as
to the amount of any such payment or liability delivered to Borrower by Lender shall be conclusive, absent manifest error. As soon as
practicable after any payment of Taxes by a Borrower, Borrower shall deliver to Lender a receipt from the governmental authority or other
evidence of payment satisfactory to Lender. 

5.8.3. Treatment
of Certain Refunds. If any party determines, in its sole discretion exercised in good faith, that it has received a refund of any
Taxes as to which it has been indemnified pursuant to this Section 5.8 (including by the payment of additional amounts pursuant to this
Section 5.8), it shall pay to the indemnifying party an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made
under this Section 5.8 with respect to the Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses (including Taxes) of such
indemnified party and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant governmental authority with respect to such refund).
Such indemnifying party, upon the request of such indemnified party, shall repay to such indemnified party the amount paid over pursuant
to this Section 5.8.3 (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant governmental authority) in the event that
such indemnified party is required to repay such refund to such governmental authority. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Section 5.8.3, in no event will the indemnified party be required to pay any amount to an indemnifying party pursuant to this Section
5.8.3 the payment of which would place the indemnified party in a less favorable net after-Tax position than the indemnified party would
have been in if the Tax subject to indemnification and giving rise to such refund had not been deducted, withheld or otherwise imposed
and the indemnification payments or additional amounts with respect to such Tax had never been paid. This paragraph shall not be construed
to require any indemnified party to make available its Tax returns (or any other information relating to its Taxes that it deems confidential)
to the indemnifying party or any other Person. 

- 29 - 

5.9. Lender
Tax Information. 

5.9.1. Status of Lender .
Lender shall deliver documentation and information to Borrower, at the times and in form required by Applicable Law or requested by Borrower,
sufficient to permit Borrower to determine (a) whether or not payments made with respect to Obligations are subject to Taxes, (b) if
applicable, the required rate of withholding or deduction, and (c) such Lender s entitlement to any available exemption from, or
reduction of, applicable Taxes for such payments or otherwise to establish such Lender s status for withholding tax purposes in
the applicable jurisdiction. 

5.9.2. Documentation .
If a Borrower is resident for tax purposes in the United States, Lender, as a United States person within the meaning of
section 7701(a)(30) of the Code, shall deliver to Borrower IRS Form W-9 or such other documentation or information prescribed by Applicable
Law or requested by Borrower to determine whether Lender is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements. 

5.9.3. Lender Obligations .
Lender shall promptly notify Borrower of any change in circumstances that would change any claimed Tax exemption or reduction. Lender
shall indemnify, hold harmless and reimburse (within 10 days after demand therefor) Borrower for any Taxes, losses, claims, liabilities,
penalties, interest and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees) incurred by or asserted against a Borrower by any governmental
authority due to such Lender s failure to deliver, or inaccuracy or deficiency in, any documentation required to be delivered by
it pursuant to this Section 5.9 . 

5.10. Nature
and Extent of Borrower s Liability. 

5.10.1. Liability .
Borrower agrees that it is liable for, and absolutely and unconditionally guarantees to Lender the prompt payment and performance of
all Obligations. Borrower agrees that its Obligations shall not be discharged until Full Payment of the Obligations, and that such obligations
are absolute and unconditional, irrespective of (a) the genuineness, validity, regularity, enforceability, subordination or any future
modification of, or change in, any Obligations or Loan Document, or any other document, instrument or agreement to which any Obligor
is or may become a party or be bound; (b) the absence of any action to enforce this Agreement (including this Section) or any other
Loan Document, or any waiver, consent or indulgence of any kind by Lender with respect thereto; (c) the existence, value or condition
of, or failure to perfect a Lien or to preserve rights against, any security or guaranty for the Obligations or any action, or the absence
of any action, by Lender in respect thereof (including the release of any security or guaranty); (d) the insolvency of any Obligor; (e) any
election by Lender in an Insolvency Proceeding for the application of Section 1111(b)(2) of the Bankruptcy Code; (f) any borrowing
or grant of a Lien by any other Borrower, as debtor-in-possession under Section 364 of the Bankruptcy Code or otherwise; (g) the disallowance
of any claims of Lender against any Obligor for the repayment of any Obligations under Section 502 of the Bankruptcy Code or otherwise;
or (h) any other action or circumstances that might otherwise constitute a legal or equitable discharge or defense of a surety or guarantor,
except Full Payment of all Obligations. 

5.10.2. Waivers. 

(a) Borrower
expressly waives all rights that it may have now or in the future under any statute, at common law, in equity or otherwise, to compel
Lender to marshal assets or to proceed against any Obligor, other Person or security for the payment or performance of any Obligations
before, or as a condition to, proceeding against such Borrower. Borrower waives all defenses available to a surety, guarantor or accommodation
co-obligor other than Full Payment of all Obligations and waives, to the maximum extent permitted by law, any right to revoke any guaranty
of any Obligations as long as it is a Borrower. It is agreed among Borrower and Lender that the provisions of this Section 5.10 
are of the essence of the transaction contemplated by the Loan Documents and that, but for such provisions, Lender would decline to make
Loans and issue Letters of Credit. 

- 30 - 

(b) Lender
may, in their discretion, pursue such rights and remedies as they deem appropriate, including realization upon Collateral or any real
estate by judicial foreclosure or nonjudicial sale or enforcement, without affecting any rights and remedies under this Section 5.10 .
If, in taking any action in connection with the exercise of any rights or remedies, Lender shall forfeit any other rights or remedies,
including the right to enter a deficiency judgment against Borrower or other Person, whether because of any Applicable Laws pertaining
to election of remedies or otherwise, Borrower consents to such action and waives any claim based upon it, even if the action
may result in loss of any rights of subrogation that Borrower might otherwise have had. Any election of remedies that results in denial
or impairment of the right of Lender to seek a deficiency judgment against Borrower shall not impair any other Borrower s obligation
to pay the full amount of the Obligations. Borrower waives all rights and defenses arising out of an election of remedies, such as nonjudicial
foreclosure with respect to any security for the Obligations, even though that election of remedies destroys such Borrower s rights
of subrogation against any other Person. Lender may bid all or a portion of the Obligations at any foreclosure, trustee or other sale,
including any private sale, and the amount of such bid need not be paid by Lender but shall be credited against the Obligations. The amount
of the successful bid at any such sale, whether Lender or any other Person is the successful bidder, shall be conclusively deemed to be
the fair market value of the Collateral, and the difference between such bid amount and the remaining balance of the Obligations shall
be conclusively deemed to be the amount of the Obligations guaranteed under this Section 5.10 , notwithstanding that any present
or future law or court decision may have the effect of reducing the amount of any deficiency claim to which Lender might otherwise be
entitled but for such bidding at any such sale. 

5.10.3. Subordination .
Borrower hereby subordinates any claims, including any rights at law or in equity to payment, subrogation, reimbursement, exoneration,
contribution, indemnification or set off, that it may have at any time against any other Obligor, howsoever arising, to the Full Payment
of all Obligations.

6.2.3. Effect of Termination .
On the effective date of termination of the Commitments by Lender or by Borrower as provided in this Section 6.2 , all of the Obligations

of the Obligations. Notwithstanding the Full Payment of the Obligations, Lender shall not be required to terminate its Liens in any of
the Collateral unless, with respect to any loss or damage Lender may incur as a result of the dishonor or return of any Payment
Items applied to the Obligations, Lender shall have received either (i) a written agreement, executed by Borrower indemnifying Lender
from any such loss or damage; or (ii) such monetary reserves and Liens on the Collateral for such period of time as Lender, in its
discretion, may reasonably deem necessary to protect Lender from any such loss or damage. The provisions of Sections 3.4, 3.7,
5.5, 5.8 and this Section 6.2.3 and all obligations of Borrower to indemnify Lender pursuant to this Agreement or any of the
other Loan Documents, shall in all events survive any termination of the Commitments and Full Payment of the Obligations.

or such lesser sum as may constitute the outstanding principal amount of all Revolver Loans pursuant to the terms of the Loan Agreement
(as defined below) on the date on which such outstanding principal amounts become due and payable pursuant to Section 5.2 
of the Loan Agreement, in strict accordance with the terms thereof. Borrower likewise unconditionally, and jointly and severally, promise
to pay to Holder interest from and after the date hereof on the outstanding principal amount of Revolver Loans at such interest rates,
payable at such times, and computed in such manner as are specified in Section 3.1 of the Loan Agreement, in strict accordance
with the terms thereof. 

This Revolver Note Note is issued pursuant to, and is the Revolver Note referred to in, the Loan and Security Agreement dated of even

and Holder is and shall be entitled to all benefits thereof and of all Loan Documents executed and delivered in connection therewith.
This Note is subject to certain restrictions on transfer or assignment as provided in the Loan Agreement. All capitalized terms used herein,
unless otherwise defined herein, shall have the meanings ascribed to such terms in the Loan Agreement. 

The repayment of the principal
balance of this Note is subject to the provisions of Section 5.2 of the Loan Agreement. The entire unpaid principal balance
and all accrued interest on this Note shall be due and payable immediately upon the termination of the Revolver Commitment as set forth
in Section 6.2 of the Loan Agreement. 

All payments of principal
and interest shall be made in Dollars in immediately available funds as specified in the Loan Agreement. 

Upon or after the occurrence
of an Event of Default and for so long as such Event of Default exists, the principal balance and all accrued interest of this Note may
be declared (or shall become) due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Loan Agreement, and the unpaid principal
balance hereof shall bear interest at the Default Rate as and when provided in Section 3.1 of the Loan Agreement. Borrower
jointly and severally agree to pay, and save Holder harmless against, any liability for the payment of, all costs and expenses, including,
but not limited to, reasonable attorneys fees, if this Note is collected by or through an attorney-at-law.

In no contingency or event
whatsoever, whether by reason of advancement of the proceeds hereof or otherwise, shall the amount paid or agreed to be paid to Holder
for the use, forbearance or detention of money advanced hereunder exceed the highest lawful rate permissible under any law which a court
of competent jurisdiction may deem applicable hereto; and, in the event of any such payment inadvertently paid by Borrower or inadvertently
received by Holder, such excess sum shall be, at Borrower s option, returned to Borrower forthwith or credited as a payment of principal,

Wherever possible each provision
of this Note shall be interpreted in such a manner as to be effective and valid under Applicable Law, but if any provision of this Note
shall be prohibited or invalid under Applicable Law, such provision shall be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or invalidity
without invalidating the remainder of such provision or remaining provisions of this Note. No delay or failure on the part of Holder in
the exercise of any right or remedy hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor as an acquiescence in any default, nor shall any
single or partial exercise by Holder of any right or remedy preclude any other right or remedy. Holder, at its option, may enforce its
rights against any Collateral securing this Note without Holder enforcing its rights against Borrower, any Guarantor of the indebtedness
evidenced hereby or any other property or indebtedness due or to become due to Borrower. Borrower agrees that, without releasing or impairing
Borrower s liability hereunder, Holder may at any time release, surrender, substitute or exchange any Collateral securing this Note
and may at any time release any party primarily or secondarily liable for the indebtedness evidenced by this Note. 

The rights of Holder and obligations
of Borrower hereunder shall be construed in accordance with and governed by the laws (without giving effect to the conflict of law principles
thereof) of the State of Florida. This Note is intended to take effect as an instrument under seal under Florida law.
