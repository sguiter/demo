During the three months ended October 31, 2024, and 2023, the Company incurred total operating expenses of 255,992 and 276,212 respectively. During the three months ended October 31, 2024, management and consulting fees reflected a decrease from 140,500 (2023) to 125,500 (2024) due to a reduction in consulting fees related to investor relations. Amounts incurred for accounting, audit and legal fees had a small increase period over period and totaled 28,254 (2024) and 22,500 (2023), respectively. During the three months ended October 31, 2024 and 2023 research and development fees incurred were 86,081 and 107,603 respectively as the Company continued to conclude upgrades to its software suite. Fees declined over the comparative periods as a result of completion of certain stages of development and the concurrent reduction to required man hours allocated to research and development in the current three-month period ended October 31, 2024. Other operating and general and administrative expenses increased period over period from 5,609 in the three months ended October 31, 2023, to 16,157 for the three months ended October 31, 2024, mainly due to an increase in computer and internet and travel expenses. The Company recorded cumulative interest expenses of 19,319 and 18,279 in respect of certain convertible notes and other loan agreements, respectively during the three months ended October 31, 2024, and 2023. The net loss for the three months ended October 31, 2024 was 275,311, as compared to 294,491 in the three months ended October 31, 2023. Nine months ended October 31, 2024 and 2023 For the Nine Months Ended October 31, 2024 2023 Revenue - - Operating Expenses Cost of revenue Depreciation Legal, accounting and audit fees 95,564 108,858 Management and consulting fees 377,781 441,833 Research, development, and promotion 252,040 321,253 Office supplies and other general expenses 36,594 37,087 Total operating expenses 761,979 909,031 Net operating loss (761,979 (909,031 Other income (expenses) Interest income Interest expense (29,209 (29,102 Interest expense, related parties (27,831 (24,460 Total other income (expenses) (57,040 (53,562 Net loss (819,019 (962,593 6 Table of Contents During each of the nine months ended October 31, 2024, and 2023, the Company has generated 0 in total revenue. During the nine months ended October 31, 2024, and 2023, the Company incurred total operating expenses of 761,979 and 909,031 respectively. During the nine months ended October 31, 2024 management and consulting fees reflected a decrease from 441,833 (2023) to 377,781 (2024) mainly due to a reduction in investor relations fees and a reduction in management fees. Amounts incurred for accounting, audit and legal fees decreased period over period and totaled 95,564 (2024) and 108,858 (2023), respectively, with the decrease predominantly relating to a decrease in fees incurred from our independent public registered accounting firm. During the nine months ended October 31, 2024 and 2023 research and development fees incurred were 252,040 and 321,253 respectively as the Company continued to conclude upgrades to its software suite. Fees declined over the comparative periods as a result of completion of certain stages of development and the concurrent reduction to required man hours allocated to research and development in the current nine-month period ended October 31, 2024. Other operating and general and administrative expenses decreased slightly period over period from 37,087 in the nine months ended October 31, 2023 to 36,594 for the nine months ended October 31, 2024. The Company recorded cumulative interest expenses of 57,040 and 53,562 in respect of certain convertible notes and other loan agreements, respectively during the nine months ended October 31, 2024, and 2023. The net loss for the nine months ended October 31, 2024 was 819,019, as compared to 962,593 in the nine months ended October 31, 2023. Currently a significant portion of our total operating expenses are from management and consultant fees. Several costs have been incurred in order to bring our regulatory product to market, including programming of technology, build out of needed infrastructure for customers including sand-boxes, build out of training materials including educational and instructional videos which are housed within our website, generation of marketing materials, as well as efforts to meet, and present, our product before various regulators in various jurisdictions, both foreign and domestic. Statements of Cash Flows for the Nine Months ended October 31, 2024 and 2023 The Company used net cash in operations of 215,027 and 247,120 respectively during the nine-month periods ended October 31, 2024 and 2023 due to a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses from 454,945 (2023) to 366,232 (2024), and a decrease in related party payables from 246,528 (2023) to 237,760 (2024). The Company received cash from financing activities of 217,021 (2024) and 249,120 (2023), as a result of proceeds from related party loans. Plan of Operation The Company changed the focus of its business at the close of fiscal 2016 to operate in the eco-friendly technology sector using social media sites and offering apps to generate advertising revenues and download fees, and to development certain enterprise software for the cannabis industry. During fiscal 2017 the Company laid the groundwork for income generation from these services by investing in ongoing development of its applications, websites and visibility in both the local and global market. The Company has invested heavily in advertising to allow its applications and ecommerce website visibility on a global stage. During fiscal 2018 we further added to our business portfolio with the acquisition of Ga-Du corporation and its in house software offerings. In each of the years ended January 31, 2021 through 2024, and in the nine months ended October 31, 2024 the Company has continued to incur costs to expand and develop its Herbo software suite of offerings. The Company s need for ongoing capital by way of loans, sale of equity and/or convertible notes is expected to continue during the current fiscal year until we can establish revenues from operations to cover all operational overhead. We have also had to rely heavily on loans from related parties in our most recently completed fiscal years as we work to have our shares returned for quotation on the OTC Markets. There are no assurances additional capital will be available to the Company on acceptable terms or that this equity line will be available to us when needed. Future funding could result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities, the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities and/or amortization expenses related to goodwill and other intangible assets, which could materially adversely affect the Company s business, results of operations and financial condition. Any future funding might require the Company to obtain additional equity or debt financing, which might not be available on terms favorable to the Company, or at all, and such financing, if available, might be dilutive. 7 Table of Contents Going Concern These unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which implies that the Company will continue to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has not generated significant revenues to date and has never paid any dividends and is unlikely to pay dividends or generate significant earnings in the immediate or foreseeable future. As of October 31, 2024, the Company had a working capital deficit of approximately 16 million and an accumulated deficit of approximately 78 million. The continuation of the Company as a going concern is dependent upon the continued financial support from its shareholders, the ability to raise equity or debt financing, and the attainment of profitable operations from the Company s future business. These factors raise substantial doubt regarding the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The unaudited consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments consisting of normal recurring adjustments, which, in the opinion of management, are necessary for a fair presentation of the results for the periods shown. The financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded assets, or the amounts of and classification of liabilities that might be necessary in the event the Company cannot continue in existence. Liquidity and Capital Resources As of October 31, 2024 and January 31, 2024, the Company had 4,100 and 2,106 respectively, in cash for total current assets of 4,100 and 2,106. As at October 31, 2024 and January 31, 2024, the Company had intangible assets of 100,000. At each of October 31, 2024 and January 31, 2024, the Company had total assets of 104,100 and 102,106 respectively. Total liabilities at October 31, 2024 and January 31, 2024 were 16,383,703 and 15,562,690 respectively. The Company has insufficient funds to meet its ongoing operations and is currently funded through loans and advances from our CEO and CFO, Mr., Michael Rountree. The Company has limited financial resources available outside loans from its officers and directors and funds it has previously obtained through use of convertible notes and loans from related parties. There can be no guarantee the Company will continue to receive proceeds from loans, related party advances or convertible notes sufficient to meet its ongoing operational overheads as we continue to implement our business plan. While we generated modest revenue in fiscal 2022, we did not report any revenue in fiscal 2024 or in the nine months ended October 31, 2024 as we continued to enhance our software suite and we do not yet have resources to meet our operational shortfalls. Without realization of additional capital, it would be unlikely for the Company to continue as a going concern. As noted, additional working capital may be sought through additional debt or equity private placements, additional notes payable to banks or related parties (officers, directors or stockholders), or from other available funding sources at market rates of interest, or a combination of these. The ability to raise necessary financing will depend on many factors, including the nature and prospects of any business to be acquired and the economic and market conditions prevailing at the time financing is sought. During the most recently completed fiscal year management has obtained additional funding with success, however there is no guarantee we will be able to continue to obtain financing if and when required. The current economic downturn may make it difficult to find new capital sources for the Company should they be required. Future Financings We anticipate continuing to rely on related party and third-party loans and equity sales of our common shares and/or shares for services rendered in order to continue to fund our business operations in the event of ongoing operational shortfalls. Issuances of additional shares will result in dilution to our existing shareholders. There is no assurance that we will achieve any additional sales of our equity securities or arrange for debt or other financing to fund our research and development activities. Contractual Obligations As a smaller reporting company , the Company is not required to provide tabular disclosure obligations. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements The Company has no significant off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on the Company s financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to stockholders. 8 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Policies The discussion and analysis of the Company s financial condition and results of operations are based upon the Company s consolidated audited financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. These estimates and assumptions are affected by management s application of accounting policies. The Company believes that understanding the basis and nature of the estimates and assumptions involved with the following aspects of the Company s financial statements is critical to an understanding of its consolidated financial statements. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with United States generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The Company regularly evaluates estimates and assumptions related to long-lived assets and deferred income tax asset valuation allowances. The Company bases its estimates and assumptions on current facts, historical experience and various other factors that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the accrual of costs and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. The actual results experienced by the Company may differ materially and adversely from the Company s estimates. To the extent there are material differences between the estimates and the actual results, future results of operations will be affected. Revenue Recognition Under ASC 606, the Company recognizes revenue from licensing agreements and contracts by applying the following steps: (1) identify the contract with a customer; (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determine the transaction price; (4) allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation in the contract; and (5) recognize revenue when each performance obligation is satisfied. For the comparative periods, revenue has not been adjusted and continues to be reported under ASC 605 Revenue Recognition. Under ASC 605, revenue is recognized when the following criteria are met: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (2) the performance of service has been rendered to a customer or delivery has occurred; (3) the amount of fee to be paid by a customer is fixed and determinable; and (4) the collectability of the fee is reasonably assured. 0 has been recognized as revenue in the nine months ended October 31, 2024 and 2023. Revenue generated under enterprise software licenses will be recorded in accordance with the terms of the individual Customer contracts. We expect license fees will be recorded on a monthly basis over the term of the contract, activation fees will be earned upon completion of set up and installation of the enterprise software, and customization and/or professional consulting services will be earned as rendered. Cost of Revenue Costs of revenue consist of the direct expenses incurred to generate revenue. Such costs are recorded as incurred. Our cost of revenue consists primarily of fees associated with the operational charges related to our Herbo enterprise software. During the three and nine months ended October 31, 2024, and 2023 we did not record any sales of our Herbo software suite. 9 Table of Contents Stock-Based Compensation The Company records stock-based compensation in accordance with ASC 718, Share-Based Payments , using the fair value method. All transactions in which goods or services are the consideration received for the issuance of equity instruments are accounted for based on the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instrument issued, whichever is more reliably measurable. Equity instruments issued to employees and the cost of the services received as consideration are measured and recognized based on the fair value of the equity instruments issued. Convertible Debt and Beneficial Conversion Features The Company evaluates embedded conversion features within convertible debt under ASC 815 Derivatives and Hedging to determine whether the embedded conversion feature(s) should be bifurcated from the host instrument and accounted for as a derivative at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in earnings. If the conversion feature does not require derivative treatment under ASC 815, the instrument is evaluated under ASC 470-20 Debt with Conversion and Other Options for consideration of any beneficial conversion features. Stock Settled Debt In certain instances, the Company will issue convertible notes which contain a provision in which the price of the conversion feature is priced at a fixed discount to the trading price of the Company s common shares as traded in the over-the-counter market. In these instances, the Company records a liability, in addition to the principal amount of the convertible note, as stock-settled debt for the fixed value transferred to the convertible note holder from the fixed discount conversion feature. As of October 31, 2024, and January 31, 2024, 248,432 for the value of the stock settled debt for certain convertible notes is included in the Convertible note, net account on the balance sheet. Income Taxes The Company follows ASC 740 Income Taxes, which requires the use of the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under the asset and liability method of ASC 740, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Recently issued accounting pronouncements Accounting pronouncements not listed below were assessed and determined to be not applicable or are expected to have minimal impact on the Company s Consolidated Financial Statements. In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) in order to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet for those leases classified as operating leases under current GAAP. ASU 2016-02 requires that a lessee should recognize a liability to make lease payments (the lease liability) and a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term on the balance sheet. ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, using a modified retrospective approach and early adoption is permitted. The Company adopted ASU 2016-02 on February 1, 2022. The Company had no active leases at the time of adoption. The Company completed its assessment and concluded this update had no material impact on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments ASU 2016-13 ). ASU 2016-13 provides guidance for recognizing credit losses on financial instruments based on an estimate of current expected credit losses model. The amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. Recently, the FASB issued the final ASU to delay adoption for smaller reporting companies for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022. We adopted ASU 2016-13 on February 1, 2023 and it did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 10 Table of Contents In August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06, Debt Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging Contracts in Entity s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity s Own Equity. This ASU amends the guidance on convertible instruments and the derivatives scope exception for contracts in an entity s own equity, and also improves and amends the related earnings per share guidance for both Subtopics. The ASU will be effective for smaller reporting companies for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2023 and interim periods within those annual periods and early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of the new guidance on our consolidated financial statements. In November 2023 , the FASB issued ASU No. 2023 - 07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures, which requires a public entity to disclose significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker CODM ), a description of other segment items by reportable segment, and an explanation of any additional measures the CODM uses in deciding how to allocate resources. The new guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023 and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, and early adoption is permitted. The guidance is to be applied on a retrospective basis, with such disclosures to be made in regard to all prior periods presented in the financial statements. The Company completed its assessment and concluded this update had no material impact on its consolidated financial statements. In December 2023 , the FASB issued ASU No. 2023 - 09, Income Taxes (Topic 470): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures , which are designed to increase the transparency and decision-usefulness of income tax disclosures for financial statement users. The ASU follows investors indication and request for enhanced tax disclosures in order to better assess an entity s operations, related tax risks, jurisdictional tax exposures, and increase transparency regarding tax information through improvements to tax disclosures, specifically rate reconciliation, income taxes paid, and unrecognized tax benefits and certain temporary differences. The new guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024 and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2025, and early adoption is permitted. The guidance is to be applied on a prospective basis, but retrospective application is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this ASU on our consolidated financial statements and disclosures. ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The Company is a smaller reporting Company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Act of 1934 and we are not required to provide the information under this item.

An evaluation was conducted under the supervision and with the participation of our management of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of October 31, 2024. Based on that evaluation, our management concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of such date to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms. Such officer also confirmed that there was no change in our internal control over financial reporting during the nine-month period ended October 31, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There have been no changes in the Company s internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the nine months ended October 31, 2024, that have materially, or are reasonably likely to materially, affect the Company s internal controls over financial reporting. 11 Table of Contents PART II ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS On October 20, 2017, a purported shareholder of the Company, Mr. Ian Bell, filed a verified stockholder derivative complaint against the Individual Defendants in the United States District Court for the District of Hawaii (the First Hawaii Complaint ). On January 11, 2018, a purported shareholder of the Company, Mr. Marc D Annunzio, filed a verified stockholder derivative complaint against the Individual Defendants in the United States District Court for the District of Hawaii (the Second Hawaii Complaint ). On February 9, 2018, the Hawaii federal court consolidated the First Hawaii Complaint and the Second Hawaii Complaint (the Consolidated Hawaii Action ). On December 10, 2018, plaintiffs in the Consolidated Hawaii Action filed their amended complaint (the Amended Hawaii Complaint ). The Company is identified as a nominal defendant, against which no claims are plead. The Amended Hawaii Complaint arises out of alleged materially false and misleading statements or omissions from SEC filings and/or public statements by or on behalf of the Company.
