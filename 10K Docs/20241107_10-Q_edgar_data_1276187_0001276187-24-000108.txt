FERC issued an order on January 20, 2022 setting the matter for hearing before an administrative law judge. The hearing was set to commence on March 6, 2023; as explained below, this FERC proceeding has been stayed.

 Rover and Energy Transfer filed their answer to this order on March 21, 2022, and Enforcement Staff filed a reply on April 20, 2022. Rover and Energy Transfer filed their surreply to this order on May 13, 2022. FERC has taken no further action on the case since that time. 
 The primary contractor (and one of the subcontractors) responsible for the HDD operations of the Tuscarawas River site have agreed to indemnify Rover and the Partnership for any and all losses, including any fines and penalties from government agencies, resulting from their actions in conducting such HDD operations. Given the stage of the proceedings, the Partnership is unable at this time to provide an assessment of the potential outcome or range of potential liability, if any; however, the Partnership believes the indemnity described above will be applicable to the penalty proposed by Enforcement Staff and intends to vigorously defend itself against the subject claims. 
 Other FERC Proceedings 
 By an order issued on January 16, 2019, the FERC initiated a review of Panhandle s then existing rates pursuant to Section 5 of the Natural Gas Act to determine whether the rates charged by Panhandle are just and reasonable and set the matter for hearing. On August 30, 2019, Panhandle filed a general rate proceeding under Section 4 of the Natural Gas Act. The Natural Gas Act Section 5 and Section 4 proceedings were consolidated by order of the Chief Judge on October 1, 2019. The initial decision by the administrative law judge was issued on March 26, 2021, and on December 16, 2022, the FERC issued its order on the initial decision. On January 17, 2023, Panhandle and the Michigan Public Service Commission each filed a request for rehearing of FERC s order on the initial decision, which were denied by operation of law as of February 17, 2023. On March 23, 2023, Panhandle appealed these orders to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit Court of Appeals ), and the Michigan Public Service Commission also subsequently appealed these orders. On April 25, 2023, the Court of Appeals consolidated Panhandle s and Michigan Public Service Commission s appeals and stayed the consolidated appeal proceeding while the FERC further considered the requests for rehearing of its December 16, 2022 order. On September 25, 2023, the FERC issued its order addressing arguments raised on rehearing and compliance, which denied our requests for rehearing. Panhandle filed its Petition for Review with the Court of Appeals regarding the September 25, 2023 order. On October 25, 2023, Panhandle filed a limited request for rehearing of the September 25 order addressing arguments raised on rehearing and compliance, which was subsequently denied by operation of law on November 27, 2023. On November 17, 2023, Panhandle provided refunds to shippers and on November 30, 2023, Panhandle submitted a refund report regarding the consolidated rate proceedings, which was protested by several parties.

Litigation and Contingencies 
 We may, from time to time, be involved in litigation and claims arising out of our operations in the normal course of business. Due to the flammable and combustible nature of natural gas and crude oil, the potential exists for personal injury and/or property damage to occur in connection with their transportation, storage or use. In the ordinary course of business, we are sometimes threatened with or named as a defendant in various lawsuits seeking actual and punitive damages for product liability, personal injury and property damage. We maintain liability insurance with insurers in amounts and with coverage and deductibles management believes are reasonable and prudent, and which are generally accepted in the industry. However, there can be no assurance that the levels of insurance protection currently in effect will continue to be available at reasonable prices or that such levels will remain adequate to protect us from material expenses related to product liability, personal injury or property damage in the future. 
 We or our subsidiaries are parties to various legal proceedings, arbitrations and/or regulatory proceedings incidental to our businesses. For each of these matters, we evaluate the merits of the case, our exposure to the matter, possible legal or settlement strategies, the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome and the availability of insurance coverage. If we determine that an unfavorable outcome of a particular matter is probable and can be estimated, we accrue the contingent obligation, as

 million and million, respectively, were reflected on our consolidated balance sheets related to contingent obligations that met both the probable and reasonably estimable criteria. In addition, we may recognize additional contingent losses in the future related to (i) contingent matters for which a loss is currently considered reasonably possible but not probable and/or (ii) losses in excess of amounts that have already been accrued for such contingent matters. In some of these cases, we are not able to estimate possible losses or a range of possible losses in excess of amounts accrued. For such matters where additional contingent losses can be reasonably estimated, the range of additional losses is estimated to be up to approximately million. 
 The outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty and there can be no assurance that the outcome of a particular matter will not result in the payment of amounts that have not been accrued for the matter. Furthermore, we may revise accrual amounts or our estimates of reasonably possible losses prior to resolution of a particular contingency based on changes in facts and circumstances or changes in the expected outcome. 
 The following sections include descriptions of certain matters that could impact the Partnership s financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows in future periods. The following sections also include updates to certain matters that have previously been disclosed, even if those matters are not anticipated to have a potentially significant impact on future periods. In addition to the matters disclosed in the following sections, the Partnership is also involved in multiple other matters that could impact future periods, including other lawsuits and arbitration related to the Partnership s commercial agreements. With respect to such matters, contingencies that met both the probable and reasonably estimable criteria have been included in the accruals disclosed above, and the range of additional losses disclosed above also reflects any relevant amounts for such matters. 
 Dakota Access Pipeline 
 On July 27, 2016, the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe SRST filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia District Court challenging permits issued by the United States Army Corps of Engineers USACE that allowed Dakota Access to cross the Missouri River at Lake Oahe in North Dakota. The case was subsequently amended to challenge an easement issued by the USACE that allowed the pipeline to cross land owned by the USACE adjacent to the Missouri River. Dakota Access and the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe CRST intervened. Separate lawsuits filed by the Oglala Sioux Tribe OST and the Yankton Sioux Tribe YST were consolidated with this action and several individual tribal members intervened (collectively, with SRST and CRST, the Tribes ). On March 25, 2020, the District Court remanded the case back to the USACE for preparation of an Environment Impact Statement EIS ). On July 6, 2020, the District Court vacated the easement and ordered the Dakota Access Pipeline to be shut down and emptied of oil by August 5, 2020. Dakota Access and the USACE appealed to the Court of Appeals which granted an administrative stay of the District Court s July 6 order and ordered further briefing on whether to fully stay the July 6 order. On August 5, 2020, the Court of Appeals (1) granted a stay of the portion of the District Court order that required Dakota Access to shut the pipeline down and empty it of oil, (2) denied a motion to stay the March 25 order pending a decision on the merits by the Court of Appeals as to whether the USACE would be required to prepare an EIS and (3) denied a motion to stay the District Court s order to vacate the easement during this appeal process. The August 5 order also states that the Court of Appeals expected the USACE to clarify its position with respect to whether USACE intended to allow the continued operation of the pipeline notwithstanding the vacatur of the easement and that the District Court may consider additional relief, if necessary. 
 On August 10, 2020, the District Court ordered the USACE to submit a status report by August 31, 2020, clarifying its position with regard to its decision-making process with respect to the continued operation of the pipeline. On August 31, 2020, the USACE submitted a status report that indicated that it considered the presence of the pipeline at the Lake Oahe crossing without an easement to constitute an encroachment on federal land, and that it was still considering whether to exercise its enforcement discretion regarding this encroachment. The Tribes subsequently filed a motion seeking an injunction to stop the operation of the pipeline and both USACE and Dakota Access filed briefs in opposition of the motion for injunction. The motion for injunction was fully briefed as of January 8, 2021. 
 On January 26, 2021, the Court of Appeals affirmed the District Court s March 25, 2020 order requiring an EIS and its July 6, 2020 order vacating the easement. In this same January 26 order, the Court of Appeals also overturned the District Court s July 6, 2020 order that the pipeline shut down and be emptied of oil. Dakota Access filed for rehearing en banc on April 12, 2021, which the Court of Appeals denied. On September 20, 2021, Dakota Access filed a petition with the U.S. Supreme Court to hear the case. Oppositions were filed by the Solicitor General (December 17, 2021) and the Tribes

 cases: one case initiated by the State of Maryland and one by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. The actions brought also named as defendants ETO, ETP Holdco Corporation and Sunoco Partners Marketing Terminals L.P., now known as Energy Transfer Marketing Terminals L.P. ETP Holdco Corporation and Energy Transfer Marketing Terminals L.P. are wholly owned subsidiaries of Energy Transfer. 
 It is reasonably possible that a loss may be realized in the remaining cases; however, we are unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss in excess of amounts accrued. An adverse determination with respect to one or more of the MTBE cases could have a significant impact on results of operations during the period in which any such adverse determination occurs, but such an adverse determination likely would not have a material adverse effect on the Partnership s consolidated financial position. 
 Rover State of Ohio 
 On November 3, 2017, the State of Ohio and the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency Ohio EPA filed suit against Rover and other defendants (collectively, the Defendants seeking to recover approximately million in civil penalties allegedly owed and certain injunctive relief related to permit compliance. The Defendants filed several motions to dismiss, which were granted on all counts. The Ohio EPA appealed, and on December 9, 2019, the Fifth District Court of Appeals entered a unanimous judgment affirming the trial court. The Ohio EPA sought review from the Ohio Supreme

 million for late payment interest for identified and unidentified royalty owners and interest-on-interest. This amount was later amended to million to account for interest accrued from trial (the Order ). Judge Gibney also awarded punitive damages in the amount of million. The Class is also seeking attorneys fees. 
 On August 27, 2020, ETMT filed its Notice of Appeal with the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals 10th Circuit and appealed the entirety of the Order. The matter was fully briefed, and oral argument was set for November 15, 2021. However, on November 1, 2021, the 10th Circuit dismissed the appeal due to jurisdictional concerns with finality of the Order. En banc rehearing of this decision was denied on November 29, 2021. On December 1, 2021, ETMT filed a Petition for Writ of Mandamus to the 10th Circuit to correct the jurisdictional problems and secure final judgment. On February 2, 2022, the 10th Circuit denied the Petition for Writ of Mandamus, citing that there are other avenues for ETMT to obtain adequate relief. On February 10, 2022, ETMT filed a Motion to Modify the Plan of Allocation Order and Issue a Rule 58 Judgment with the trial court, requesting the District Court to enter a final judgment in compliance with the Rules. ETMT also filed an injunction with the trial court to enjoin all efforts by plaintiffs to execute on any non-final judgment. On March 31, 2022, Judge Gibney denied the Motion to Modify the Plan of Allocation, reiterating his thoughts that the order constitutes a final judgment. Judge Gibney granted the injunction in part (placing a hold on enforcement efforts for 60 days) and denied the injunction in part. The injunction has since been lifted. 
 Despite the fact that ETMT has taken the position that the judgment is not final and not subject to execution, the Class engaged in asset discovery and actively tried to collect on the judgment through garnishment proceedings from ETMT s customers. ETMT unsuccessfully tried to deposit the funds into the District Court s Registry. Accordingly, to stop the garnishment proceedings, on December 2, 2022, ETMT wired approximately million to the Plaintiff s approved Plan Administrator, which represented at the time the full amount of the judgment with attorney s fees and post-judgment interest. ETMT did so without waiving its ability to pursue its pending appeal or its right to appeal the merits of the judgment. Plaintiff has since dismissed the garnishment actions. 
 ETMT cannot predict the outcome of the case, nor can ETMT predict the amount of time and expense that will be required to resolve the appeal. ETMT has been vigorous and diligent in its appeals relating to the finality issues underlying the Order and appealed the denial of the Motion to Modify to the 10th Circuit in an attempt to get a decision on finality. The appeal was fully briefed, and oral argument was held on March 21, 2023. On August 3, 2023, the 10th Circuit ruled in favor of ETMT and found that the district court s plan of allocation (which was part of the final judgment) did not satisfy all finality requirements. The Court held that the district court abused its discretion in denying ETMT s Rule 60(b)(6) Motion to Modify and reversed and remanded for further proceedings. The case was sent back to the trial court so that the district court could fix the finality requirements with the judgment. Further, ETMT sought and recovered a return of funds deposited with the Plan Administrator; Class Counsel did not oppose this motion.

 statutory rate from the date of the prior improper judgment up until October 17, 2023. However, the Judge tolled the running of interest for the time period during which the Plan Administrator was in possession of ETMT s funds (between November 2, 2022 and October 10, 2023). Based on this ruling, the Class calculated that approximately million in additional interest should be added to the final judgment. On October 19, 2023, the District Court entered the new final judgment with a corrected Plan of Allocation. Both parties agree that this newly entered judgment fixes the finality concerns and will allow an appeal to the 10th Circuit on the merits. With the inclusion of additional interest, the total amount awarded to the Plaintiffs is approximately million in actual damages and million in punitive damages. ETMT has appealed the entirety of the judgment to the Tenth Circuit. Oral argument will take place at the Tenth Circuit on November 20, 2024. 
 Energy Transfer LP and ETC Texas Pipeline, Ltd. v. Culberson Midstream LLC, et al. 
 On April 8, 2022, Energy Transfer and ETC Texas Pipeline, Ltd. ETC, and together with Energy Transfer, Plaintiffs filed suit against Culberson Midstream LLC Culberson ), Culberson Midstream Equity, LLC Culberson Equity ), and Moontower Resources Gathering, LLC Moontower ). On October 1, 2018, ETC and Culberson entered into a Gas Gathering and Processing Agreement (the Bypass GGPA under which Culberson was to gather gas from its dedicated acreage and deliver all committed gas exclusively to ETC. In connection with the Bypass GGPA, on October 18, 2018, Energy Transfer and Culberson Equity also entered into an Option Agreement. Under the Option Agreement, Culberson Equity and Moontower had the right (but not the obligation) to require Energy Transfer to purchase their respective interests in Culberson by way of a put option. Notably, the Option Agreement is only enforceable so long as the parties comply with the Bypass GGPA. In late March 2022, Culberson Equity and Moontower submitted a put notice to Energy Transfer seeking to require Energy Transfer to purchase their respective interests in Culberson for approximately million. On April 8, 2022, Plaintiffs filed suit against Culberson, Culberson Equity and Moontower asserting claims for declaratory judgment and breach of contract, contending that they materially breached the Bypass GGPA by sending some committed gas to third parties and also by failing to send any gas to Plaintiffs since March 2020, and thus that Culberson Equity s and Moontower s put notice is void. Culberson, Culberson Equity, and Moontower have answered the lawsuit. Additionally, Culberson filed a counterclaim against ETC for breach of the Bypass GGPA, seeking the recovery of damages and attorneys fees. Culberson Equity and Moontower also filed a counterclaim against Energy Transfer for (1) breach of the Option Agreement, and (2) a declaratory judgment concerning Energy Transfer s alleged obligation to purchase the Culberson interests. The lawsuit is pending in the 193rd Judicial District Court the Court in Dallas County, Texas. On April 27, 2022, Culberson filed an application for a temporary restraining order, temporary injunction, and permanent injunction, and Culberson Equity and Moontower joined in that request. The Court held a hearing on the application on April 28 and denied the injunction. In early May, Culberson filed a motion to enforce the appraisal process and confirm the validity of their put price calculation, to which Plaintiffs objected. On July 11, 2022, the Court held a hearing on the motion, and on July 19, 2022, the Court ordered the parties to engage in an appraisal process regarding the put price. An independent appraiser was appointed and issued his decision on October 15, 2022, concluding that the put price totals million. Plaintiffs have consistently reiterated their objection to the appraisal process and conclusion. 
 On October 6, 2022, Culberson, Culberson Equity and Moontower filed a motion for summary judgment, but the Court postponed considering it until after further document discovery and depositions. On December 7, 2022, Plaintiffs amended their petition to add Moontower Resources Operating, LLC and Moontower Resources WI, LLC as Defendants, and to assert a claim against all Defendants for fraudulent inducement. 
 Defendants refiled updated motions for summary judgment on May 5, 2023, seeking summary judgment on: (1) Plaintiffs breach of contract and declaratory judgment claims on a no-evidence basis; (2) Plaintiffs fraud and alter ego claims on a no-evidence basis; and (3) Plaintiffs fraud claim on a traditional basis. Plaintiffs responded on June 6, 2023. Defendants submitted their replies in support of summary judgment on June 12, 2023. 
 On June 5, 2023, counsel for Defendants informed the Court via a letter that Defendants were continuing the submission date of the no-evidence motion regarding Plaintiffs breach of contract and declaratory judgment claims, noting that such submission would be rescheduled along with a traditional summary judgment motion regarding the same subject matter. To that end, on July 17, 2023, Defendant Culberson Midstream, LLC filed a Traditional Motion for Summary Judgment on Plaintiffs Breach of Contract and Declaratory Judgment Claims, while Defendants Culberson Midstream Equity, LLC and Moontower Resources Gathering filed a Motion for Partial Summary Judgment Regarding the Breach of the Option Agreement. Further, on July 25, 2023, Defendants filed a Traditional and No-Evidence Motion for Summary Judgment Regarding Damages and Recission. On July 28, 2023, in turn, Plaintiff ETC Texas Pipeline, Ltd. filed a Traditional Motion for Partial Summary Judgment on Breach of Contract and Declaratory Judgment.

 million in legal fees associated with SUG environmental response activities. The MA AG requests that the DPU initiate an investigation into NEG s collection and reconciliation of recoverable environmental costs, namely: (1) the legal fees charged by the Kasowitz, Benson, Torres Friedman firm and passed through the recovery mechanism since 2005; (2) the legal fees charged by the Bishop, London Dodds firm and passed through the recovery mechanisms since 2005; and (3) the legal fees passed through the recovery mechanism that the MA AG contends only qualify for a lesser (i.e., 50 level of recovery. Respondents maintain that, by tariff, these costs are recoverable through rates charged to NEG customers pursuant to the environmental remediation adjustment clause program. After the Respondents answered the complaint and filed a motion to dismiss in 2011, the Hearing Officer deferred decision on the motion to dismiss and issued a stay of discovery pending resolution of a discovery dispute, which it later lifted on June 24, 2013, permitting the case to resume. However, the MA AG failed to take any further steps to prosecute its claims for nearly seven years. The case remained largely dormant until February 2022, when the Hearing Officer denied the motion to dismiss. After receiving input from the parties, the Hearing Officer entered a procedural schedule on March 16, 2022 (which was amended slightly on August 22, 2022). The parties engaged in discovery and the preparation of pre-filed testimony. Respondents submitted their pre-filed testimony on July 11, 2022. The MA AG served three sets of discovery requests on Respondents on September 9, September 12, and September 20, respectively, to which Respondents timely responded. On October 5, 2022, the MA AG requested that the DPU issue a ruling on whether the information that Respondents redacted in their attorneys fees invoices is protected by the attorney-client privilege. On the same day, the MA AG also filed a Motion to Stay the Procedural Schedule pending a ruling on the privilege issue. On October 6, 2022, without even affording Respondents the opportunity to respond, the DPU granted the MA AG s request to stay the procedural schedule. Accordingly, all previous deadlines (including the MA AG s October 7, 2022, deadline to submit direct pre-filed testimony) are presently stayed. On October 18, 2023, the DPU issued an Order on Attorney General s Motion to Compel, ruling on issues originally raised in a motion to compel that the MA AG filed in 2013. The October 18, 2023 Order directed NEG to review its redactions again and, to the extent any invoices are completely redacted or heavily redacted, to provide more lightly redacted versions within 30 days. The October 18, 2023 Order also stated that the DPU will set a new procedural schedule in this matter sometime after NEG complies with the directives in the order, which the Company has completed as of January 17, 2024. The matter remains stayed until the DPU sets a new procedural schedule.

 State of Oklahoma Attorney General Winter Storm Uri 
 On April 10, 2024, the State of Oklahoma, through Attorney General Gentner Drummond, filed a petition on behalf of Grand River Dam Authority against Defendants ET Gathering Processing, LLC, successor by merger to Enable Midstream Partners, LP, Enable Oklahoma Intrastate Transmission, LLC, Enable Gas Transmission, LLC and Enable Energy Resources, LLC arising out of Winter Storm Uri in February 2021. Specifically, plaintiff alleges that defendants violated the Oklahoma Antitrust Reform Act (79 O.S. 201, et. seq. by acting individually and in concert with each other to unreasonably restrain trade in the natural gas market in Oklahoma during the storm. Plaintiff also alleges causes of action for breach of contract, unjust enrichment, fraud, bad faith, conspiracy and negligence. Plaintiff s petition seeks actual damages, punitive damages, treble damages and attorney s fees and costs. However, the actual amount sought was not specified. 
 On June 3, 2024, defendants filed a Motion to Dismiss and, alternatively, a Motion to Transfer Venue, along with a Brief in Support. In its Motion to Dismiss, defendants argued that plaintiff s petition fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted and also that such claims should be dismissed because collateral estoppel bars plaintiff from bringing allegations inconsistent with earlier agency and judicial findings that the extreme cold weather not defendants conduct caused the natural gas shortage and resulting high prices during Winter Storm Uri. Defendants also argued that plaintiff s suit should be dismissed for filing suit in the wrong forum or, alternatively, should be transferred to the correct county of venue (Oklahoma County). Plaintiff filed its response brief on July 12, 2024. A hearing on both motions was held on October 15, 2024, and the parties are currently awaiting the Judge s ruling on the motions. 
 Defendants cannot predict the ultimate outcome of this litigation but will vigorously defend against these claims. 
 Tax Contingencies 
 Internal Revenue Service Audits 
 The Partnership s 2020 U.S. Federal income tax return is currently under examination by the Internal Revenue Service IRS ). In general, Energy Transfer and its subsidiaries are no longer subject to examination by the IRS, and most state tax authorities, for the 2019 and prior tax years. 
 USAC is currently under examination by the IRS for years 2019 and 2020. The IRS has issued preliminary partnership examination changes, along with imputed underpayment computations. Based on discussions with the IRS, USAC has estimated a potential range of loss up to million, including interest. Once a final partnership imputed underpayment, if any, is determined, USAC s general partner may either elect to pay the imputed underpayment (including any applicable penalties and interest) directly to the IRS or, if eligible, issue a revised information statement to each USAC unitholder, and former USAC unitholder, as applicable, with respect to an audited and adjusted return. 
 New York Motor Fuel Excise Tax Audits 
 ETMT, Sunoco LLC and Sunoco Retail LLC are currently under motor fuel excise tax audits in the state of New York for the periods of March 2017 through May 2020. These audits are currently ongoing and no assessments have been made. We cannot predict the outcome of these audits; however, to the extent material assessments may be issued, we would expect to use all appropriate administrative and legal measures to defend our positions.

 million, including penalties and interest. 
 Environmental Remediation 
 Our subsidiaries are responsible for environmental remediation at certain sites, including the following: 
 Certain of our interstate pipelines conduct soil and groundwater remediation related to contamination from past uses of polychlorinated biphenyls PCBs ). PCB assessments are ongoing and, in some cases, our subsidiaries could be contractually responsible for contamination caused by other parties. 
 Certain gathering and processing systems are responsible for soil and groundwater remediation related to releases of hydrocarbons. 
 Legacy sites related to Sunoco, Inc. that are subject to environmental assessments, including formerly owned terminals and other logistics assets, retail sites that the Partnership no longer operates, closed and/or sold refineries and other formerly owned sites. 
 The Partnership is potentially subject to joint and several liability for the costs of remediation at sites at which it has been identified as a potentially responsible party PRP ). As of September 30, 2024, the Partnership had been named as a PRP at approximately identified or potentially identifiable Superfund sites under federal and/or comparable state law. The Partnership is usually one of a number of companies identified as a PRP at a site. The Partnership has reviewed the nature and extent of its involvement at each site and other relevant circumstances and, based upon the Partnership s purported nexus to the sites, believes that its potential liability associated with such sites will not be significant.

 Non-current Total environmental liabilities 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Partnership recorded million and million, respectively, of expenditures related to environmental cleanup programs. 
 Our pipeline operations are subject to regulation by the United States Department of Transportation under PHMSA, pursuant to which PHMSA has established requirements relating to the design, installation, testing, construction, operation, replacement and management of pipeline facilities. Moreover, PHMSA, through the Office of Pipeline Safety, has promulgated a rule requiring pipeline operators to develop integrity management programs to comprehensively evaluate their pipelines, and take measures to protect pipeline segments located in what the rule refers to as high consequence areas. Activities under these integrity management programs involve the performance of internal pipeline inspections, pressure testing or other effective means to assess the integrity of these regulated pipeline segments, and the regulations require prompt action to address integrity issues raised by the assessment and analysis. Integrity testing and assessment of all of these assets will continue, and the results of such testing and assessment could cause us to incur future capital and operating expenditures for repairs or upgrades deemed necessary to ensure the continued safe and reliable operation of our pipelines; however, no estimate can be made at this time of the likely range of such expenditures. 
 Our operations are also subject to the requirements of the Federal Occupational Safety and Health Act OSHA and comparable state laws that regulate the protection of the health and safety of employees. In addition, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration s hazardous communication standard requires that information be maintained about hazardous materials used or produced in our operations and that this information be provided to employees, state and local government authorities and citizens. We believe that our past costs for OSHA required activities, including general industry standards, record keeping requirements and monitoring of occupational exposure to regulated substances have not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations; however, there is no assurance that such costs will not be material in the future.

 Regulatory Update 
 Interstate Natural Gas Transportation Regulation 
 Rate Regulation 
 Effective January 2018, the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act changed several provisions of the federal tax code, including a reduction in the maximum corporate tax rate. On March 15, 2018, in a set of related proposals, the FERC addressed treatment of federal income tax allowances in regulated entity rates. The FERC issued a Revised Policy Statement on Treatment of Income Taxes Revised Policy Statement stating that it will no longer permit master limited partnerships to recover an income tax allowance in their cost-of-service rates. The FERC issued the Revised Policy Statement in response to a remand from the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in United Airlines v. FERC, in which the court determined that the FERC had not justified its conclusion that a pipeline organized as a master limited partnership would not double recover its taxes under the current policy by both including an income-tax allowance in its cost of service and earning a return on equity calculated using the discounted cash flow methodology. On July 18, 2018, the FERC clarified that a pipeline organized as a master limited partnership will not be precluded in a future proceeding from arguing and providing evidentiary support that it is entitled to an income tax allowance and demonstrating that its recovery of an income tax allowance does not result in a double-recovery of investors income tax costs. On July 31, 2020, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit issued an opinion upholding the FERC s decision denying a separate master limited partnership recovery of an income tax allowance and its decision not to require the master limited partnership to refund accumulated deferred income tax balances. In light of the rehearing order s clarification regarding an individual entity s ability to argue in support of recovery of an income tax allowance and the court s subsequent opinion upholding denial of an income tax allowance to a master limited partnership, the impact of the FERC s policy on the treatment of income taxes on the rates we can charge for FERC-regulated transportation services is unknown at this time. 
 Even without application of the FERC s rate making-related policy statements and rulemakings, the FERC or our shippers may challenge the cost-of-service rates we charge. The FERC s establishment of a just and reasonable rate is based on many components, including ROE and tax-related components, but also other pipeline costs that will continue to affect FERC s determination of just and reasonable cost-of-service rates. Moreover, we receive revenues from our pipelines based on a variety 
 
 45 

Table of Contents 

 of rate structures, including cost-of-service rates, negotiated rates, discounted rates and market-based rates. Many of our interstate pipelines, such as Tiger Pipeline, Midcontinent Express Pipeline and Fayetteville Express Pipeline, have negotiated market rates that were agreed to by customers in connection with long-term contracts entered into to support the construction of the pipelines. Other systems, such as Florida Gas Transmission Pipeline, Transwestern and Panhandle, have a mix of tariff rate, discount rate and negotiated rate agreements. The revenues we receive from natural gas transportation services we provide pursuant to cost-of-service based rates may decrease in the future as a result of changes to FERC policies, combined with the reduced corporate federal income tax rate established in the Tax Act. The extent of any revenue reduction related to our cost-of-service rates, if any, will depend on a detailed review of all of our cost-of-service components and the outcomes of any challenges to our rates by the FERC or our shippers. 
 On July 18, 2018, the FERC issued a final rule establishing procedures to evaluate rates charged by the FERC-jurisdictional gas pipelines in light of the Tax Act and the FERC s Revised Policy Statement. By an order issued on January 16, 2019, the FERC initiated a review of Panhandle s then existing rates pursuant to Section 5 of the Natural Gas Act to determine whether the rates charged by Panhandle are just and reasonable and set the matter for hearing. On August 30, 2019, Panhandle filed a general rate proceeding under Section 4 of the Natural Gas Act. The Natural Gas Act Section 5 and Section 4 proceedings were consolidated by order of the Chief Judge on October 1, 2019. The initial decision by the administrative law judge was issued on March 26, 2021, and on December 16, 2022, the FERC issued its order on the initial decision. On January 17, 2023, Panhandle and the Michigan Public Service Commission each filed a request for rehearing of FERC s order on the initial decision, which were denied by operation of law as of February 17, 2023. On March 23, 2023, Panhandle appealed these orders to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit Court of Appeals ), and the Michigan Public Service Commission also subsequently appealed these orders. On April 25, 2023, the Court of Appeals consolidated Panhandle s and Michigan Public Service Commission s appeals and stayed the consolidated appeal proceeding while the FERC further considered the requests for rehearing of its December 16, 2022 order. On September 25, 2023, the FERC issued its order addressing arguments raised on rehearing and compliance, which denied our requests for rehearing. Panhandle filed its Petition for Review with the Court of Appeals regarding the September 25, 2023 order. On October 25, 2023, Panhandle filed a limited request for rehearing of the September 25 order addressing arguments raised on rehearing and compliance, which was subsequently denied by operation of law on November 27, 2023. On November 17, 2023, Panhandle provided refunds to shippers and on November 30, 2023, Panhandle submitted a refund report regarding the consolidated rate proceedings, which was protested by several parties. On January 5, 2024, the FERC issued a second order addressing arguments raised on rehearing in which it modified certain discussion from its September 25, 2023 order and sustained its prior conclusions. Panhandle has timely filed its Petition for Review with the Court of Appeals regarding the January 5, 2024 order. On May 28, 2024, the FERC issued an order rejecting Panhandle s refund report. On June 27, 2024, Panhandle filed a revised refund report in compliance with the FERC s May 28, 2024 order rejecting Panhandle s refund report, a request for rehearing of the FERC s May 28, 2024 order rejecting Panhandle s refund report, and provided revised refunds to shippers, or in the case of shippers whose revised refunds are less than the original amounts refunded, notices of upcoming debits. One party protested Panhandle s revised refund report, and Panhandle submitted a response to the protest on July 24, 2024. By notice issued July 29, 2024, Panhandle s rehearing request was deemed denied. In an ordered issued September 9, 2024, FERC addressed arguments raised on rehearing, modified the discussion in the May 28, 2024 order and continued to reach the same result. On September 18, 2024, Panhandle petitioned the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia for review of the September 9, 2024, July 29, 2024, and May 28, 2024 orders. 
 Pipeline Certification 
 The FERC issued a Notice of Inquiry on April 19, 2018 Pipeline Certification NOI ), thereby initiating a review of its policies on certification of natural gas pipelines, including an examination of its long-standing Policy Statement on Certification of New Interstate Natural Gas Pipeline Facilities, issued in 1999, that is used to determine whether to grant certificates for new pipeline projects. On February 18, 2021, the FERC issued another NOI 2021 NOI ), reopening its review of the 1999 Policy Statement. Comments on the 2021 NOI were due on May 26, 2021; we filed comments in the FERC proceeding. In September 2021, FERC issued a Notice of Technical Conference on Greenhouse Gas Mitigation related to natural gas infrastructure projects authorized under Sections 3 and 7 of the Natural Gas Act. A technical conference was held on November 19, 2021, and post-technical conference comments were submitted to the FERC on January 7, 2022. 
 On February 18, 2022, the FERC issued two new policy statements: (1) an Updated Policy Statement on the Certification of New Interstate Natural Gas Facilities and (2) a Policy Statement on the Consideration of Greenhouse Gas Emissions in Natural Gas Infrastructure Project Reviews 2022 Policy Statements ), to be effective that same day. On March 24, 2022, the FERC issued an order designating the 2022 Policy Statements as draft policy statements, and requested further comments. The FERC will not apply the now draft 2022 Policy Statements to pending applications or applications to be filed at FERC until it issues any final guidance on these topics. Comments on the 2022 Policy Statements were due on April 25, 2022, and reply comments were due on May 25, 2022. We are unable to predict what, if any, changes may be proposed as a result of the 2022 Policy Statements that might affect our natural gas pipeline or LNG facility projects, or when such new policies, if any, might become 
 
 46 

Table of Contents 

 effective. We do not expect that any change in these policy statements would affect us in a materially different manner than any other natural gas pipeline company operating in the United States. 
 Interstate Common Carrier Regulation 
 Liquids pipelines transporting in interstate commerce are regulated by FERC as common carriers under the Interstate Commerce Act ICA ). Under the ICA, the FERC utilizes an indexing rate methodology which, as currently in effect, allows common carriers to change their rates within prescribed ceiling levels that are tied to changes in the Producer Price Index for Finished Goods, or PPI-FG. Many existing pipelines utilize the FERC liquids index to change transportation rates annually. The indexing methodology is applicable to existing rates, with the exclusion of market-based rates. The FERC s indexing methodology is subject to review every five years. 
 On December 17, 2020, FERC issued an order establishing a new index of PPI-FG plus 0.78 . The FERC received requests for rehearing of its December 17, 2020 order and on January 20, 2022, granted rehearing and modified the oil index. Specifically, for the five-year period commencing July 1, 2021 and ending June 30, 2026, FERC-regulated liquids pipelines charging indexed rates are permitted to adjust their indexed ceilings annually by PPI-FG minus 0.21 . FERC directed liquids pipelines to recompute their ceiling levels for July 1, 2021 through June 30, 2022, as well as the ceiling levels for the period July 1, 2022 to June 30, 2023, based on the new index level. Where an oil pipeline s filed rates exceed its ceiling levels, FERC ordered such oil pipelines to reduce the rate to bring it into compliance with the recomputed ceiling level to be effective March 1, 2022. Some parties sought rehearing of the January 20 order with FERC, which was denied by FERC on May 6, 2022. Certain parties have appealed the January 20 and May 6 orders. Such appeals remain pending at the D.C. Circuit. 
 On October 20, 2022, the FERC issued a policy statement on the Standard Applied to Complaints Against Oil Pipeline Index Rate Changes to establish guidelines regarding how the FERC will evaluate shipper complaints against oil pipeline index rate increases. Specifically, the policy statement adopted the proposal in the FERC s earlier Notice of Inquiry issued on March 25, 2020 to eliminate the Substantially Exacerbate Test as the preliminary screen applied to complaints against index rate increases and instead adopt the proposal to apply the Percentage Comparison Test as the preliminary screen for both protests and complaints against index rate increases. At this time, we cannot determine the effect of a change in the FERC s preliminary screen for complaints against index rates changes, however, a revised screen would result in a threshold aligned with the existing threshold for protests against index rate increases. Any complaint or protest raised by a shipper could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 
 Air Quality Standards 
 In 2023, the United States Environmental Protection Agency EPA finalized its Good Neighbor Plan (the Plan which seeks to reduce nitrogen oxide pollution from power plants and other industrial facilities from 23 upwind states which the EPA determined is contributing to National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) nonattainment and interfering with maintenance of the 2015 ozone NAAQS in downwind states. As part of the Plan, the EPA announced that it would be issuing prescriptive emission standards for several sectors, including certain new and existing internal combustion engines of a certain size used in pipeline transportation of natural gas. The EPA s final rule was to become effective on August 4, 2023, and the prescribed emission standards were scheduled to be effective in 2026. 
 Operators and industry groups have challenged the Plan in the D.C. Circuit, as well as the legal predicates to the individual upwind states inclusion in the Plan in the regional circuits. The effectiveness of the rule is currently stayed in the nine states within the Partnership s footprint, either by nature of judicial stays of the legal predicate to the Plan or by judicial stay of the Plan itself by the U.S. Supreme Court. Proceedings as to both on the merits are ongoing. In the challenge to the Plan in the D.C. Circuit, oral argument is expected in early 2025 and a decision could take several months, projected late 2025. 
 The Partnership currently estimates that the final rule would require retrofitting or replacement of approximately 192 engines in its interstate and intrastate natural gas transportation and storage operations. The Partnership is involved in challenging application of the Plan in the nine states impacted within its footprint. Compliance with the Plan (if implementation is not stayed or otherwise delayed) will still require substantial capital expenditures which could adversely affect our business in future periods. However, at this time, we are still assessing the potential costs of this rule and, given uncertainties resulting from the multiple legal challenges filed against the Plan in various states, in the DC Circuit and the U.S. Supreme Court, we cannot predict with any certainty what the final costs of compliance for the Plan for the Partnership ultimately may be. 
 
 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 We report Segment Adjusted EBITDA and consolidated Adjusted EBITDA as measures of segment performance. We define Segment Adjusted EBITDA and consolidated Adjusted EBITDA as total partnership earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, depletion, amortization and other non-cash items, such as non-cash compensation expense, gains and losses on 
 
 47 

Table of Contents 

 disposals of assets, the allowance for equity funds used during construction, unrealized gains and losses on commodity risk management activities, inventory valuation adjustments, non-cash impairment charges, losses on extinguishments of debt and other non-operating income or expense items, as well as certain non-recurring gains and losses. Inventory valuation adjustments that are excluded from the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA represent only the changes in lower of cost or market reserves on inventory that is carried at LIFO. These amounts are unrealized valuation adjustments applied to Sunoco LP s fuel volumes remaining in inventory at the end of the period. 
 Segment Adjusted EBITDA and consolidated Adjusted EBITDA reflect amounts for unconsolidated affiliates based on the same recognition and measurement methods used to record equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates. Adjusted EBITDA related to unconsolidated affiliates excludes the same items with respect to the unconsolidated affiliate as those excluded from the calculation of Segment Adjusted EBITDA and consolidated Adjusted EBITDA, such as interest, taxes, depreciation, depletion, amortization and other non-cash items. Although these amounts are excluded from Adjusted EBITDA related to unconsolidated affiliates, such exclusion should not be understood to imply that we have control over the operations and resulting revenues and expenses of such affiliates. We do not control our unconsolidated affiliates; therefore, we do not control the earnings or cash flows of such affiliates. The use of Segment Adjusted EBITDA or Adjusted EBITDA related to unconsolidated affiliates as an analytical tool should be limited accordingly. 
 Segment Adjusted EBITDA, as reported for each segment in the following table, is analyzed for each segment in the section titled Segment Operating Results. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure used by industry analysts, investors, lenders and rating agencies to assess the financial performance and the operating results of the Partnership s fundamental business activities and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitution for net income, income from operations, cash flows from operating activities or other GAAP measures.

 Net Income. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period last year, net income increased 387 million, or approximately 37 , primarily due to the recognition of a 625 million non-operating litigation-related loss in the prior period. This impact was partially offset by an increase in interest expense, as well as changes in Segment Adjusted EBITDA, as discussed below. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period last year, net income increased 1.39 billion, or approximately 37 , primarily due to the recognition of a 598 million gain on Sunoco LP s sale of its West Texas assets in the current period, as well as the recognition of a 625 million non-operating litigation-related loss in the prior period. The change in net income also reflected higher segment margin from multiple segments, partially offset by increases in operating expenses, selling, general and administrative expenses, depreciation, depletion and amortization, impairment losses, interest expense and income tax expense; these changes are discussed in more detail below and in Segment Operating Results. 
 Adjusted EBITDA (consolidated). For the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period last year, Adjusted EBITDA increased primarily due to the impacts of recently acquired assets, as well as higher volumes in our midstream segment and higher pipeline optimization in our intrastate transportation and storage segment. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period last year, the increase in Adjusted EBITDA reflected higher earnings from multiple segments, primarily due to the impacts of recently acquired assets. 
 Additional discussion on the changes impacting net income and Adjusted EBITDA for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods last year is available below and in Segment Operating Results. 
 Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization. Depreciation, depletion and amortization increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods last year primarily due to additional depreciation and amortization from assets recently placed in service and recent acquisitions. 
 Interest Expense, Net of Interest Capitalized. Interest expense, net of interest capitalized, increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods last year primarily due to higher aggregate debt balances as a result of recent acquisitions and an increase in Sunoco LP s debt, including the impact of the NuStar acquisition, as well as higher interest rates on floating rate and recently refinanced debt.

 Income Tax Expense. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods last year, income tax expense increased due to the taxable gain recognized by a corporate subsidiary of Sunoco LP on its sale of West Texas assets. 
 Impairment Losses. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, impairment losses were related to Sunoco LP s termination of a lease in June 2024. For the three months ended September 30, 2023, impairment losses included a total of 1 million recognized by USAC related to its compression equipment. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, impairment losses included a total of 12 million recognized by USAC related to its compression equipment. 
 (Gain) loss on Interest Rate Derivatives. Gains and losses on interest rate derivatives resulted from changes in forward interest rates, which caused our forward-starting swaps to change in value. 
 Unrealized (Gain) Loss on Commodity Risk Management Activities. The unrealized gains and losses on our commodity risk management activities include changes in fair value of commodity derivatives and the hedged inventory included in designated fair value hedging relationships. Information on the unrealized gains and losses within each segment are included in Segment Operating Results, and additional information on the commodity-related derivatives, including notional volumes, maturities and fair values, is available in Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk and in Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 1. Financial Statements.

 Segment Operating Results 
 We evaluate segment performance based on Segment Adjusted EBITDA, which we believe is an important performance measure of the core profitability of our operations. This measure represents the basis of our internal financial reporting and is one of the performance measures used by senior management in deciding how to allocate capital resources among business segments. 
 The following tables identify the components of Segment Adjusted EBITDA, which is calculated as follows: 
 Segment margin, operating expenses and selling, general and administrative expenses . These amounts represent the amounts included in our consolidated financial statements that are attributable to each segment.

Table of Contents 

 Unrealized gains or losses on commodity risk management activities and inventory valuation adjustments . These are the unrealized amounts that are included in cost of products sold to calculate segment margin. These amounts are not included in Segment Adjusted EBITDA; therefore, the unrealized losses are added back and the unrealized gains are subtracted to calculate the segment measure. 
 Non-cash compensation expense . These amounts represent the total non-cash compensation recorded in operating expenses and selling, general and administrative expenses. This expense is not included in Segment Adjusted EBITDA and therefore is added back to calculate the segment measure. 
 Adjusted EBITDA related to unconsolidated affiliates . Adjusted EBITDA related to unconsolidated affiliates excludes the same items with respect to the unconsolidated affiliate as those excluded from the calculation of Segment Adjusted EBITDA, such as interest, taxes, depreciation, depletion, amortization and other non-cash items. Although these amounts are excluded from Adjusted EBITDA related to unconsolidated affiliates, such exclusion should not be understood to imply that we have control over the operations and resulting revenues and expenses of such affiliates. We do not control our unconsolidated affiliates; therefore, we do not control the earnings or cash flows of such affiliates. 
 The following analysis of segment operating results includes a measure of segment margin. Segment margin is a non-GAAP financial measure and is presented herein to assist in the analysis of segment operating results and particularly to facilitate an understanding of the impacts that changes in sales revenues have on the segment performance measure of Segment Adjusted EBITDA. Segment margin is similar to the GAAP measure of gross margin, except that segment margin excludes charges for depreciation, depletion and amortization. Among the GAAP measures reported by the Partnership, the most directly comparable measure to segment margin is Segment Adjusted EBITDA; a reconciliation of segment margin to Segment Adjusted EBITDA is included in the following tables for each segment where segment margin is presented. 
 In addition, for certain segments, the following sections include information on the components of segment margin by sales type, which components are included in order to provide additional disaggregated information to facilitate the analysis of segment margin and Segment Adjusted EBITDA. For example, these components include transportation margin, storage margin and other margin. These components of segment margin are calculated consistent with the calculation of segment margin; therefore, these components also exclude charges for depreciation, depletion and amortization.

 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 Overview 
 Our ability to satisfy obligations and pay distributions to unitholders will depend on our future performance, which will be subject to prevailing economic, financial, business and weather conditions, and other factors, many of which are beyond management s control.

Table of Contents 

 We currently expect capital expenditures in 2024 to be within the following ranges (including capitalized interest and overhead and only our proportionate share for joint ventures, but excluding capital expenditures related to our investments in Sunoco LP and USAC): 
 Growth Maintenance Low High Low High Intrastate transportation and storage 45 50 55 60 Interstate transportation and storage 160 170 190 195 Midstream 870 940 390 395 NGL and refined products transportation and services 1,215 1,290 130 135 Crude oil transportation and services 290 310 140 145 All other (including eliminations) 220 240 65 70 Total capital expenditures 
 2,800 3,000 970 1,000 
 The assets used in our natural gas and liquids operations, including pipelines, gathering systems and related facilities, are generally long-lived assets and do not require significant maintenance capital expenditures. Accordingly, we do not have any significant financial commitments for maintenance capital expenditures in our businesses. From time to time we experience increases in pipe costs due to a number of reasons, including but not limited to, delays from steel mills, limited selection of mills capable of producing large diameter pipe timely, higher steel prices and other factors beyond our control. However, we have included these factors in our anticipated growth capital expenditures for each year. 
 We generally fund capital expenditures and distributions with cash flows from operating activities. 
 Sunoco LP currently expects to spend approximately 120 million in maintenance capital expenditures and at least 300 million in growth capital for the full year 2024. 
 USAC currently plans to spend between 27 million and 30 million in maintenance capital expenditures and between 240 million and 250 million in expansion capital expenditures for the full year 2024. 
 Cash Flows 
 Our cash flows may change in the future due to a number of factors, some of which we cannot control. These include regulatory changes, the price for our products and services, the demand for such products and services, margin requirements resulting from significant changes in commodity prices, operational risks, the successful integration of our acquisitions and other factors. 
 Operating Activities 
 Changes in cash flows from operating activities between periods primarily result from changes in earnings (as discussed in Results of Operations ), excluding the impacts of non-cash items and changes in operating assets and liabilities. Non-cash items include recurring non-cash expenses, such as depreciation, depletion and amortization expense and non-cash compensation expense. The increase in depreciation, depletion and amortization expense during the periods presented primarily resulted from construction and acquisition of assets, while changes in non-cash compensation expense resulted from changes in the number of units granted and changes in the grant date fair value estimated for such grants. Cash flows from operating activities also differ from earnings as a result of non-cash charges that may not be recurring, such as impairment charges and allowance for equity funds used during construction. The allowance for equity funds used during construction increases in periods when we have a significant amount of interstate pipeline construction in progress. Changes in operating assets and liabilities between periods result from factors such as the changes in the value of price risk management assets and liabilities, the timing of accounts receivable collection, the timing of payments on accounts payable, the timing of purchase and sales of inventories and the timing of advances and deposits received from customers. 
 Nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to nine months ended September 30, 2023 . Cash provided by operating activities during 2024 was 8.92 billion compared to 8.26 billion for 2023, and net income was 5.12 billion for 2024 and 3.73 billion for 2023. The difference between net income and net cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily consisted of net changes in operating assets and liabilities (net of effects of acquisitions and divestitures) of 190 million and other items totaling 3.39 billion, which includes non-cash items and items related to investing and financing activities that are included in net income. 
 The non-cash activity in 2024 and 2023 consisted primarily of depreciation, depletion and amortization of 3.79 billion and 3.23 billion, respectively, non-cash compensation expense of 113 million and 99 million, respectively, unfavorable

 inventory valuation adjustments of 99 million and favorable inventory adjustments of 113 million, respectively, and deferred income taxes of 165 million and 187 million, respectively. Net income also included equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates of 285 million and 286 million for 2024 and 2023, respectively, as well as a 598 million gain on Sunoco LP s sale of its West Texas assets in 2024. 
 Cash provided by operating activities includes cash distributions received from unconsolidated affiliates that are deemed to be paid from cumulative earnings, which distributions were 263 million in 2024 and 286 million in 2023. 
 Cash paid for interest, net of interest capitalized, was 1.84 billion and 1.54 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Interest capitalized was 77 million and 53 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 Investing Activities 
 Cash flows from investing activities primarily consist of cash amounts paid for acquisitions, capital expenditures, cash contributions to our joint ventures and cash proceeds from sales or contributions of assets or businesses. In addition, distributions from equity investees are included in cash flows from investing activities if the distributions are deemed to be a return of the Partnership s investment. Changes in capital expenditures between periods primarily result from increases or decreases in our growth capital expenditures to fund our construction and expansion projects. 
 Nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to nine months ended September 30, 2023. Cash used in investing activities during 2024 was 4.44 billion compared to 3.36 billion for 2023. Total capital expenditures (excluding the allowance for equity funds used during construction and net of contributions in aid of construction costs) for 2024 were 2.64 billion compared to 2.39 billion for 2023. Additional detail related to our capital expenditures is provided in the table below. 
 In 2024, we paid 2.17 billion, net of cash received, for the WTG Midstream acquisition, we paid 84 million to acquire the outstanding noncontrolling interest in Edwards Lime Gathering, LLC, which is now a wholly owned subsidiary, and we also paid 219 million for other acquisitions. In 2024, Sunoco LP paid 209 million in cash for acquisitions of terminals and received 27 million in cash from the NuStar acquisition. Additionally, in 2024, Sunoco LP received cash proceeds of 990 million from its sale of West Texas assets. In 2023, we paid 930 million in cash for the Lotus Midstream acquisition and Sunoco LP paid 111 million in cash for the acquisition of terminals. 
 In 2024 and 2023, we received cash distributions from unconsolidated affiliates in excess of cumulative earnings of 60 million and 45 million, respectively, and we paid contributions to unconsolidated affiliates of 205 million and 5 million in cash, respectively. 
 The following is a summary of capital expenditures (including only our proportionate share for joint ventures, net of contributions in aid of construction costs) on an accrual basis for the nine months ended September 30, 2024:

 Financing Activities 
 Changes in cash flows from financing activities between periods primarily result from changes in the levels of borrowings and equity issuances, which are primarily used to fund our acquisitions and growth capital expenditures. Distributions increase between the periods based on increases in the number of common units outstanding or increases in the distribution rate. 
 Nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to nine months ended September 30, 2023. Cash used in financing activities during 2024 was 4.34 billion compared to 4.64 billion for 2023. During 2024, we had a net increase in our debt

Our quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk are consistent with those discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Since December 31, 2023, there have been no material changes to our primary market risk exposures or how those exposures are managed. 
 Commodity Price Risk 
 The following table summarizes our commodity-related financial derivative instruments and fair values, including derivatives related to our consolidated subsidiaries, as well as the effect of an assumed hypothetical 10 change in the underlying price of the commodity. Dollar amounts are presented in millions.

 The fair values of the commodity-related financial positions have been determined using independent third-party prices, readily available market information and appropriate valuation techniques. Non-trading positions offset physical exposures to the cash market; none of these offsetting physical exposures are included in the above tables. Price-risk sensitivities were calculated by assuming a theoretical 10 change (increase or decrease) in price regardless of term or historical relationships between the contractual price of the instruments and the underlying commodity price. Results are presented in absolute terms and represent a potential gain or loss in net income or in other comprehensive income. In the event of an actual 10 change in prompt month natural gas prices, the fair value of our total derivative portfolio may not change by 10 due to factors such as when the

 financial instrument settles and the location to which the financial instrument is tied (i.e., basis swaps) and the relationship between prompt month and forward months. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 As of September 30, 2024, we and our subsidiaries had 3.09 billion of floating rate debt outstanding. A hypothetical change of 100 basis points would result in a maximum potential change to interest expense of 31 million annually. However, our actual change in interest expense may be less in a given period due to interest rate floors included in our variable rate debt instruments. We manage a portion of our interest rate exposure by utilizing interest rate swaps, including forward-starting interest rate swaps to lock-in the rate on a portion of anticipated debt issuances. 
 The following table summarizes USAC s interest rate swap which is no longer outstanding as of September 30, 2024, and which was not designated as a hedge for accounting purposes:

 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 We have established disclosure controls and procedures to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us, including our consolidated entities, in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. 
 Under the supervision and with the participation of senior management, including the Co-Chief Executive Officers (Co-Principal Executive Officers) and the Chief Financial Officer (Principal Financial Officer) of our General Partner, we evaluated our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined under Rule 13a 15(e) promulgated under the Exchange Act. Based on this evaluation, the Co-Principal Executive Officers and the Principal Financial Officer of our General Partner concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024 to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act (1) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and (2) is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Co-Principal Executive Officers and Principal Financial Officer of our General Partner, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13(a)-15(f) or Rule 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) during the three months ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 PART II OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
 For information regarding legal proceedings, see our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on February 16, 2024 and Note 10 in Item 1. Financial Statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2024. 
 Additionally, we have received notices of violations and potential fines under various federal, state and local provisions relating to the discharge of materials into the environment or protection of the environment. While we believe that even if any one or more of the following environmental proceedings were decided against us, it would not be material to our financial position, results of operations or cash flows, we are required to report governmental proceedings if we reasonably believe that such proceedings could result in monetary sanctions in excess of 0.3 million. 
 In January 2019, we received notice from the United States Department of Justice DOJ on behalf of the United States Environmental Protection Agency EPA that a civil penalty enforcement action was being pursued under the Clean Water Act for an estimated 450 barrel crude oil release from the Mid Valley Pipeline operated by SPLP and owned by Mid Valley Pipeline Company LLC MVPL ). The release purportedly occurred in October 2014 on a nature preserve located in Hamilton County, Ohio, near Cincinnati, Ohio. After discovery and notification of the release, SPLP conducted substantial emergency response, remedial work and primary restoration in three phases and the primary restoration has been acknowledged to be complete. In December of 2019, SPLP reached an agreement in principal with the USEPA regarding payment of a civil penalty. In September of 2024, after a public comment period, the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio (Western Division) entered a Consent Decree whereby SPLP and MVPL fully resolved both the civil penalty and alleged natural resource damages (NRD) which had been brought jointly by the DOJ, on behalf of trustees of the United States, and the Ohio Attorney General, on behalf of the trustees of the State of Ohio. Payments of approximately 565,000 for the civil penalty plus interest and approximately 1.9 million for natural resource damages, reimbursement and interest will be made within 30 days. Operation and maintenance activities associated with the restoration are expected to continue for several years. 
 On June 26, 2023, Plaintiffs Michael and Cecilia Weinman ("Plaintiffs") filed suit in Chester County, Tennessee, against MVPL and other Energy Transfer defendants asserting claims for negligence, trespass, and other tort claims and alleging damage to their property stemming from the crude oil release. Plaintiffs alleged actual monetary damages and punitive damages totaling 380 million. The Energy Transfer defendants were served on or around July 5, 2023, and timely filed a notice of removal of the lawsuit to federal court in the Western District of Tennessee Eastern Division on August 2, 2023. On August 8, 2023, plaintiffs filed a notice of voluntary dismissal of their lawsuit without prejudice. On or about August 7, 2024, plaintiffs refiled their suit with slight modifications and removing their negligence per se claim in Chester County, Tennessee. On or about August 27, 2024, the first two Energy Transfer defendants were served. On or about September 13, 2024, plaintiffs filed a notice of voluntary dismissal of their latest lawsuit without prejudice. 
 On June 15, 2023, PHMSA issued a Notice of Probable Violation, Proposed Civil Penalty, and Proposed Compliance Order (collectively NOPV ), CPF 4-2023-011-NOPV, identifying three probable violations with compliance order actions associated with two of them and civil penalties proposed in an amount totaling 2,473,912. The NOPV related to a PHMSA Accident Investigation Division investigation of a pigging incident which occurred on March 26, 2020 at the Partnership s Borcher Station in Kansas and resulted in a fatality. The Partnership challenged PHMSA s alleged violations and related civil penalties and compliance order actions contained in the NOPV. After an administrative hearing, which was held on April 24, 2024 before a PHMSA Presiding Official, the PHMSA Southwest Region recommended to remain relatively firm on the NOPV, with only a slightly reduced civil penalty of approximately 2.5 million. The Partnership is challenging this recommendation and filed its response on July 31, 2024. 
 Pursuant to the instructions to Form 10-Q, matters disclosed in this Part II - Item 1 include any reportable legal proceeding (i) that has been terminated during the period covered by this report, (ii) that became a reportable event during the period covered by this report, or (iii) for which there has been a material development during the period covered by this report. 
 For additional information required in this Item, see disclosure under the headings Litigation and Contingencies and Environmental Matters in Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements in Item 1. Financial Statements, which information is incorporated by reference into this Item. 
 
 ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS
