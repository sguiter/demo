Earnings Per Share 
 
 Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net earnings by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. The weighted average number of common shares outstanding does not include any potentially dilutive securities or any unvested restricted shares of common stock. These unvested restricted shares, although classified as issued and outstanding, are considered forfeitable until the restrictions lapse and will not be included in the basic EPS calculation until the shares are vested. Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing net earnings by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period plus the number of shares of common stock that would be issued assuming all contingently issuable shares having a dilutive effect on the earnings per share were outstanding for the period. The dilutive effect of unvested restrictive stock is determined using the treasury stock method. However, if the assumed common shares are anti-dilutive, basic and diluted earnings per share are the same.)

 The effective tax rate for the three - and nine -month periods ended September 30, 2024 is 0 , compared to an effective tax rate of and for the three - and nine -month periods ended September 30, 2023 , respectively. The difference between the statutory rate of and the effective tax rate expense of for the three - and nine -month periods ended September 30, 2024 is due to the valuation allowance recorded against the deferred tax assets (net) as of September 30, 2024 . 

and proceeds were received during the second quarter. The claim liability of approximately included in accrued liabilities as of June 30, 2024, was paid to the customer in July 2024, and the claim was settled. 
 
 On December 21, 2021, the Company's former Chief Executive Officer ("Former CEO") delivered his Notice of Termination and alleged that the Company breached the terms of the Employment Agreement between the Company and the Former CEO by, among others, placing the Former CEO on paid administrative leave in June 2021 pending an internal investigation. On December 22, 2021, the Board of Directors accepted the Former CEO's resignation from the Company but rejected his request to treat his resignation as resignation for good reason under Paragraph 10 of his Employment Agreement. The Board also determined, based on the findings of its investigation, that the Former CEO committed willful malfeasance in violation of his Employment Agreement, and that such willful malfeasance would have justified termination of employment pursuant to Paragraph 9 of the Employment Agreement, but for his earlier resignation. The Former CEO claims that he is entitled to a severance payment equal to times his average annual compensation as set forth in the Employment Agreement, plus the reimbursement of certain expenses and the value of any lost benefits. In September 2024, mediation efforts between the Company and the Former CEO resulted in a good-faith agreement in principle for settlement of the dispute between the two parties, which is expected to be executed prior to the end of 2024. The agreement is anticipated to settle all matters previously noted for approximately . The settlement agreement does not impact the post-retirement benefits under the employment agreement. As it is probable that a liability will be realizable and the settlement is estimable, a contingent liability of has been recorded with respect to this matter as of September 30, 2024. This legal settlement cost is reflected as a separate component of operating costs for the three - and nine -month periods ended September 30, 2024. 

On June 7, 2021, a Summons and Complaint was filed by an employee in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of Erie, against Servotronics, Inc., the Servotronics Board of Directors, The Ontario Knife Company and Kenneth D. Trbovich (collectively, the Defendants ). The Complaint alleges certain violations under the New York Human Rights Law by the Defendants relating to the employee s employment by the Company as well as intentional and negligent infliction of emotional distress. The Complaint also alleges certain purported derivative causes of action against all Defendants, including breach of fiduciary duties, fraud and corporate waste. The Complaint seeks monetary damages in an amount not less than with respect to the direct causes of action and equitable relief with respect to the purported derivative causes of action. The Defendants filed a motion to dismiss the Complaint on August 6, 2021. On January 13, 2022, the Defendants' motion to dismiss was granted, in part, and denied, in part. The Company is insured for such matters in the amount of million with a retention of for defense costs. During 2023, the Company met the retention amount, so defense costs are covered by insurance. Additionally, there is an excess coverage policy for million that considers the retention payment from the primary insurance policy as the excess million retention. Based on the information known by the Company as of the date of this filing, the Company does not consider the risk of loss to be probable and is unable to reasonably or accurately estimate the likelihood and amount of any liability that may be realized as a result of this litigation. Accordingly, loss has been recognized in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements related to this litigation. The Company is vigorously defending against this litigation. 
 
 There are no other legal proceedings currently pending by or against the Company other than litigation incidental to the business which is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the business or earnings of the Company. 

of revenue for both the three - and nine -month periods ended September 30, 2024 compared to and for the three - and nine -month periods ended September 30, 2023 , respectively. While the Company continues to pursue diversification of its customer base, the loss of, or significant reduction in business from, any of these major customers could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. The Company routinely assesses its relationships with major customers, including creditworthiness, market conditions, and competitive pressures, to mitigate risks associated with customer concentration. Despite these efforts, there can be no assurance that the Company will successfully reduce its dependence on any single customer in the future. 
 
 The Company relies on a variety of suppliers for the procurement of raw materials, components, and services necessary for its operations. While the Company actively manages its relationships with suppliers and seeks to diversify its supplier base, a disruption in the supply of goods or services from a major supplier could have a material adverse effect on the Company's operations and financial results. To mitigate the risks associated with supplier concentration, the Company engages in ongoing efforts to identify alternative sources of supply, assess supplier reliability and performance, and negotiate favorable contractual terms where feasible. However, there can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in reducing its dependence on any single supplier or mitigating the impact of supplier-related risks in the future. During the three - and nine -month periods ended September 30, 2024 , there were no purchases for products derived from one supplier greater than 10 of total vendor purchases compared to and from one supplier for the three - and nine -month periods ended September 30, 2023 , respectively. 

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview 
 
 The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our condensed consolidated financial statements and the related notes appearing elsewhere in this report. 
 
 The discussion and analysis contain forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties, and assumptions. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements due to many known and unknown risks and uncertainties described elsewhere in this report. 
 
 Business Overview Environment 
 
 We are a strategic partner in the aerospace industry, playing a key role in supporting the growth of commercial airplanes, including narrow body and widebody aircraft and business jets. We have long-term customer contracts resulting from being a trusted partner in safety-critical, high-temperature, and high-vibration environments. Our servo-control components and advanced technology products are sold to commercial aerospace, government, medical, and industrial markets. Through strong industry partnerships, innovative product offerings, and a commitment to excellence, we aim to maintain our leadership position and capitalize on emerging opportunities in the dynamic commercial aerospace landscape, as well as the other markets. 
 
 As disclosed in Note 1 of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, we divested the OKC operations and exited the CPG business segment during 2023. This divestiture represented a strategic shift, and we realigned our corporate and management reporting structure to focus solely on servo-control components and other advanced technology products as a single reportable segment. This segment structure reflects the financial information and reports used by our Management team, specifically the Chief Executive Officer. Therefore, the management discussion and analysis below pertain only to the results of operations of our continuing operations, unless otherwise noted. 
 
 Commercial Aerospace Market 
 
 The commercial aerospace market, characterized by its dynamic nature, is witnessing unprecedented growth driven by increased global travel demands. We are deeply involved in providing cutting-edge solutions and components to meet the evolving needs of aerospace manufacturers and operators worldwide. Our strategic focus within this market encompasses developing and supplying advanced materials, components, and systems that enhance aircraft performance, efficiency, and safety. The commercial aerospace industry s ability to meet the significant travel demand is currently hindered by supply chain issues as well as ongoing challenges with supply of parts and people constraints. We have been, and continue to be, challenged by these same factors, as noted in our Management Summary.

Revenue 
 
 Revenue for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 increased by approximately 848,000, or 7.3 , compared to the same period in 2023. This was driven by an increase in volume of approximately 467,000 and price increases of approximately 401,000, partially offset by unfavorable product mix of approximately (20,000). Our foreign sales were approximately 3,209,000 for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 compared to 3,652,000 for the same period in 2023, a decrease of approximately (443,000), or (12.1) . 
 
 Revenue for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 increased by approximately 3,858,000, or 12.3 , compared to the same period in 2023. This was driven by an increase in volume of approximately 2,980,000 and price increases of approximately 1,019,000, partially offset by unfavorable product mix of approximately (140,000). Our foreign sales were 8,968,000 for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 compared to 8,763,000 for the same period in 2023, a growth of approximately 205,000, or 2.3 . 
 
 The significant revenue growth over prior year is reflective of our successful focus on supporting our strong customer demand, notwithstanding reforecasting challenges that began during the third quarter of 2024 and are expected to continue through the remainder of the year. Our lower foreign sales for the quarter were a function of sales mix, however, our foreign sales for the year to date continue to constitute a substantial part of our overall revenue stream and can be attributed to the amplified demand for our products/services. 
 
 Gross Profit/Margin 
 
 Gross profit decreased approximately 231,000, or 9.2 , for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the same period in 2023resulting in a gross margin of 18.2 in the 2024 period, compared to a margin of 21.6 for the same period in 2023. 
 
 Gross profit increased approximately 2,027,000, or 40.2 , for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the same period in 2023, resulting in a gross margin of 20.1 in the 2024 period, compared to a margin of 16.1 for the same period in 2023. 
 
 The gross profit and gross margin for the quarter were negatively impacted by unfavorable product mix and higher overhead costs due to fewer research development (R D) project costs when compared to the prior year. These were partially offset by product liability costs recorded for a specific customer claim in the prior year. The improvements in gross profit and gross margin for the year were positively impacted by price increases, higher production volumes, and improved labor utilization, when compared to prior year. These improvements were partially offset by unfavorable product mix and overhead costs resulting from lower R D project costs in the current year. 
 
 Selling, General and Administrative ("SG A") 
 
 SG A expenses for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 of approximately 1,979,000 decreased 240,000, or 10.8 , when compared to 2,219,000 during the same period in 2023. SG A expenses as a percentage of revenue are 15.9 for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 compared to 19.2 for the same period in 2023. 
 
 SG A expenses for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 of approximately 6,394,000 decreased 1,269,000, or 16.6 , when compared to 7,663,000 during the same period in 2023. SG A expenses as a percentage of revenue are 18.2 for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 compared to 24.5 for the same period in 2023. 
 
 The SG A expense decrease for the quarter is attributable to lower R D project costs and higher legal costs when compared to the prior year. The improvement in SG A expense for the year is also driven by lower R D project costs and professional and legal costs due to the significant, non-recurring bank refinancing, proxy contest and corporate restructuring charges in the prior year. The SG A expense as a percentage of revenue in the current year is more aligned with our expectations of standard business operations and cost containment efforts when compared to the prior year. 
 
 Legal Settlement 
 
 Legal settlement expense was approximately 570,000 the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 compared to 0 during the same period in 2023and is attributable to the expected settlement agreement related to employment contract disputes with a former officer of the Company prior to the end of year. As this expense is nonroutine in nature, it is shown as a separate component of operating costs in the current year. 
 
 Operating (Loss) Income 
 
 Operating loss of approximately (281,000) for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 declined by approximately (561,000) when compared to operating income of 280,000 during the same period in 2023. 
 
 Operating income of approximately 102,000 for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 improved by approximately 2,726,000 when compared to the operating loss of (2,624,000) during the same period in 2023. 
 
 The operating loss for the quarter was driven by the legal settlement costs, combined with unfavorable product mix and higher manufacturing costs. This was partially offset by lower SG A expense in the current year and product liability costs incurred in the prior year. The significant improvement in operating income for the year when compared to the prior year is due to double-digit revenue and gross profit growth, gross margin improvement driven by higher production output and utilization, and lower operating costs. 
 
 Other Expense 
 
 For the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, other expense increased by approximately 74,000, or 75.5 , compared to the same period in 2023. 
 
 For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, other expense increased by approximately 114,000, or 47.7 , compared to the same period in 2023. 
 
 The increase in interest and other expense the quarter was driven primarily by the annual facility fee for our asset-based line of credit that did not occur in the prior year. The increase for the nine months was due to the annual facility fee incurred in the quarter and higher interest rates in the current year when compared to the prior year.

(Loss) Income from Continuing Operations before Income Taxes 
 
 For the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, loss before income taxes was (453,000), a decrease of approximately (635,000), or (348.9) , compared to income before income taxes of 182,000 during the same period in 2023. 
 
 For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, loss before income taxes was (251,000), an increase of approximately 2,612,000, or 91.2 , compared to a loss before income taxes of (2,863,000) during the same period in 2023. 
 
 The loss before taxes for the quarter was due to the operating loss and higher interest and other expense, as noted above. The significant improvement in loss before taxes was due to the operating income for the year, as noted above. 
 
 Income Taxes 
 
 No tax expense was recorded in the quarter for the current and prior year, as the tax benefit related to the pretax loss is considered a deferred tax asset, and a full valuation allowance has been established against deferred tax assets. Consistent with the current quarter, no tax expense was recorded for the current year, however, tax expense of approximately 1,063,000 was recorded in the prior year due to the recording of the valuation allowance, as noted. 
 
 The Company s effective tax rate was 0.0 for the three-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The Company s effective tax rate was 0.0 and (10.4 for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The difference between the effective tax rates and the statutory rate of 21.0 in the current and prior year reflects the impact of a full valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets. See also Note 8, Income Taxes, of the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, for information concerning income taxes. 
 
 Loss (Income) from Continuing Operations net of Tax 
 
 Loss from continuing operations of (453,000) for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 declined by approximately (635,000) when compared to income from continuing operations of 182,000 for the same period in 2023 due to the reasons noted above. 
 
 Loss from continuing operations of (251,000) for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 improved by approximately 3,675,000 when compared to the loss from continuing operations of (3,926,000) for the same period in 2023 due to the reasons noted above. 
 
 Loss from Discontinued Operation 
 
 Loss from discontinued operation, net of tax, of (43,000) for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 improved by approximately 343,000 when compared to the loss from discontinued operation of (386,000) for the same period in 2023, as wind-down costs associated with the OKC operations and divestiture costs related to the CPG business segment are substantially complete when compared to the prior quarter. 
 
 Loss from discontinued operation, net of tax, of (72,000) for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 improved by approximately 7,254,000 when compared to the loss from discontinued operation of (7,326,000) for the same period in 2023, as wind-down costs associated with the OKC operations and divestiture costs related to the CPG business segment are substantially complete when compared to the prior year.

Operating Activities: 
 
 Cash provided by operating activities of 11,000 for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 represents an increase in cash flow from operations of 4,919,000 when compared to the cash use of (4,908,000) during the same period in 2023. The source of cash in the current year is due primarily to the increase in accounts payable offset by an increase in inventories to support higher production output. The use of cash in the prior year was due primarily to significant operating losses and an increase in accounts receivable. 
 
 We had working capital of approximately 21,845,000 and 20,795,000 as of September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively, of which approximately 196,000 and 308,000 as of September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively, was comprised of cash and restricted cash. The increase in working capital is due primarily to higher inventory levels to support our production output and revenue growth. 
 
 Investing Activities: 
 
 We used approximately (933,000) for investing activities during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, and used approximately (606,000) during the same period in 2023. The investing activities were used for capital expenditures (machinery and equipment and building improvements). 
 
 Financing Activities: 
 
 Cash provided by financing activities of 1,045,000 was driven primarily by advances from our line of credit (net of payments) of approximately 1,066,000 during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024. Our primary source of cash of approximately 1,663,000 for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023 was due to advances from our line of credit (net of payments) of approximately 2,164,000, partially offset by the payment of our equipment loans of approximately (501,000).

Table of Contents 

Discontinued Operation Activities: 
 
 Our use of cash from discontinued operating activities of approximately (172,000) during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 resulted from operating losses, wind-down and divestiture costs, which are substantially complete. For the same period in 2023, our source of cash of approximately 347,000 resulted from the proceeds from the sale of OKC assets, mostly offset by operating losses, wind-down and divestiture costs. 
 
 Ongoing Liquidity Considerations: 
 
 The significant improvement in operating results compared to prior year and the availability of funding from our credit facility provides us with adequate working capital and sufficient liquidity to fund our operations in the near term. We understand, however, that our ability to maintain sufficient liquidity is highly dependent upon achieving our expected operating results. Failure to achieve our expected operating results could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and our ability to obtain financing to support operations. 
 
 Management Summary 
 
 We are pleased with our revenue growth of 7 despite the challenges we are facing as a supplier for the commercial aerospace market, which is experiencing unprecedented headwinds in 2024. The aerospace industry has been rapidly ramping up over the last two years creating volatility in the market, including supply chain disruptions, demand and forecasting changes, and labor shortages and strikes. We are not immune to this volatility and the significant impact that the large aerospace manufacturers have on their supply chain. That said, our significant customers are reforecasting their demand for the remainder of the year and 2025. We are actively navigating through the complexity of aligning our customers reforecasts with our production output to achieve profitability. 
 
 We will continue to effectively manage costs and focus on operating cash flow, which reinforces our commitment to achieving profitability and enhancing shareholder value.
