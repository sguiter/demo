The term loan facility proceeds were used to (i) refinance a portion of existing indebtedness and terminate all commitments under the Company s prior million credit agreement and (ii) pay the fees, costs and expenses associated with the foregoing and the negotiation, execution and delivery of the Prior Credit Agreement. On December 21, 2021, the Company amended and restated the Prior Credit Agreement by entering into a million amended and restated credit agreement (the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement).

The dividend of million was paid on October 11, 2024. The Board of Directors currently intends to continue paying quarterly dividends. However, the Company s future dividend policy is subject to the Company s compliance with applicable laws, and depends on, among other things, the Company s results of operations, financial condition, level of indebtedness, capital requirements, contractual restrictions, restrictions in the Company s debt agreements, and other factors that the Board of Directors may deem relevant. Dividend payments are not mandatory or guaranteed and no assurance is made that the Company will continue to pay a dividend in the future.

period from the date of grant and typically have a term of years. Time-based restricted stock units granted to employees generally vest over a or period from the date of grant and are subject to continued employment with the Company. Performance-based restricted stock units generally vest over a performance cycle, which includes the year of the grant, and are based upon the Company s achievement of specified performance metrics. Awards under the 2019 Plan to non-employee directors have historically been in the form of restricted stock units, which vest annually starting on the grant date. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had million common shares available for issuance under the 2019 Plan. All share-based payments to employees of the Company, including grants of employee stock options (last awarded in 2015), are recognized in the consolidated financial statements based on their grant date fair values. The total compensation costs recognized for stock-based awards were million and million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , respectively. The total compensation costs recognized for stock-based awards were million and million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively . The future tax benefit of these stock-based awards as of the grant date was million and million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , respectively. The future tax benefit of these stock-based awards as of the grant date was million and million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The fair value of stock option grants is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The fair values of restricted stock units and performance-based restricted stock units are determined based on the closing market price of the Company s common stock on the date of grant. For performance-based restricted stock units, compensation cost is calculated taking into consideration the probability that the underlying performance goals will be achieved, which is monitored by management throughout the requisite service period. When it becomes probable, based on management s expectation of the Company s performance during the measurement period, that more or less than the previous estimate of the awarded shares will vest, an adjustment to compensation cost is recognized as a change in accounting estimate in the period the change is determined.

 The total cash received by the Company as a result of stock option exercises for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was million and million, respectively. The actual tax benefit realized as a result of stock option exercises and the vesting of other share-based awards for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were million and million, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , the total intrinsic value of stock options exercised were million and million, respectively. For performance-based restricted stock units granted during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the number of performance-based restricted stock units that will ultimately be earned will not be determined until the end of the respective performance periods, and may vary from as low as zero to as high as 2.5 times the target number depending on the level of achievement of certain performance goals. The level of achievement of these goals is based upon the financial results of the Company for the last full calendar year within the performance period. The performance goals consist of certain levels of achievement using the following financial metrics: revenue, operating income margin, and return on invested capital. If the performance goals are not met based on the Company s financial results, the applicable performance-based restricted stock units will not vest and will be forfeited. Shares subject to forfeited performance-based restricted stock units will be available for re-issuance under the Company s 2019 Plan.

million. The Company intends to pay this liability over the remaining one-year payment period as prescribed by the U.S. Tax Reform and regulatory guidance issued by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). As of September 30, 2024, the Company expects to pay the remaining liability of million in 2025. The remaining balance of the transition tax liability is recorded in income tax payable on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had approximately million in cumulative undistributed foreign earnings of its foreign subsidiaries. These earnings are not subject to U.S. federal income tax if distributed to the Company. The Company changed its assertion during 2018 on its foreign subsidiaries earnings that are permanently reinvested. A certain amount of earnings from specific foreign subsidiaries are permanently reinvested, and certain foreign earnings from other specific foreign subsidiaries are considered to be non-permanently reinvested and are available for immediate distribution to the Company. Income taxes have been accrued on the non-permanently reinvested foreign earnings, including the 2017 transition tax, the U.S. tax on GILTI and any applicable foreign or local withholding taxes. The Company estimates that it has approximately million of unrecognized deferred tax liabilities related to any remaining undistributed permanently reinvested foreign earnings that have not already been subject to the 2017 transition tax, the U.S. tax on GILTI, and any applicable foreign income tax or local withholding tax on cash distributions. The Company has been granted certain tax incentives, including tax holidays, for its subsidiaries in Thailand, China and Malaysia that expire at various dates, unless extended or otherwise renegotiated and are subject to certain conditions with which the Company expects to comply. The tax incentives in Thailand will expire on . The tax incentives in China expired on and the tax incentives in Malaysia expired on . The Company applied for a continuation of the Malaysia tax holiday, which will extend the tax incentive period for five to if approved. The Company applied for a China tax holiday in 2024 which will extend the tax incentive period by three years from 2024 to if approved. There is no guarantee of being awarded these tax incentives in the future. The net impact of these tax incentives was to lower foreign income tax expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 by approximately million (approximately per diluted share) and million (approximately per diluted share), respectively.

Total tax incentives 

As of September 30, 2024, the total amount of the Company s reserve for uncertain tax benefits, including interest and penalties, was million. The reserve is classified as long-term based on the Company s expectation of when the items will be settled. If the reserve for uncertain tax benefits was recognized, the effect would be million. The Company records interest expense and penalties accrued in relation to uncertain income tax benefits as a component of current income tax expense on the condensed consolidated statements of income.

Forward Currency Exchange Contracts The Company utilizes forward currency exchange contracts to manage its foreign currency exposure. The Company enters into forward currency exchange contracts for its operations in Mexico, Europe and Asia. These instruments are designated as cash flow hedges and the changes in fair value of the derivatives are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss on the consolidated balance sheet until earnings are affected by the variability of the cash flows. The fair value estimates for the Company s forward currency exchange contracts are based on Level 2 inputs of the fair value hierarchy, which includes obtaining directly or indirectly observable values from third parties active in the relevant markets. Inputs in the fair value of the foreign currency forward contracts include prevailing forward and spot prices for currencies.

million million net of tax) and an unrealized loss of million million net of tax), respectively, on its forward currency exchange contracts in other comprehensive income (loss) and transferred unrealized losses of million and unrealized gains of million, respectively, to cost of sales. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company recorded an unrealized gain of million million net of tax) and an unrealized gain of million million net of tax), respectively, on its forward currency exchange contracts in other comprehensive income (loss) and transferred unrealized gains of million and million, respectively, to cost of sales. The Company also has forward currency exchange contracts that have not been designated as accounting hedges and, therefore, changes in fair value are recorded in other (expense) income, net in the consolidated statements of income. Interest Rate Swap Agreement The Company utilizes an interest rate swap agreement to hedge a portion of its interest rate exposure on outstanding borrowings under the Credit Agreement. Under the interest rate swap agreement, the Company receives variable rate interest payments based on the one-month SOFR rate and pays fixed rate interest payments. The effect of the swap is to convert a portion of the floating rate interest expense to fixed interest rate expense. Based on the terms of the interest rate swap contract and the underlying borrowings outstanding under the Credit Agreement, the interest rate swap was determined to be highly effective, and thus qualifies and has been designated as a cash flow hedge. As such, changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss on the consolidated balance sheet until earnings are affected by the variability of cash flows. The fair value estimates for the Company s respective interest rate swap agreements were based on Level 2 inputs of the fair value hierarchy, as the Company obtains the valuation from a third party active in relevant markets. The valuation of the interest rate swap agreements is primarily measured through various pricing models and discounted cash flow analysis that incorporate observable market parameters, such as interest rate yield curves and volatility. The Company entered into an interest rate swap agreement on July 20, 2023 and the fixed interest rate for the contract is . As of September 30, 2024, the notional amount of this interest rate swap was million. The Company s previous interest rate swap agreement matured on July 20, 2023. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded an unrealized loss of million million net of tax) and an unrealized loss of million million net of tax), respectively, on the interest rate swap in other comprehensive income (loss). During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company recorded an unrealized loss of million million net of tax) and an unrealized loss of million million net of tax), respectively, on the interest rate swap in other comprehensive income (loss).

 OVERVIEW 
 Benchmark Electronics, Inc. (the Company) is a Texas corporation that provides advanced manufacturing services (electronic manufacturing services (EMS) and precision technology (PT) services), which includes design and engineering services and technology solutions. From initial product concept to volume production, including direct order fulfillment and aftermarket services, we are a trusted integrated services partner to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). Served markets include: semiconductor capital equipment (semi-cap), complex industrials, medical technologies, commercial aerospace and defense (A D), and advanced computing and communications (AC C). The Company has manufacturing operations located in the United States and Mexico (the Americas), Asia and Europe. 
 Our customer engagement focuses on three principal areas: 
 Manufacturing Services , which include printed circuit board assemblies (PCBAs) using both traditional surface mount technologies and microelectronics, subsystem assembly, system build and integration. System builds and integration often involve building a finished assembly that includes PCBAs, complex subsystem assemblies, mechatronics, displays, mechanicals, and other components. These final products may be configured to order and delivered directly to the end customer across all the industries we serve. Manufacturing services also includes precision technology services comprised of precision machining, advanced metal joining and welding, cleaning, assembly and functional testing primarily for the semi-cap (serving semi-cap customers) and A D markets. 

Design Engineering Services , which include design for manufacturability, design optimization for our factory processes and supply chain, and test development, concurrent and sustaining engineering, turnkey product design and regulatory services. Our engineering services may be for systems, sub-systems, printed circuit boards and assemblies, and components. We have the flexibility and capability to engage anywhere in the customer s design process flow. We provide these services across all the industries we serve. 

22 

Technology Solutions , which involve developing a library of building blocks or reference designs primarily in defense solutions, surveillance systems, millimeter wave radio frequency (RF) subsystems, and front-end managed connected data collection systems. We often partner with our customers to merge these solutions utilizing our engineering services to provide turnkey product development from requirements through the launch to volume production into our factories. Our building blocks can be utilized across a variety of industries, but we have significant focus and capabilities in the A D, medical, AC C, and the complex industrials markets. We have also developed differentiated capabilities in RF. The need to improve size, weight, and power to accommodate high frequency electronics communications is important to customers in the A D, medical, and AC C markets. 

Our core strength lies in our ability to partner with our customers to provide concept-to-production solutions through a tightly integrated and seamless set of design, test, manufacturing, supply chain, and support services. The integration of these product realization services, along with our global manufacturing presence, increases our ability to respond to our customers needs by providing accelerated time-to-market and time-to-volume production of high-quality products with an emphasis on complex products serving regulated markets with higher reliability requirements. These capabilities and attributes enable us to build strong strategic relationships with our customers while becoming an integral part of their business. 
 We believe our primary source of differentiation and value-add rests with our ability to engage with our customers at any point, from product development through volume production. This is enabled by our highly skilled personnel s ability to provide leading-edge technical capabilities in engineering services (including full lifecycle), high frequency RF solutions, microelectronics, miniaturization, and manufacturing services (including electronics and complex precision machining). These capabilities are brought to bear across diversified commercial end-markets, many of which are government regulated. To support customers across these sectors, we have strategically invested in geographically diverse manufacturing locations and global supply chain efficiencies. 
 In addition, we believe that a strong focus on human capital through the talent we hire and retain is critical to maintaining our competitiveness. Our people-first culture is centered on our five core values, consisting of acting with integrity, valuing inclusion, commitment to customers, promoting ingenuity, and genuine caring for each other, our customers and our communities, and we take pride in our innovative and continuous improvement mindset. We desire to delight our customers and deliver operational and financial performance aligned with our goals. Through our employee engagement and customer satisfaction feedback processes, we continuously solicit and act upon information to improve our company and better support our customers and business processes. We have invested in attracting and developing leadership throughout the organization and are committed to diversity and inclusion in our efforts to develop an innovative and forward-thinking workforce. 
 Our customers often face challenges in designing supply chains, demand planning, procuring materials and managing their inventories efficiently due to fluctuations in their customer demand, product design changes, short product life cycles and component price fluctuations. 
 We employ enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems and lean manufacturing principles to manage procurement and manufacturing processes in an efficient and cost-effective manner so that, where possible, components arrive on a just-in-time, as-and-when-needed basis. Because we are a significant purchaser of electronic components and other raw materials, we are generally able to capitalize on the economies of scale associated with our relationships with suppliers to negotiate price discounts, obtain components and other raw materials that are in short supply, and return excess components. Utilizing our agility and expertise in supply chain management and our relationships with suppliers across the supply chain, we strive to help reduce our customers cost of goods sold and inventory exposure. 
 We recognize manufacturing services revenue as the customer takes control of the manufactured products built to customer specifications. We also generate revenue from our design, development and engineering services, in addition to the sale of other inventory. 
 Revenue is measured based on the consideration specified in a contract with a customer. Under the majority of our manufacturing contracts with customers, the customer controls all of the work-in-progress as products are being built. Revenues under these contracts are recognized progressively based on the cost-to-cost method. For other manufacturing contracts, the customer does not take control of the product until it is completed. Under these contracts, we recognize revenue upon transfer of control of the product to the customer, which is generally when the goods are shipped. Revenue from design, development and engineering services is recognized over time as the services are performed. As a general matter, we assume no significant obligations after shipment as we typically warrant workmanship only. Therefore, the warranty provisions are generally not significant.

Third Quarter of 2024 Highlights 
 Sales for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were 657.7 million, a 9 decrease from sales of 719.7 million during the three months ended September 30, 2023. During the third quarter of 2024, sales to customers in our various industry sectors varied from the third quarter of 2023 as follows: 
 
 	 Semi-Cap increased by 13 , 
 	 Complex Industrials decreased by 2 , 
 	 Medical decreased by 28 , 
 	 A D increased by 2 , and 
 	A C C decreased by 27 
 The overall revenue decrease was primarily due to lower Medical and AC C revenue, due to general end demand softness. This was partially offset by an increase in Semi-Cap revenue, due to improving demand and new customer wins. See Results of Operations Sales discussion below. 
 Our sales depend on the success of our customers, some of which operate in businesses associated with rapid technological change and consequent product obsolescence. Developments adverse to our major customers or their products, the availability of electronic component supply, or the failure of a major customer to pay for components or services have adversely affected us by not allowing us to fulfill our total customer demand. A substantial percentage of our sales are made to a small number of customers, and the loss of a major customer, if not replaced, would adversely affect us. Sales to our ten largest customers represented 52 of our total sales during both the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. After a period of unprecedented global labor and supply disruptions, we have seen a general easing of certain material constraints across commodity categories, with the exception of older technologies where semiconductor original equipment manufacturers are not adding incremental capacity. The lack of capacity regarding these older technologies could constrain our ability to produce the full demand forecasts we are receiving from customers needing those parts. We have experienced a significant reduction of non-cancellable and non-returnable business terms from our suppliers as lead times have improved significantly from previous highs. 
 
 We experience fluctuations in gross profit from period to period. Different programs contribute different gross profits depending on the type of services involved, location of production, size of the program, complexity of the product and level of material costs associated with the various products. Moreover, new programs can contribute relatively less to our gross profit in their early stages when manufacturing volumes are usually lower, resulting in inefficiencies and unabsorbed manufacturing overhead costs. During periods of low production volume, we generally have unabsorbed manufacturing overhead costs and reduced gross profit. Gross profit can also be impacted by higher costs associated with other situations, such as supply chain constraints. In addition, a number of our new program ramps require incremental investment during the launch and ramp phase, which can exert downward pressure on our gross profit. 
 We have undertaken initiatives to restructure our business operations with the intention of improving utilization and reducing costs. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized 5.6 million of restructuring charges and other costs due to capacity and workforce reductions primarily at our sites in the Americas. See Results of Operations Restructuring Charges and Other Costs . 
 Inflation, interest rates, disruption in the global economy and financial markets, and geopolitical events continue to create uncertainty. However, we are not aware of any specific event or circumstance that would require updates to our estimates or judgments or require us to revise the carrying values of our assets or liabilities as of the date we filed this Report. These estimates may change as new events occur and additional information is obtained. Actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.

Americas. Third quarter of 2024 income from operations decreased 66 to 6.2 million from 18.3 million in the third quarter of 2023. Income from operations during the first nine months of 2024 decreased 31 to 31.4 million from 45.5 million in the same period of 2023. The decreases were primarily due to lower revenue partially offset by cost control. 
 Asia. Third quarter of 2024 income from operations decreased to 37.3 million from 37.5 million in the third quarter of 2023. The decrease was primarily due to lower margin mix on program sales. Income from operations during the first nine months of 2024 increased 12 to 103.3 million from 91.9 million in the same period of 2023. The increase was primarily due to cost control partially offset by lower revenue. 
 Europe. Third quarter of 2024 income from operations increased 70 to 6.7 million from 3.9 million in the third quarter of 2023. Income from operations during the first nine months of 2024 increased 44 to 20.1 million from 14.0 million in the same period of 2023. The increases were primarily due to higher revenue and cost control. 
 
 Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 
 SG A expenses increased to 36.6 million in the third quarter of 2024 from 35.5 million in the third quarter of 2023. SG A increased to 112.0 million in the first nine months of 2024 from 111.4 million in the same period of 2023. The increases were primarily due to higher legal and salary costs. 
 
 Amortization of Intangible Assets 
 Amortization of intangible assets was 1.2 million in the third quarter of 2024 and 1.6 million in the third quarter of 2023. Amortization of intangible assets was 3.6 million in the first nine months of 2024 and 4.8 million in the same period of 2023. The decreases were primarily due to certain intangible assets becoming fully amortized in 2023. 
 
 Restructuring Charges and Other Costs 
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized 0.8 million and 5.6 million, respectively, of restructuring charges and other costs primarily due to capacity and workforce reductions at our sites in the Americas. 
 
 During the third quarter and first nine months of 2023, we recognized 1.4 million and 5.2 million of restructuring charges, respectively, primarily due to expenses associated with announced site closures or exits, reductions in work force and other restructuring activities primarily in the Americas. Additionally, during the second quarter of 2023, the Company made the decision to no longer continue certain manufacturing capabilities in the Americas. In connection with that decision, the Company assessed the facility and equipment assets used in those manufacturing capabilities using valuation information from third parties and recorded 1.1 million of impairment charges as a result of that assessment during the first nine months of 2023. The asset impairment charges are included in the restructuring charges and other costs line item on the condensed consolidated statements of income. 
 See Note 12 to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Report for additional information on our restructuring charges and other costs. 
 
 27 

Interest Expense 
 Interest expense decreased to 6.6 million in the third quarter of 2024 from 8.5 million in the third quarter of 2023. Interest expense decreased to 20.7 million in the first nine months of 2024 from 23.2 million in the same period of 2023. The decreases were primarily due to decreased borrowings partially offset by a higher interest rate environment. 
 
 Interest Income 
 Interest income increased to 2.8 million in the third quarter of 2024 from 1.3 million in the third quarter of 2023. Interest income increased to 7.3 million in the first nine months of 2024 from 4.2 million in the same period of 2023. The increases were primarily due to higher interest rates and higher cash balances. 
 
 Other (Expense) Income, Net 
 Other (expense) income, net was an expense of 4.0 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to income of 2.4 million in the third quarter of 2023. Other (expense) income, net was an expense of 7.5 million in the first nine months of 2024 compared to an income of 0.3 million in the same period of 2023. The changes were primarily due to higher foreign currency exchange losses. 
 
 Income Tax Expense 
 Income tax expense of 5.0 million represented a 24.6 effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2024, compared with 5.2 million in the third quarter of 2023, representing an effective tax rate of 20.2 . Income tax expense of 15.1 million represented a 25.2 effective tax rate for the first nine months of 2024, compared with 12.1 million in the same period of 2023, representing an effective tax rate of 20.6 . The increase in 2024 is due to the expiration of tax incentives in China, the impact of the global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI) tax in the United States, and the implementation of the Global Minimum Tax (GMT) in some of our foreign jurisdictions beginning in 2024. 
 The Company has been granted certain tax incentives, including tax holidays, for its subsidiaries in Thailand, China and Malaysia that expire at various dates, unless extended or otherwise renegotiated, and are subject to certain conditions with which the Company expects to comply. The tax incentives in Thailand will expire on December 31, 2030. The tax incentives in China expired on December 31, 2023 and the tax incentives in Malaysia expired on March 31, 2021. The Company applied for a continuation of the Malaysia tax incentives, which will extend the tax incentive period for five to ten years if approved. The Company has also applied for a three year China tax incentive in 2024 that will provide tax incentives for three years from 2024 to 2026 if approved. There is no guarantee of being awarded these tax incentives in the future. See Note 8 to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Report. 
 
 Net Income 
 We reported net income of 15.4 million, or 0.42 per diluted share, for the third quarter of 2024, compared with net income of 20.4 million, or 0.57 per diluted share, for the third quarter of 2023. We reported net income of 44.9 million, or 1.23 per diluted share, for the first nine months of 2024, compared with net income of 46.8 million, or 1.30 per diluted share, for the first nine months of 2023. The increases were primarily due to the items discussed above. 
 
 28 

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 We have historically financed our organic growth and operations through funds generated from operations and occasional borrowings under our Credit Agreement (as defined below). Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash totaled 324.4 million as of September 30, 2024, which included 318.6 million held outside the United States in various foreign subsidiaries. 
 Our operations, and the operations of businesses we acquire, are subject to certain foreign, federal, state and local regulatory requirements relating to environmental, waste management, health and safety matters. We believe we operate in substantial compliance with all applicable requirements, and we seek to ensure that newly acquired businesses comply or will comply substantially with applicable requirements. To date, the costs of compliance and workplace and environmental remediation have not been material to us. However, material costs and liabilities may arise from these requirements or from new, modified or more stringent requirements in the future. In addition, our past, current and future operations, and the operations of businesses we have or may acquire, may give rise to claims of exposure by employees or the public, or to other claims or liabilities relating to environmental, waste management or health and safety concerns. 
 Management believes that our existing cash balances, funds generated from operations, and borrowing availability under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to permit us to meet our liquidity requirements over the next 12 months. Management further believes that our ongoing cash flows from operations and any borrowings we may incur under our revolving credit facility will enable us to meet operating cash requirements in future years. If we consummated significant acquisitions in the future, our capital needs would increase and could possibly result in our need to increase available borrowings under our Credit Agreement or access public or private debt and equity markets. There can be no assurance, however, that we would be successful in raising additional debt or equity on acceptable terms. 
 
 Cash Flows 
 Cash provided from operating activities was 143.3 million during the first nine months of 2024 and primarily consisted of 44.9 million of net income, adjusted for 34.6 million of depreciation and amortization, 10.7 million of stock-based compensation expense, a 76.5 million decrease in accounts receivable and a 102.5 million decrease in inventories, partially offset by a 59.5 million decrease in advance payments from customers, a 28.1 million decrease in accrued liabilities and a 16.1 million decrease in accounts payable. Working capital was 0.9 billion as of September 30, 2024. 
 We primarily purchase components only after customer orders or forecasts are received, which mitigates, but does not eliminate, the risk of loss on inventories. Supplies of electronic components and other materials used in operations are subject to industry-wide shortages. In certain instances, suppliers may allocate available quantities to us. When shortages of these components and other material supplies used in operations have occurred, vendors have at times been unable to ship the quantities we need for production, forcing us to delay shipments, which can increase backorders and impact cash flows. Vendors also may increase the costs of components based on the market conditions including these shortages. In certain instances, we request and receive advance payments from customers as prepayments of inventory to meet working capital demands of a contract, offset inventory risks such as inventory purchased in advance of current needs and protect the Company from the failure of other parties to fulfill obligations under a contract. For example, we have been impacted by supply chain constraints, including shortages, longer lead times and increased transit times. 
 Cash used in investing activities was 23.7 million during the first nine months of 2024 primarily due to capital expenditures for property, plant and equipment of 22.6 million and purchased software of 1.7 million. The purchases of property, plant and equipment were primarily for leasehold improvements and machinery and equipment in the Americas and Asia. 
 Cash used in financing activities was 81.2 million during the first nine months of 2024. Borrowings under the Credit Agreement were 455.0 million and principal payments under the Credit Agreement were 507.5 million. In addition, we paid 17.8 million of dividends, 6.2 million for employee taxes paid to settle stock-based awards exercised and 5.1 million of stock repurchases during the first nine months of 2024. 
 
 Credit Agreement 
 On December 21, 2021, the Company amended and restated the Company s prior 650 million credit agreement by entering into a 381 million amended and restated credit agreement (the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement). Under the terms of the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, in addition to the 131.3 million term loan facility, we have a 250.0 million five-year revolving credit facility to be used for general corporate purposes, both with a maturity date of December 21, 2026. 
 29 

On May 20, 2022, the Company entered into Amendment No. 1 (the Amendment) to the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (as amended, the Credit Agreement). The Amendment increased the revolving credit facility commitments from 250 million to 450 million. The Amendment also established that the interest on outstanding borrowings starting on the next reset date and any new borrowings under the Amendment (other than swingline loans) will accrue, at the Company s option, at (a) Bloomberg Short Term Bank Yield Index (BSBY) plus the Applicable Rate (as defined in the Credit Agreement, approximately 1.00 to 2.00 per annum depending on various factors) or (b) for U.S. dollar denominated loans, the base rate (which is the highest of (i) the federal funds rate plus 0.50 , (ii) the Bank of America, N.A. prime rate, (iii) the one-month BSBY adjusted daily rate plus 1.00 and (iv) 1.00 ). 
 On February 3, 2023, the Company entered into Amendment No. 2 to the Credit Agreement, which increased the maximum amount of trade accounts receivable that the Company may elect to sell at any one time to 200.0 million. 
 On May 1, 2023, the Company entered into Amendment No. 3 to the Credit Agreement (Amendment No. 3), which increased the revolving credit facility commitments from 450 million to 550 million. Amendment No. 3 also established that the interest on outstanding borrowings starting on the next reset date and any new borrowings under Amendment No. 3 (other than swingline loans) will accrue, at the Company s option, at (a) Term Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) plus 0.10 plus the Applicable Rate (as defined in the Credit Agreement, approximately 1.00 to 2.00 per annum depending on various factors) or (b) for U.S. dollar denominated loans, the base rate (which is the highest of (i) the federal funds rate plus 0.50 , (ii) the Bank of America, N.A. prime rate, (iii) Term SOFR plus 1.00 and (iv) 1.00 ). 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 124.7 million in borrowings outstanding under the term loan facility and 155.0 million outstanding under our revolving credit facility and 4.4 million in letters of credit outstanding under our revolving credit facility. See Note 5 to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Report for more information regarding the terms of our Credit Agreement. 
 The Credit Agreement contains certain financial covenants related to interest coverage and debt leverage, and certain customary affirmative and negative covenants, including restrictions on our ability to incur additional debt and liens, pay dividends, repurchase shares, sell assets and merge or consolidate with other persons. Amounts due under the Credit Agreement could be accelerated upon specified events of default, including a failure to pay amounts due, breach of a covenant, material inaccuracy of a representation, or occurrence of bankruptcy or insolvency, subject, in some cases, to cure periods. As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with all of these covenants and restrictions. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 390.6 million available for borrowings under the Credit Agreement, subject to compliance with financial covenants as to interest coverage and debt leverage, in addition to other debt covenant restrictions. During the next 12 months, we believe our capital expenditures will approximate 60 million to 70 million, principally for machinery and equipment to help increase our production capacity to support anticipated revenue growth and our ongoing business around the globe. 
 
 Dividends 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, cash dividends paid totaled 17.8 million and 17.6 million, respectively. On September 9, 2024, the Company declared a quarterly cash dividend of 0.17 per share of the Company s common stock to shareholders of record as of September 30, 2024. The dividend of 6.1 million was paid on October 11, 2024. 
 The Board of Directors currently intends to continue paying quarterly dividends. However, the Company s future dividend policy is subject to the Company s compliance with applicable law, and depending on, among other things, the Company s results of operations, financial condition, level of indebtedness, capital requirements, contractual restrictions, restrictions in the Company s debt agreements, and other factors that the Board of Directors may deem relevant. Dividend payments are not mandatory or guaranteed; there can be no assurance that the Company will continue to pay a dividend in the future. 
 
 Share Repurchase Authorization 
 On March 6, 2018, the Board of Directors approved an expanded share repurchase authorization granting the Company authority to repurchase up to 250 million in common stock in addition to the 100 million previously approved on December 7, 2015. On October 26, 2018 and February 19, 2020, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of an additional 100 million and 150 million of the Company s common stock, respectively. 
 Share purchases may be made in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions or block transactions, at the discretion of the Company s management and as market conditions warrant. Purchases will be funded from available cash and may be commenced, suspended or discontinued at any time without prior notice. Shares repurchased under the program are retired. 
 30 

The Company repurchased 0.1 million shares for an aggregate of 5.1 million at an average price of 40.27 per share during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 . As of September 30, 2024, the Company had 149.5 million remaining under share repurchase authorizations. 
 
 CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS 
 
 We have certain contractual obligations for operating leases that were summarized in Contractual Obligations under Part II, Item 7 in our 2023 10-K. Other than items discussed in Note 5 and Note 6 to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Report, there have been no material changes to our contractual obligations, outside of the ordinary course of our business, since December 31, 2023. 
 
 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES AND RECENTLY ENACTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES 
 
 Management s discussion and analysis is based upon our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. See Note 2 to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Report for a discussion of recently enacted accounting principles. Also, our significant accounting policies are summarized in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in our 2023 10-K. There have been no changes to the items disclosed as critical accounting estimates in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Part II, Item 7 of our 2023 10-K. 
 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitat ive Disclosures About Market Risk 
 Our international sales comprise a significant portion of our business. We are exposed to risks associated with operating internationally, including: 
 Foreign currency exchange risk; 

Import and export duties, taxes and regulatory changes; 

Inflationary economies or currencies; and 

Economic and political instability. 

Additionally, some of our operations are in developing countries. Certain events, including natural disasters, can impact the infrastructure of a developing country more severely than they would impact the infrastructure of a developed country. A developing country can also take longer to recover from such events, which could lead to delays in our ability to resume full operations. 
 We transact business in various foreign countries and are subject to foreign currency fluctuation risks. We use natural hedging and forward contracts to economically hedge transactional exposure primarily associated with trade accounts receivable, other receivables and trade accounts payable that are denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the respective operating entity. We do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes. Certain forward currency exchange contracts in place as of September 30, 2024 have not been designated as accounting hedges and, therefore, changes in fair value are recorded within our unaudited condensed consolidated statements of income in Part I, Item 1 of this Report. 
 The Company enters into forward currency exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges of forecasted foreign currency expenses. Changes in the fair value of the derivatives are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss on the condensed consolidated balance sheets until earnings are affected by the variability of the cash flows. 
 Our sales are substantially denominated in U.S. dollars. Our foreign currency cash flows are generated in certain European and Asian countries and Mexico. 
 We are also exposed to market risk for changes in interest rates on our financial instruments, a portion of which relates to our invested cash balances. We do not use derivative financial instruments in our investing activities. We place cash and cash equivalents and investments with various major financial institutions. We protect our invested principal funds by limiting default risk, market risk and reinvestment risk. We mitigate default risk by generally investing in investment grade securities. 
 31 

We are also exposed to interest rate risk on borrowings under our Credit Agreement. As of September 30, 2024, we had 124.7 million outstanding on the floating rate term loan facility, and we have an interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of 124.7 million and a fixed interest rate of 4.039 . Under this swap agreement, we receive variable rate interest rate payments and pay fixed rate interest payments. The effect of this swap is to convert our floating rate interest expense to fixed interest rate expense. The interest rate swap is designated as a cash flow hedge. 
 For additional information regarding our forward currency exchange contracts and interest rate swap agreement, see Note 14 to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Report. 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 As of the end of the period covered by this Report, the Company s management (with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Chief Financial Officer (CFO)) conducted an evaluation pursuant to Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act). Based on this evaluation, the CEO and CFO concluded that as of the end of the period covered by this Report, such disclosure controls and procedures were effective at a reasonable assurance level to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including the CEO and CFO, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 There has been no change in the Company s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that occurred during the last fiscal quarter covered by this Report that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting. 
 We are currently upgrading our ERP system, which is expected to occur in phases over the next several years. We have completed the implementation of the upgrades at certain of the Company s locations and have revised and updated the related controls. These changes did not materially affect our internal control over financial reporting. As we implement the upgrades of this ERP system at the remaining locations over the next several years, we will continue to assess the impact on our internal control over financial reporting. 
 A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within a company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple errors or mistakes. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by individuals acts, by collusion of two or more people, or by management overriding the control. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, a control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.
