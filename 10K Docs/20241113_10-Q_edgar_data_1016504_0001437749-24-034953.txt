IHT Properties and Vitamin Factory (collectively, the Borrowers amended the Revolving Credit, Term Loan and Security Agreement (the Amended Loan Agreement with PNC Bank, National Association as agent and lender PNC and the other lenders party thereto entered into on June 27, 2012, as amended on February 19, 2016, May 15, 2019, June 28, 2019 and March 16, 2023. 
 
 The Amended Loan Agreement provides for a total of in senior secured financing (the Senior Credit Facility as follows: (i) discretionary advances Revolving Advances based on eligible accounts receivable and eligible inventory in the maximum amount of (the Revolving Credit Facility ). The Senior Credit Facility is secured by all assets of the Borrowers, including, without limitation, machinery and equipment, and real estate owned by IHT Properties. Revolving Advances bear interest at PNC s Base Rate and as of September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024) or the Term SOFR Rate plus the SOFR Adjustment. The Term SOFR Rate, for any day, shall be equal to the secured overnight financing rate as administered by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (or a successor administrator of the secured overnight financing rate). The SOFR Adjustment is defined as basis points 0.10 ). As of November 7, 2024, the PNC Base Rate was . 

Upon and after the occurrence of any event of default under the Amended Loan Agreement, and during the continuation thereof, interest shall be payable at the interest rate then applicable plus . The Senior Credit Facility matures on May 9, 2026 the Senior Maturity Date ). 
 
 The principal balance of the Revolving Advances is payable on the Senior Maturity Date, subject to acceleration, based upon a material adverse event clause, as defined, subjective accelerations for borrowing base reserves, as defined or upon the occurrence of any event of default under the Amended Loan Agreement or earlier termination of the Amended Loan Agreement pursuant to the terms thereof. 
 
 The Revolving Advances are subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Amended Loan Agreement and are made in aggregate amounts at any time equal to the lesser of x or (y) an amount equal to the sum of: (i) up to , subject to the provisions in the Amended Loan Agreement, of eligible accounts receivables Receivables Advance Rate ), plus (ii) up to the lesser of (A) , subject to the provisions in the Amended Loan Agreement, of the value of the eligible inventory Inventory Advance Rate and together with the Receivables Advance Rate, collectively, the Advance Rates ), (B) of the appraised net orderly liquidation value of eligible inventory (as evidenced by the most recent inventory appraisal reasonably satisfactory to PNC in its sole discretion exercised in good faith) and (C) the inventory sublimit in the aggregate at any one time Inventory Advance Rate and together with the Receivables Advance Rate, collectively, the Advance Rates ), minus (iii) the aggregate Maximum Undrawn Amount, as defined in the Amended Loan Agreement, of all outstanding letters of credit, minus (iv) such reserves as PNC may reasonably deem proper and necessary from time to time.

These two customers are in the Company s Contract Manufacturing Segment and represented approximately and and and in the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Accounts receivable from these two major customers represented approximately and of total net accounts receivable as of September 30 and June 30, 2024, respectively. Three other customers in the other Nutraceutical Segment, while not significant customers of the Company s consolidated net sales, represented approximately 39 , and and and and , respectively, of net sales of the Other Nutraceutical Segment in the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

 The loss of any of these customers could have an adverse effect on the Company s operations. Major customers are those customers who account for more than 10 of net sales. 
 
 (b) Other Business Risks. Approximately of the Company s full time employees are covered by a union contract and are employed in its New Jersey facilities. The contract was renewed effective September 1, 2022 and will expire on August 31, 2026. 
 
 The Company has seen a negative impact in its margins due to inflation and tightened labor markets. The Company may not be able to timely increase its selling prices to its customer resulting from price increases from its suppliers due to various economic factors, including inflation, labor and shipping costs and its own increases in shipping, labor and other operating costs. The Company s results of operations may also be affected by economic conditions, including inflationary pressures, that can impact consumer disposable income levels and spending habits, thereby reducing the orders it may receive from the Company s significant customers. 

The Company continues to experience minimal supply chain disruptions relating to fuel refinery and transportation issues as it pertains to shipping. These issues first arose as result of the COVID- 19 pandemic and other geo-political events. Additionally, the East Coast port strike threatened the supply of goods and continues to threaten as the contract was extended through January 15, 2025 and U.S. shippers are steering clear of the East and Gulf Coast ports amid worries that the dockworkers at these ports will go on strike again. 
 
 During the first calendar quarter 2022, the war in Ukraine affected the Company s customer s business operations in Ukraine and Russia, resulting in the cancelation of some future orders. The war resulted in the imposition of sanctions by the United States, the United Kingdom, and the European Union, that affect the cross-border operations of businesses operating in Russia. In addition, many multinational companies ceased or suspended their operations in Russia. Therefore, the ability to continue operations in Russia by the Company s customers is uncertain. 
 
 Additionally, the current Israel-Hamas war in the Middle East could negatively impact the sales and margins of the Company. Certain customers sell into Israel and the Company sources certain raw materials from Israel. If the Israel-Hamas war carries on for a significant time frame, it could have a negative impact on the sales and margins of the Company if the Company is unable to replace these sales with other sales and/or obtain the same raw materials at substantially the same price as currently paid.

 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company incurred stock-based compensation expense of and , respectively. The Company expects to record additional stock-based compensation of over the remaining vesting periods of approximately one to three years for all non-vested stock options. 
 
 The Company used the following assumptions to calculate the fair value of the stock option grants using the Black-Scholes option pricing model on the measurement date during the three months ended September 30, 2024: 

Volatility 
 Expected Term 10 years 
 Dividend Rate 
 Closing Price of Common Stock 
 Closing Price of Common Stock 

The Company calculates expected volatility for a stock-based grant based on historic daily stock price observations of its common stock during the period immediately preceding the grant that is equal in length to the expected term of the grant. The expected term of the options is estimated based on the Company s historical exercise rate and forfeiture rates are estimated based on employment termination experience.

Item 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANICAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION (dollars in thousands) 
 
 Certain statements set forth under this caption constitute forward-looking statements. See Disclosure Regarding Forward-Looking Statements on page 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional factors relating to such statements. The following discussion should also be read in conjunction with the condensed consolidated financial statements of the Company and Notes thereto included herein and the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024. 
 
 The Company is engaged primarily in the business of manufacturing, distributing, marketing and sales of vitamins, nutritional supplements and herbal products. The Company s customers are located primarily in the United States and Luxembourg. 
 
 Business Outlook 
 
 Our future results of operations and the other forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including this Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation , involve a number of risks and uncertainties in particular, the statements regarding our goals and strategies, new product introductions, plans to cultivate new businesses, future economic conditions, revenue, pricing, gross margin and costs, competition, the tax rate, and potential legal proceedings. We are focusing our efforts to improve operational efficiency and reduce spending that may have an impact on expense levels and gross margin. In addition to the various important factors discussed above, a number of other important factors could cause actual results to differ significantly from our expectations. See the risks described in Risk Factors in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024. 
 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, our net sales from operations increased by 702 to approximately 13,617 from approximately 12,915 in the three months ended September 30, 2023. Our net sales in the Contract Manufacturing Segment increased by 536, and in Other Nutraceuticals, increased by 166. The increase in net sales in our Contract Manufacturing Segment of 536 was primarily due to increased sales volumes to Herbalife in the amount of 393 and other customers of 776, offset by decreased sales volumes to Life Extension of 632 and an increase of sales in the other Nutraceuticals Segment of 166 compared to the year ago comparable period. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, a significant portion of our consolidated net sales, approximately 85 and 91 , respectively, were concentrated among two customers, Life Extension and Herbalife, in our Contract Manufacturing Segment. Life Extension and Herbalife, represented approximately 68 and 21 and 76 and 19 , respectively, of our Contract Manufacturing Segment s net sales in the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The loss of any of these customers could have a significant adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. Revenues in the three months ended September 30, 2024 were higher than the three months ended September 30, 2023 in our Other Nutraceuticals Segment by 166, due to increased sales in MDC WHD and Chem s distributor business in the amount of 104 and 62, respectively. 
 
 Our net income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was approximately 259 compared to a net loss of approximately 59 in the three months ended September 30, 2023. The change of approximately 318 was primarily the result of increased operating income of 544, offset by the increase income tax expense of 232. Our profit margins increased from approximately 6.4 of net sales in the three months ended September 30, 2023 to approximately 10.1 of net sales in the three months ended September 30, 2024, primarily as a result of the increased cost of sales of approximately 5.4 while our cost of goods sold increased by approximately 1 . were substantially the same for the three months ended September 30 2024 and 2023, approximately 881 to 886, respectively. 
 
 Our revenue from our two significant customers in our Contract Manufacturing Segment is dependent on their demand within their respective distribution channels for the products we manufacture for them. As in any competitive market, our ability to match or beat other contract manufacturers pricing for the same items may also alter our outlook and the ability to maintain or increase revenues. We will continue to focus on our core businesses and push forward in maintaining our cost structure in line with our sales and expanding our customer base. We believe that this focus will produce a reduction of the reliance on our two significant customers in our fiscal year ending June 30, 2025. 

-17-

We have seen a negative impact in our margins due to inflation and tightened labor markets. We may not be able to timely increase our selling prices to our customers resulting from price increases from our suppliers due to various economic factors, including inflation, labor and shipping costs and our own increases in shipping, labor and other operating costs. Our results of operations may also be affected by economic conditions, including inflationary pressures, that can impact consumer disposable income levels and spending habits, thereby reducing the orders we may receive from our significant customers. 
 
 We continue to experience minimal supply chain disruptions relating to fuel refinery and transportation issues as it pertains to shipping. These issues first arose as result of the COVID-19 pandemic and other geo-political events. Additionally, the East Coast port strike threatened the supply of goods and continues to threaten as the contract was extended through January 15, 2025 and U.S. shippers are steering clear of the East and Gulf Coast ports amid worries that the dockworkers at these ports will go on strike again. 
 
 During the first quarter of calendar 2022, the war in Ukraine affected our customer s business operations in Ukraine and Russia, resulting in the cancelation of some future orders. The war resulted in the imposition of sanctions by the United States, the United Kingdom, and the European Union, that affect the cross-border operations of businesses operating in Russia. In addition, many multinational companies ceased or suspended their operations in Russia. Therefore, the ability to continue operations in Russia by our customers is uncertain. 
 
 Additionally, the current Israel-Hamas war in the Middle East could negatively impact our sales and margins. Certain of our customers sell into Israel and we source certain raw materials from Israel. If the Israel-Hamas war carries on for a significant time frame, it could have a negative impact on our sales and margins if we are unable to replace these sales with other sales and/or obtain the same raw materials at substantially the same price as currently paid. 
 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 
 There have been no changes to our critical accounting estimates in the three months ended September 30, 2024. Critical accounting estimates made in accordance with our accounting policies are regularly discussed by management with our Audit Committee. Those estimates are discussed under Critical Accounting Estimates in our Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2024.

For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, a significant portion of our consolidated net sales, approximately 85 and 91 , respectively, were concentrated among two customers, Life Extension and Herbalife, in our Contract Manufacturing Segment. Life Extension and Herbalife, represented approximately 68 and 21 and 76 and 19 , respectively, of our Contract Manufacturing Segment s net sales in the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 
 The increase in net sales of approximately 702 in the three months ended September 30, 2024, was primarily the result of increased net sales in our Contract Manufacturing Segment of 536 primarily due to increased sales volumes to Herbalife in the amount of 393 and other customers of 776, respectively, offset by decreased sales volumes to Life Extension of 632 and an increase of sales in the other Nutraceuticals Segment of 166 compared to the year ago comparable period. 

-19-

Revenues in the three months ended September 30, 2024 were higher than the three months ended September 30, 2023 in our Other Nutraceuticals Segment by 166, primarily due to increased sales in MDC WHD and Chem s distributor business in the amount of 104 and 62, respectively. Three other customers in the other Nutraceutical Segment, while not significant customers of the Company s consolidated net sales, represented approximately 39 , 28 and 10 and 0 , 41 and 2 , respectively, of net sales of the Other Nutraceutical Segment in the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 
 Cost of sales. Cost of sales increased by approximately 163 to 12,246 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 12,083 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, or approximately 1.3 . Cost of sales decreased as a percentage of sales to 89.9 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 93.6 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease of 1.3 in the dollar amount of cost of goods sold is lower than the increase in sales due to the prior year issue of not being able to bill all the freight costs in the Other Nutraceutical Segment to our customers. This benefit was offset by an increase in our Contract Manufacturing costs of 15 , including; labor costs, increased costs to run our laboratory, including increased pricing from our outside testing facilities and other factory expenses. 
 
 Selling and Administrative Expenses. Selling and administrative expenses were substantially the same for the three months ended September 30 2024 and 2023, approximately 881 to 886, respectively. As a percentage of sales, net, selling and administrative expenses were approximately 6.5 and 6.8 in the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Our non-cash stock compensation decreased by 19 and was offset by an increase in all other general expenses of 13, with no one expense increasing or decreasing by more than 10. Non-cash stock compensation decreased due to fewer stock options issued in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024, compared to prior years. Our stock options generally vest over three years and are granted each year to our Directors, officers and other key employees in our Company as additional compensation and to align the goals with our shareholders . 
 
 Interest Income, net. Interest income, net was approximately 14 and 8 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 and represents interest earned on our cash in the bank offset by interest expense and other financing costs under our Senior Credit Facility with PNC. 
 
 Income tax expense, net. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company had federal income tax expense of 190 and 6, respectively and state income tax expense, net of approximately 54 and 7, in the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 
 Net income (loss). Our net income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was approximately 259 compared to a net loss of approximately 59 in the three months ended September 30, 2023. The change of approximately 318 was primarily the result of increased operating income of 544, offset by the increase income tax expense of 232. 
 
 Seasonality 
 
 The nutraceutical business can be seasonal. Due to our current customer base in our contract manufacturing segment, our fiscal quarter ending December 31st each year tends to be more than our average quarterly volume for the other three fiscal quarters in the fiscal year. This increase is based on their forecast of their customer base. 
 
 The Company believes that there are non-seasonal factors that may influence the variability of quarterly results including, but not limited to, general economic and industry conditions that affect consumer spending, changing consumer demands and current news on nutritional supplements. Accordingly, a comparison of the Company s results of operations from consecutive periods is not necessarily meaningful, and the Company s results of operations for any period are not necessarily indicative of future periods.
