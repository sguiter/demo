For purposes of the maturity table, mortgage-backed securities, which are not due at a single maturity date, have been allocated over maturity groupings based on the weighted-average contractual maturities of underlying collateral. The mortgage-backed securities generally mature earlier than their weighted-average contractual maturities because of principal prepayments.

Available-for-Sale Considerations For any securities classified as available-for-sale that are in an unrealized loss position as of the balance sheet date, the Company assesses whether or not it intends to sell the security, or more-likely-than-not will be required to sell the security, before recovery of its amortized cost basis which would require a write-down to fair value through net income. As of September 30, 2024 , available-for-sale debt securities had been in a loss position for more than 12 months, and there were available-for-sale debt securities that had been in a loss position for less than 12 months. As of December 31, 2023 , available-for-sale debt securities had been in a loss position for more than 12 months, and available-for-sale debt securities had been in a loss position for less than 12 months. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had the current intent and ability to retain its investments for a period of time that management believes to be sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery of fair value. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the losses for all available-for-sale securities were considered to be a direct result of the effect that the prevailing interest rate environment had on the value of debt securities and were not related to the creditworthiness of the issuers. Accordingly, no allowance for credit losses was considered necessary related to available-for-sale securities as of September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023. Held-to-Maturity Considerations Effective January 1, 2023, the Company adopted the current expected credit loss ("CECL") accounting model to evaluate credit losses in the held-to-maturity investment portfolio. Each quarter, management evaluates the portfolio on a collective basis by major security type to determine whether an allowance for credit losses is needed. Qualitative factors are used in the Company s credit loss assessments, including current and forecasted economic conditions, the characteristics of the debt issuer, and the historic ability of the issuer to make contractual principal and interest payments. Specifically, with regard to mortgage-backed securities or obligations of U.S. government sponsored agencies thereof, it is expected that the securities will not be settled at prices less than the amortized cost bases of the securities as such securities are either backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government or the agency. With regard to obligations of states and political subdivisions, management considers issuer bond ratings, historical loss rates for given bond ratings, and whether the issuers continue to make timely principal and interest payments under contractual terms of the securities. Based on these evaluations, allowance for credit losses was recorded by the Company for the held-to-maturity investment portfolio as of September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023. Pledged Securities Investment securities with a carrying value of million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , respectively, were pledged to secure public deposits and for other purposes.

The Company makes commercial, real estate and installment loans to its customers. Although the Company has a diversified loan portfolio, and of the portfolio was concentrated in loans secured by real estate as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Loans with a carrying value of million and million were pledged as collateral to secure Federal Home Loan Bank FHLB borrowings as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , respectively. In addition, loans with a carrying value of million and million were pledged to secure borrowings with the Federal Reserve Bank ("FRB") as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Related Party Loans In the ordinary course of business, the Bank makes loans to certain officers and directors of the Company, including companies with which they are associated. These loans are made on the same terms as those prevailing for comparable transactions with unrelated parties. Management believes that such loans do not represent more than a normal risk of collectability, nor do they present other unfavorable features. The aggregate balances of such related party loans and commitments were million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The increase comparing the balance at September 30, 2024 to December 31, 2023 resulted primarily from new board membership. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , there were new loans of thousand to active related parties, and repayments of million made by these parties. During the year ended December 31, 2023, there were new loans of million to active related parties, and repayments made by these parties. Allowances for Credit Losses Effective January 1, 2023, the Company adopted the CECL model to account for credit losses on financial instruments, including loans and leases held for investment, as well as off-balance sheet credit exposures including unfunded lending commitments. In accordance with the CECL accounting guidance, the Company recorded a cumulative-effect adjustment totaling million, of which million (net of tax) was recorded through retained earnings upon adoption of the model. This amount included estimates for credit losses associated with both loan and lease receivables, as well as unfunded lending commitments. Prospectively, following the date of adoption, all adjustments for credit losses are required to be recorded as a provision for (recovery of) credit losses in the Company s consolidated statement of operations. Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans and Leases The Company records the allowance for credit losses on loans and leases as a contra-asset valuation account that is deducted from the amortized cost basis of loans and leases held for investment. Loans are charged off against the allowance when management believes that the uncollectibility of a loan balance is confirmed. Recoveries of previously charged off loans are also recorded to the allowance when collected. As of each quarter-end date, the Company evaluates the appropriateness of the allowance for credit losses on loans and leases and adjusts the allowance through the provision for (recovery of) credit losses. Determining the appropriateness of the allowance for credit losses on loans and leases is complex and requires judgment by management about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. The level of the allowance is influenced by loan and lease volumes and mix, historical credit loss experience, estimated remaining life of portfolio segments, asset quality characteristics, delinquency status, and other conditions including 

 16 

million or more are evaluated on an individual basis. At management's discretion, other loans may be evaluated, including loans less than million, if management determines that the loans exhibit unique risk characteristics. For loans individually evaluated, the allowance is based primarily on the fair value of the underlying collateral, less any estimated costs to sell, as applicable, utilizing independent third-party appraisals, and assessment of borrower guarantees. The fair value is compared to the amortized cost basis of the loan to determine if an allowance for credit losses should be recognized. For estimating the component of the allowance for credit losses that share similar risk characteristics, loans are segregated into pooled loan categories that share risk characteristics. Loans are designated into pooled categories based on product types, business lines, collateral, and other risk characteristics. For all pooled loan categories, the Company uses a loss-rate methodology to calculate estimated life-of-loan and lease credit losses. This methodology focuses on historical credit loss rates applied over the estimated weighted average remaining life of each loan pool, adjusted by qualitative factors, to estimate life-of-loan losses for each pool. The qualitative factors utilized include, among others, reasonable and supportable forecasts of economic data, including inflation and unemployment levels, as well as interest rates. Allowance for Credit Losses on Unfunded Lending Commitments Unfunded lending commitments are off-balance sheet arrangements that represent unconditional commitments of the Company to lend to a borrower that are unfunded as of the balance sheet date. These may include unfunded loan commitments, standby letters of credit, and financial guarantees. The CECL accounting guidance requires that an estimate of expected credit loss be measured on commitments in which an entity is exposed to credit risk via a present contractual obligation to extend credit unless the obligation is unconditionally cancellable by the issuer. For the Company, unconditional lending commitments generally include unfunded term loan agreements, home equity lines of credit, lines of credit, and demand deposit account overdraft protection. As of each quarter-end date, the Company estimates expected credit losses on unfunded lending commitments over the contractual period in which the Company is exposed to credit risk via a contractual obligation to extend credit unless that obligation is unconditionally cancellable by the Company. The allowance for credit losses on unfunded lending commitments is recorded in other liabilities, and adjustments to the allowance are recorded through the provision for (recovery of) credit losses.

Loan Modifications Made to Borrowers Experiencing Financial Difficulty From time to time, the Company may modify the terms of loan agreements with borrowers that are experiencing financial difficulties. Modification of the terms of such loans typically include one or a combination of the following: a reduction of the stated interest rate of the loan; an extension of the maturity date at a stated rate of interest lower than the current market rate for new debt with similar risk; or a permanent reduction of the recorded investment in the loan. No modifications in 2024 or 2023 resulted in the permanent reduction of the recorded investment in the loan. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company did not modify any loans to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty, and there were no payment defaults on loans that were modified in the previous twelve months.

forward starting interest rate swap contracts with the objective of protecting the Company against variability in expected future cash flows attributed to changes in the SOFR interest rate on the designated notional of interest-bearing liabilities. Each of the contracts has a million notional amount, or million in aggregate. The interest rate swaps were designated as derivative instruments in cash flow hedges. In accordance with the related contracts, the Company pays a fixed interest rate and receives a variable interest rate based on the SOFR, on the notional amounts, with quarterly net settlements. The swap contracts are scheduled to terminate on and . As of September 30, 2024, the hedge relationships for both swaps were designated effective, and accordingly, changes in the fair value of the contracts were included as an adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income. Fair Value Hedges In June 2023, the Company entered into forward interest rate swap contracts on a pool of fixed rate indirect consumer loans. Each of the three contracts has a million notional amount, or million in aggregate. The interest rate swaps were designated as derivative instruments in fair value hedges with the objective of effectively converting a pool of fixed rate indirect consumer loans to a variable rate throughout the hedge durations in accordance with the portfolio layer method. In accordance with the related contracts, for each swap, the Company pays a fixed interest rate and receives a variable interest rate based on the SOFR, on the notional amounts, with monthly net settlements. The swap contracts are scheduled to terminate at different maturity dates, including , , and . As of both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the hedge relationships for all three swaps were designated effective, and accordingly, changes in the fair value of the contracts were included as adjustment to the underlying fixed rate consumer loans. Interest Rate Floors In March 2024, the Company entered into interest rate floor contracts, each with a notional amount of million, or million in aggregate. The interest rate floor contracts were not designated as hedging instruments, and accordingly, changes in the fair value of the contracts are being recorded as non-interest income or expense over the term of each contract. Both of the derivative contracts are intended to mitigate the Company s risk of loss associated with downward shifts in the SOFR. One of the contracts will provide cash flow to the Company in the event the SOFR decreases below before the contract s designated termination date of , while the other contract will provide cash flow to the Company in the event the SOFR decreases below prior to the contract s designated termination date of . Credit Derivatives In September 2024, the Company entered into a credit risk participation agreement with a lead participant bank with which the Company shares a participation loan. For participating in the agreement, the Company received a one-time fee which was included in other liabilities. The derivative is not eligible for hedge accounting treatment. Accordingly, valuation changes are recorded directly to non-interest income or expense. Previously Terminated Hedges In February 2023, the Company voluntarily terminated interest rates swap contracts, each with notional amounts of million, or an aggregate amount of million. Two of the swaps were previously designated as cash flow hedges, while two were previously designated as fair value hedges. The termination of the cash flow hedges resulted in a net unrealized gain totaling million. The unrealized gain was initially recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax, and is being reclassified to reduce interest expense over the original terms of the swap contracts. Remaining unrealized gains associated with these terminated cash flow hedges totaled million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The termination of the fair value hedges resulted in an unrealized gain totaling million which is being reclassified to increase interest income over the original terms of the swap contracts. Remaining unrealized gains associated with the fair value hedges totaled zero and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. In May 2022, the Company voluntarily terminated interest rate swap contract with a notional amount of million. The swap was previously designated as a cash flow hedge. The termination resulted in a net unrealized gain of million. The unrealized gain was initially recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax, and was reclassified to reduce interest expense over the original term of the swap contract. Remaining unrealized gains associated with this terminated cash flow hedge totaled and thousand as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.

Standby letters of credit and standby performance letters of credit are contingent commitments issued by the Bank generally to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. The Bank has recourse against the customer for any amount that it is required to pay to a third party under a standby letter of credit or standby performance letter of credit. Revenues are recognized over the lives of the standby letters of credit and standby performance letters of credit.

Additional discussion related to the calculation of the allowance for unfunded commitments is included in Note 4, "Loans and Leases". Self-Insurance The Company is self-insured for a significant portion of employee health benefits. However, the Company maintains stop-loss coverage with third-party insurers to limit the Company s individual claim and total exposure related to self-insurance. The Company estimates a liability for the ultimate costs to settle known claims, as well as claims incurred but not yet reported, as of the balance sheet date. The Company s recorded estimated liability for self-insurance is based on the insurance companies' incurred loss estimates and management s judgment, including assumptions and evaluation of factors related to the frequency and severity of claims, the Company s claims development history and the Company s claims settlement practices. The assessment of loss contingencies and self-insurance reserves is a highly subjective process that requires judgments about future events. Contingencies are reviewed at least quarterly to determine the adequacy of self-insurance accruals. Self-insurance accruals totaled million as of both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The ultimate settlement of loss contingencies and self-insurance reserves may differ significantly from amounts accrued in the Company s consolidated financial statements. Litigation The Company is party to certain ordinary course litigation, and intends to vigorously defend itself in all such litigation. In the opinion of the Company, based on review and consultation with legal counsel, the outcome of such ordinary course litigation should not have a material adverse effect on the Company s consolidated financial statements or results of operations.

such transfers during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 or the year ended December 31, 2023. Fair Value Measurements on a Recurring Basis Securities Available-for-Sale Where quoted market prices are available in an active market, securities are classified within Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy. Level 1 securities include U.S. Treasury securities. Level 2 securities include government sponsored agency securities, mortgage-backed agency securities, obligations of states and political subdivisions and certain corporate, asset-backed and other securities. Level 2 fair values are obtained from quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics. In certain cases, where Level 1 or Level 2 inputs are not available, securities are classified within Level 3 of the hierarchy. Interest Rate Derivative Contracts Interest rate derivative contracts are used by the Company to mitigate risk associated with changes in interest rates. The fair value of these contracts is based on information obtained from third-party financial institutions. This information is periodically evaluated by the Company and, as necessary, corroborated against other third-party valuations. The Company classifies these derivative assets within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy.

Fair Value Measurements on a Non-recurring Basis Impaired Loans Loans are considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect all principal and interest payments due under the contractual terms of the loan agreement. These loans are evaluated separately in accordance with the Company s policies for calculating the allowance for credit losses on loans and leases. The fair value of impaired loans with specific allocations of the allowance for credit losses on loans and leases is typically based on recent real estate appraisals. These appraisals may utilize a single valuation approach or a combination of approaches including comparable sales and the income approach. Adjustments are routinely made in the appraisal process by independent appraisers to adjust for differences between the comparable sales and income data available. Appraised values are discounted by management for estimated costs to sell and may be discounted further based on management s knowledge of the collateral, changes in market conditions since the most recent appraisal and/or management s knowledge of the borrower and the borrower s business. Such adjustments are usually significant and typically result in Level 3 classification of the inputs for determining fair value. Non-real estate collateral may be valued using an appraisal, net book value per the borrower s financial statements, or aging reports, adjusted or discounted based on management s historical knowledge of the borrower s business, resulting in a Level 3 fair value classification. Impaired loans are evaluated on a quarterly basis for additional impairment and adjusted accordingly.

Investment securities: Fair values of investment securities are based on quoted market prices where available. If quoted market prices are not available, estimated fair values are based on market prices of comparable instruments. Derivative instruments: The fair value of derivative instruments is based on information obtained from a third-party financial institution. This information is periodically evaluated by the Company and, as necessary, corroborated against other third-party information. Accrued interest receivable and payable: The carrying amount of accrued interest approximates fair value. Loans, net: The fair value of loans is estimated on an exit price basis incorporating contractual cash flow, prepayment discount spreads, credit loss and liquidity premiums. Demand and savings deposits: The fair values of demand deposits are equal to the carrying value of such deposits. Demand deposits include non-interest-bearing demand deposits, savings accounts, NOW accounts and money market demand accounts. Time deposits: The fair values of relatively short-term time deposits are equal to their carrying values. Discounted cash flows are used to value long-term time deposits. The discount rate used is based on interest rates currently offered by the Company on comparable deposits as to amount and term. Short-term borrowings: These borrowings may consist of federal funds purchased, securities sold under agreements to repurchase and the floating rate borrowings from the FHLB account. Due to the short-term nature of these borrowings, fair values approximate carrying values. Long-term debt: The fair value of this debt is estimated using discounted cash flows based on the Company s current incremental borrowing rate for similar types of borrowing arrangements as of the determination date.

ITEM 2.	MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 DESCRIPTION OF THE BUSINESS 
 
 First US Bancshares, Inc., a Delaware corporation Bancshares and, together with its subsidiary, the Company ), is a bank holding company formed in 1983 registered under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the BHCA ). Bancshares operates one wholly owned banking subsidiary, First US Bank, an Alabama banking corporation (the Bank ). Bancshares and the Bank are headquartered in Birmingham, Alabama. Previously, the Bank operated two additional wholly owned subsidiaries, Acceptance Loan Company and FUSB Reinsurance, Inc., both of which were legally dissolved in 2023, and all remaining assets and liabilities of these entities were transferred to the Bank prior to December 31, 2023. 
 
 The Bank conducts a general commercial banking business and offers banking services such as demand, savings, individual retirement account and time deposits, personal and commercial loans, safe deposit box services and remote deposit capture. The Bank operates and serves its customers through 15 full-service banking offices located in Birmingham, Butler, Calera, Centreville, Gilbertown, Grove Hill, Harpersville, Jackson, Thomasville, Tuscaloosa and Woodstock, Alabama; Knoxville and Powell, Tennessee; and Rose Hill, Virginia; as well as loan production offices in Mobile, Alabama and the Chattanooga, Tennessee area. The Bank provides a wide range of commercial banking services to small- and medium-sized businesses, property managers, business executives, professionals and other individuals. The Bank also performs indirect lending through third-party retailers and currently conducts this lending in 17 states, including Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas and Virginia. The Bank is the Company s only reportable operating segment upon which management makes decisions regarding how to allocate resources and assess performance. 
 Delivery of the best possible financial services to customers remains an overall operational focus of the Company. The Company recognizes that attention to detail and responsiveness to customers desires are critical to customer satisfaction. The Company continues to upgrade technology, both in its financial services and in the training of its 154 full-time equivalent employees (as of September 30, 2024), to ensure customer satisfaction and convenience. 
 The preparation of the Company s consolidated financial statements requires management to make subjective judgments associated with critical accounting estimates. These estimates are necessary to comply with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America U.S. GAAP and general banking practices. A description of the Company's critical accounting estimates, which significantly affect the determination of the Company s consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows, is set forth in Part II, Item 7 - Critical Accounting Estimates in the Company's 2023 Form 10-K. 
 The emphasis of this discussion is a comparison of assets, liabilities and shareholders equity as of September 30, 2024 to December 31, 2023, while comparing income and expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. All yields and ratios presented and discussed herein are recorded and presented on the accrual basis and not on the tax-equivalent basis, unless otherwise indicated. 
 This information should be read in conjunction with the Company s unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this report and Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations appearing in the Company's 2023 Form 10-K. As used in the following discussion, the words we, us, our and the Company refer to Bancshares and its consolidated subsidiaries, unless the context indicates otherwise. 
 RECENT MARKET CONDITIONS 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the banking industry continued to be impacted by economic volatility and the higher interest rate environment that has persisted since 2022. The U.S. inflation rate, as measured by the consumer price index, slowed for a sixth consecutive month in September 2024 to 2.4 . While the inflation rate remained elevated above the Federal Reserve Bank s FRB longer run target of 2 , the trend downward led the Open Market Committee of the FRB to reduce the federal funds rate by 50 basis points, bringing the target federal funds rate to a range of 4.75 to 5.00 as of September 30, 2024. This signaled at least a partial shift in focus by the FRB to managing employment levels more closely, while continuing to monitor inflation levels. The U.S. unemployment rate trended lower during the third quarter of 2024, easing to 4.1 in September 2024, while the U.S. economy, as measured by gross domestic product, expanded at an annualized pace of 2.8 in the third quarter of 2024. U.S. Treasury rates decreased substantially during the third quarter of 2024, with short term rates generally decreasing in greater magnitude than long term rates causing a flattening of the treasury curve. While benchmark interest rates eased during the third quarter of 2024, competitive pressures in the banking industry remained elevated, particularly with respect to deposit pricing. In addition, geopolitical uncertainty on the world stage, as well as political uncertainty with respect to the U.S. election cycle, persisted through the quarter. Management continues to carefully navigate the Company s course through these challenges, and believes the Company is well positioned to respond effectively in multiple operating environments. However, additional inflationary pressure, higher interest rates, and a fiercely competitive environment could put downward pressure on the Company s financial position and results of operations.

The discussion that follows summarizes the most significant activity that drove changes in the Company s operating results during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Net Interest Income and Margin 
 
 Net interest income decreased by 0.8 million, or 3.0 , comparing the nine months ended September 30, 2024 to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. In general, net interest margin has declined amid the higher interest rate environment that has persisted since 2022, as interest-bearing liabilities repriced at faster rates than interest-bearing assets. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net interest income totaled 27.4 million, compared to 28.2 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Net interest margin totaled 3.65 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 3.93 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Provision for Credit Losses 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the provision for credit losses totaled 0.2 million, compared to 0.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in the provision for credit losses comparing the first nine months of 2024 to the corresponding period of 2023 was due primarily to decreases in loan volume, as well as adjustments in economic forecasts that impact the calculation of the allowance for credit losses ("ACL") on loans and leases. As of September 30, 2024, the Company s ACL on loans and leases as a percentage of total loans was 1.26 , compared to 1.28 as of December 31, 2023. 
 Non-interest Income 
 
 Non-interest income remained relatively consistent, totaling 2.6 million and 2.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 
 43 

Non-interest Expense 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, non-interest expense totaled 21.4 million, compared to 21.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Salaries and benefits expense decreased during the first nine months of 2024 compared to the corresponding period of 2023, primarily due to lower staff levels resulting from strategic initiatives implemented by the Company in prior years. In addition, other expenses were lower during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the corresponding period of 2023, due primarily to the recovery of check fraud losses and reduced collection expenses. These reductions in non-interest expense during the first nine months of 2024 were partially offset by increases associated with occupancy and professional services expenses. 
 
 Total Assets 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company s assets totaled 1,100.2 million, compared to 1,072.9 million as of December 31, 2023, an increase of 2.5 . 
 
 Loans 
 
 Total loans decreased by 18.5 million, or 2.2 , as of September 30, 2024, compared to December 31, 2023. The decrease was primarily driven by payoffs of construction loans and, to a lesser extent, reductions in the consumer indirect and commercial and industrial ("C I") loan categories. These reductions were partially offset by growth in commercial real estate (non-farm, non-residential) and multi-family residential loans. While the Company experienced a reduction in loan volume during the first nine months of 2024, average loan balances remained higher than average loan balances during the corresponding period of 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, average total loans were 821.0 million, compared to 795.0 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Asset Quality 
 
 Nonperforming assets, including loans in non-accrual status and OREO, totaled 6.6 million as of September 30, 2024, compared to 3.0 million as of December 31, 2023. The increase in nonperforming assets resulted from two loans (from the C I and 1-4 family residential categories) that moved into non-accrual status during the third quarter of 2024. As a percentage of total assets, nonperforming assets totaled 0.60 as of September 30, 2024, compared to 0.28 as of December 31, 2023. Annualized net charge-offs as a percentage of average loans during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 totaled 0.10 , compared to 0.12 during the corresponding period of 2023. 
 
 Deposit Growth 
 
 Deposits totaled 981.1 million as of September 30, 2024, compared to 950.2 million as of December 31, 2023. The increase since December 31, 2023 was due primarily to increased interest-bearing time deposits and interest-bearing demand deposits, partially offset by decreased money market and savings accounts. Core deposits, which exclude time deposits of 250 thousand or more and all wholesale brokered deposits, totaled 833.5 million, or 85.0 of total deposits, as of September 30, 2024, compared to 819.5 million, or 86.2 of total deposits, as of December 31, 2023. 
 
 Deployment of Funds 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company held cash, federal funds sold and securities purchased under reverse repurchase agreements totaling 97.8 million, or 8.9 of total assets, compared to 59.8 million, or 5.6 of total assets, as of December 31, 2023. Investment securities, including both the available-for-sale and held-to-maturity portfolios, totaled 145.0 million as of September 30, 2024, compared to 136.7 million as of December 31, 2023. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, 27.5 million was invested in taxable U.S. agency-sponsored bonds, resulting in improved yields in the investment portfolio. As of September 30, 2024, the expected average life of securities in the investment portfolio was 4.1 years, compared to 3.9 years as of December 31, 2023. 
 
 Shareholders Equity 
 
 Shareholders equity increased by 7.9 million, or 8.7 , as of September 30, 2024, compared to December 31, 2023. The increase in shareholders equity during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 resulted primarily from earnings, net of dividends paid and repurchases of shares of the Company's common stock. In addition, shareholders' equity was positively impacted during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 by reductions in the Company's accumulated other comprehensive loss resulting from changes in market interest rates, as well as the maturity of lower yielding investment securities. 
 
 44 

Cash Dividends 
 
 The Company declared cash dividends totaling 0.15 per share on its common stock during both the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 
 Share Repurchases 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company repurchased 106,500 shares of its common stock at a weighted average price of 10.67 per share. The repurchases were completed under the Company s previously announced share repurchase program. As of September 30, 2024, 352,813 shares remained available for repurchase under the program. 
 
 Regulatory Capital 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Bank continued to maintain capital ratios at higher levels than required to be considered a well-capitalized institution under applicable banking regulations. As of September 30, 2024, the Bank s common equity Tier 1 capital and Tier 1 risk-based capital ratios were each 11.45 . Its total capital ratio was 12.63 , and its Tier 1 leverage ratio was 9.49 . 
 
 Liquidity 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company continued to maintain excess funding capacity sufficient to provide adequate liquidity for loan growth, capital expenditures and ongoing operations. The Company benefits from a strong core deposit base, a liquid investment securities portfolio and access to funding from a variety of sources, including federal funds lines with other banking institutions, Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) advances, the discount window of the Federal Reserve Bank (FRB), and brokered deposits. 
 
 Banking Center Growth 
 
 As part of the Company s overall growth strategy, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company opened a new banking center in the Bearden area of Knoxville, Tennessee that replaced the Bank s previously existing Knoxville-Bearden location. In addition, the Company commenced renovation of a banking center office in Daphne, Alabama that was purchased from another financial institution. This location is expected to serve as the Bank s initial deposit gathering facility in the Daphne/Mobile area, and it is anticipated that the location will open to the public in 2025. 
 
 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 Net Interest Income 
 
 Net interest income is calculated as the difference between interest and fee income generated from earning assets and the interest expense paid on deposits and borrowed funds. Fluctuations in interest rates, as well as volume and mix changes in earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, can materially impact net interest income. The Company s earning assets consist of loans, taxable and tax-exempt investments, Federal Home Loan Bank stock, federal funds sold by the Bank, securities purchased under reverse repurchase agreements and interest-bearing deposits in banks. Interest-bearing liabilities consist of interest-bearing demand deposits and savings and time deposits, as well as short- and long-term borrowings. 
 
 The following tables show the average balances of each principal category of assets, liabilities and shareholders equity for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Additionally, the tables provide an analysis of interest revenue or expense associated with each category, along with the accompanying yield or rate percentage. Net interest margin is calculated for each period presented as net interest income divided by average total interest-earning assets.

(839) 

Interest income increased by 5.0 million, comparing the nine months ended September 30, 2024 to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Of the increase, 3.5 million was attributable to higher average yields on interest-earning assets, while 1.5 million was attributable to growth in interest-earning assets comparing the two periods. The increase in average yield was attributable to the rise in market interest rates that began in 2022, continued in 2023 and generally persisted through the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 The increase in interest income was offset by an increase in interest expense of 5.8 million, comparing the nine months ended September 30, 2024 to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Of the increase, 4.9 million was attributable to the rise in market interest rates, while 0.9 million was attributable to growth in interest-bearing liabilities, primarily savings and time deposits. 
 
 The rising interest rate environment has caused compression of the Company s net interest margin in recent periods, as the cost of interest-bearing liabilities has generally increased at a faster pace than interest-earning assets. The Company s net interest margin during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 totaled 3.65 , compared to 3.93 during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. During the third quarter of 2024, the higher interest rate environment began to ease with notable reductions in yields on U.S. treasury instruments, as well as a 50-basis point reduction in the federal funds rate. Should interest rate reductions continue to occur, both the Company s interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities will be impacted. However, the speed with which interest revenues and expenses reprice can vary significantly based on a number of factors, including, but not limited to, existing contractual terms and the competitive environment, as well as loan and deposit customer behavior and preferences. Management continues to focus efforts to both maximize earning asset growth and reduce interest expense; however, the results of these efforts cannot be fully predicted. In addition, should market interest rates increase or decrease at significant levels, especially in a short period of time, the Company s net interest income could be negatively impacted. 
 48 

Provision for Credit Losses 
 
 The Company recorded a provision for credit losses of 0.2 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to a provision of 0.8 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in the provision for credit losses comparing the first nine months of 2024 to the corresponding period of 2023 was due primarily to decreases in loan volume, as well as adjustments in economic forecasts that impact the calculation of the ACL on loans and leases. As of September 30, 2024, the Company s ACL on loans and leases as a percentage of total loans was 1.26 , compared to 1.28 as of December 31, 2023. 
 
 Net charge-offs totaled 0.6 million for both the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. However, the ongoing timing of charge-offs, economic developments, and other factors that could impact the provision for credit losses cannot be fully predicted with certainty. Sustained levels of high inflation, combined with sustained elevated market interest rates, could negatively impact the Company s borrowers, which could lead to increased provisions for credit losses in the future.

Non-interest expense totaled 21.4 million and 21.7 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Salaries and benefits expense decreased during the first nine months of 2024 compared to the corresponding period of 2023, primarily due to lower staff levels resulting from strategic initiatives implemented by the Company in prior years. In addition, other expenses were lower during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the corresponding period of 2023, due primarily to the recovery of check fraud losses and reduced collection expenses. These reductions in non-interest expense during the first nine months of 2024 were partially offset by increases associated with occupancy and professional services expenses. 
 
 49 

Provision for Income Taxes 
 
 The provision for income taxes was 2.0 million for both the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, and the Company s effective tax rate was 23.5 and 24.4 , respectively, for the same periods. 
 
 The effective tax rate is impacted by recurring items, such as changes in tax-exempt interest income earned from bank-qualified municipal bonds and loans and the cash surrender value of bank-owned life insurance. Management makes decisions about whether to invest in tax-exempt instruments on a case-by-case basis after considering a number of factors, including investment return, credit quality and the consistency of such investments with the Company s overall strategy. The Company s effective tax rate is expected to fluctuate commensurate with the level of these investments as compared to total pre-tax income. 
 
 BALANCE SHEET ANALYSIS 
 Investment Securities 
 
 The investment securities portfolio is used by management to provide liquidity, to generate interest income and for use as collateral for public deposits and wholesale funding. Risk and return can be adjusted by altering the duration, composition and/or balance of the portfolio. The expected average life of securities in the investment portfolio was 4.1 years and 3.9 years as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 
 Available-for-sale securities are recorded at estimated fair value, with unrealized gains or losses recognized, net of taxes, in accumulated other comprehensive loss, a separate component of shareholders equity. As of September 30, 2024, available-for-sale securities totaled 144.3 million, or 99.5 of the total investment portfolio, compared to 135.6 million, or 99.2 of the total investment portfolio, as of December 31, 2023. Available-for-sale securities consisted of residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities, U.S. Treasury securities, corporate bonds, obligations of U.S. government-sponsored agencies, and obligations of state and political subdivisions. 
 
 Held-to-maturity securities are recorded at amortized cost and represent securities that the Company both intends and has the ability to hold to maturity. As of September 30, 2024, held-to-maturity securities totaled 0.8 million, or 0.5 of the total investment portfolio, compared to 1.1 million, or 0.8 of the total investment portfolio, as of December 31, 2023. Held-to-maturity securities consisted of commercial mortgage-backed securities, obligations of U.S. government-sponsored agencies, and obligations of state and political subdivisions. 
 
 Net unrealized losses in the available-for-sale portfolio totaled 4.7 million as of September 30, 2024, compared to 9.3 million as of December 31, 2023. Net unrealized losses within the available-for-sale portfolio were recognized, net of tax, in accumulated other comprehensive loss. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company evaluated both the available-for-sale and held-to-maturity portfolios for credit losses and concluded that no credit losses were included in either portfolio and that the unrealized losses in both portfolios resulted from the prevailing interest rate environment. 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company purchased 27.5 million in taxable U.S. agency-sponsored securities that are included in the available-for-sale portfolio. The purchased securities offset 23.6 million in proceeds received by the Company associated with maturities and prepayments in the portfolio. In the higher interest rate environment, the securities purchased have served to increase the Company s yield on taxable investment securities. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the yield on taxable investment securities totaled 2.95 , compared to 2.15 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 50 

Loans and Leases 
 
 The Company s total loan portfolio decreased by 18.5 million, or 2.2 , as of September 30, 2024, compared to December 31, 2023.

Allowance for Credit Losses on Unfunded Lending Commitments 
 
 Unfunded lending commitments are off-balance sheet arrangements that represent unconditional commitments of the Company to lend to a borrower that are unfunded as of the balance sheet date. These may include unfunded loan commitments, standby letters of credit, and financial guarantees. The CECL accounting guidance requires that an estimate of expected credit loss be measured on commitments in which an entity is exposed to credit risk via a present contractual obligation to extend credit unless the obligation is unconditionally cancellable by the issuer. For the Company, unconditional lending commitments generally include unfunded term loan agreements, home equity lines of credit, lines of credit, and demand deposit account overdraft protection. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company s reserve for unfunded commitments, which is recorded in other liabilities in the Company s consolidated balance sheets, totaled 0.5 million and 0.6 million, respectively.

Deposits 
 
 Total deposits increased to 981.1 million as of September 30, 2024, from 950.2 million as of December 31, 2023, an increase of 3.3 . Core deposits, which exclude time deposits of 250 thousand or more and all brokered deposits, provide a relatively stable funding source that supports earning assets. Core deposits totaled 833.5 million, or 85.0 of total deposits, as of September 30, 2024, compared to 819.5 million, or 86.2 of total deposits, as of December 31, 2023. 
 
 Core deposits have historically been the Company s primary source of funding and have enabled the Company to successfully meet both short-term and long-term liquidity needs. Management anticipates that core deposits will continue to be the Company s primary source of funding in the future. Management will continue to monitor deposit levels closely to help ensure an adequate level of funding for the Company s activities. However, various economic and competitive factors could affect this funding source in the future, including increased competition from other financial institutions in deposit gathering, national and local economic conditions and interest rate policies adopted by the FRB and other central banks. 
 53 

Other Interest-Bearing Liabilities 
 
 Other interest-bearing liabilities that are used by the Company as an alternative source of funds consist of federal funds purchased, securities sold under agreements to repurchase, FHLB advances, and subordinated debt. As of September 30, 2024, other interest-bearing liabilities totaled 1.3 of total interest-bearing liabilities, compared to 2.5 as of December 31, 2023. 
 Shareholders Equity 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, shareholders equity totaled 98.5 million, or 9.0 of total assets, compared to 90.6 million, or 8.4 of total assets, as of December 31, 2023. The increase in shareholders equity during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 resulted primarily from earnings, net of dividends paid and repurchases of shares of the Company's common stock. In addition, shareholders' equity was positively impacted during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 by reductions in the Company's accumulated other comprehensive loss resulting from changes in market interest rates, as well as the maturity of lower yielding investment securities. 
 
 During both the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company declared dividends totaling 0.15 per common share, or approximately 0.9 million in aggregate amount. Bancshares Board of Directors evaluates dividend payments based on the Company s level of earnings and the desire to maintain a strong capital base, as well as regulatory requirements relating to the payment of dividends. 
 
 In addition, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company completed the repurchase of 106,500 shares of its common stock at a weighted average price of 10.67 per share. The repurchases were completed under the Company s previously announced share repurchase program. As of September 30, 2024, 352,813 shares remained available for repurchase under the program. No shares were repurchased by the Company during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 
 The asset portion of the balance sheet provides liquidity primarily from the following sources: (1) excess cash and interest-bearing deposits in banks, (2) federal funds sold and securities purchased under reverse repurchase agreements, (3) principal payments and maturities of loans and (4) principal payments and maturities from the investment portfolio. Loans maturing or repricing in one year or less amounted to 246.9 million as of September 30, 2024 and 241.2 million as of December 31, 2023. Investment securities forecasted to mature or reprice in one year or less were estimated to be 29.5 million and 12.9 million of the investment portfolio as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 
 Although some securities in the investment portfolio have legal final maturities exceeding 10 years, a substantial percentage of the portfolio provides monthly principal and interest payments and consists of securities that are readily marketable and easily convertible into cash on short notice. The investment securities portfolio had an estimated average life of 4.1 years and 3.9 years as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. However, management does not rely solely upon the investment portfolio to generate cash flows to fund loans, capital expenditures, dividends, debt repayment and other cash requirements. These activities are also funded by cash flows from loan payments, as well as increases in deposits and short-term borrowings. 
 
 The liability portion of the balance sheet provides liquidity through interest-bearing and non-interest-bearing deposit accounts, which represent the Company s primary sources of funds. In addition, federal funds purchased, FHLB advances, securities sold under agreements to repurchase and short-term and long-term borrowings are additional sources of available liquidity. Liquidity management involves the continual monitoring of the sources and uses of funds to maintain an acceptable cash position. Long-term liquidity management focuses on considerations related to the total balance sheet structure. The Bank manages the pricing of its deposits to maintain a desired deposit balance. 
 
 The Company had zero and 10.0 million of outstanding borrowings under FHLB advances as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The Company's use of FHLB advances varies depending on fluctuations in deposits and other funding sources, as well as their use in interest rate hedging strategies. In addition, on October 1, 2021, the Company completed a private placement of 11.0 million in aggregate principal amount of fixed-to-floating rate subordinated notes that will mature on October 1, 2031. Net of unamortized debt issuance costs, the subordinated notes were recorded as long-term borrowings totaling 10.9 million and 10.8 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 
 The Company had up to 294.8 million and 279.4 million in remaining unused credit from the FHLB (subject to available collateral, which may include eligible investment securities and loans) as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. In addition, the Company had 48.0 million in unused established federal funds lines as of both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
 
 The Company also has access to the FRB s discount window. The discount window allows borrowing on pledged collateral that includes eligible investment securities and loans. In response to heightened liquidity concerns in the banking industry, during 2023 management undertook measures designed to enhance the Company s liquidity position. These procedures included holding higher levels of on-balance 
 54 

sheet cash, as well as enhancing the availability of off-balance sheet borrowing capacity. As part of these efforts, during the third quarter of 2023, the Company completed the establishment of additional borrowing capacity through the FRB's discount window, primarily via the pledging of the majority of the Company s indirect loan portfolio as collateral. Including the pledging of these loans, along with selected securities, the Company had 165.2 and 161.7 million in borrowing capacity with the FRB s discount window as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 
 The table below provides information on the Company s on-balance sheet liquidity, as well as readily available off-balance sheet sources of liquidity, as of both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

The table above calculates readily available liquidity by combining cash and cash equivalents, federal funds sold, securities purchased under reverse repurchase agreements and unencumbered investment security values on the Company s consolidated balance sheet with off-balance sheet liquidity that is readily available through unused collateral pledged to the FHLB and FRB, as well as unsecured lines of credit with other banks. Liquidity from pledgable investment securities and total readily available liquidity are non-GAAP measures used by management and regulators to analyze a portion of the Company's liquidity. Management uses these measures to evaluate the Company's liquidity position. 
 
 Pledgable investment securities are considered by management as a readily available source of liquidity since the Company has the ability to pledge the securities with the FHLB or FRB to obtain immediate funding. Both available-for-sale and held-for-maturity securities may be pledged at fair value with the FHLB and through the FRB discount window. The amounts shown as liquidity from pledgable investment securities represent total investment securities as recorded on the consolidated balance sheet, less reductions for securities already pledged and discounts expected to be taken by the lender to determine collateral value. 
 
 The unused lendable collateral value at the FHLB presented in the table represents only the amount immediately available to the Company from loans already pledged by the Company to the FHLB as of each consolidated balance sheet date presented. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company's total remaining credit availability with the FHLB was 294.8 million and 279.4 million, respectively, subject to the pledging of additional collateral which may include eligible investment securities and loans. In addition, the Company has access to additional sources of liquidity that generally could be obtained over a period of time. For example, the Company has access to unsecured brokered deposits through the wholesale funding markets. Management believes the Company s on-balance sheet and other readily available liquidity provide strong indicators of the Company s ability to fund obligations in a stressed liquidity environment. 
 
 Excluding wholesale brokered deposits, as of September 30, 2024, the Company had approximately 30 thousand deposit accounts with an average balance of approximately 30.4 thousand per account. Estimated uninsured deposits (calculated as deposit amounts per deposit holder in excess of 250 thousand, the maximum amount of federal deposit insurance, and excluding deposits secured by pledged assets) totaled 233.4 million, or 23.8 of total deposits, as of September 30, 2024. As of December 31, 2023, estimated uninsured deposits totaled 200.3 million, or 21.1 of total deposits. 
 
 Management believes that the Company has adequate sources of liquidity to cover its contractual obligations and commitments over the next twelve months.

ITEM 3.	QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATI VE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 
 The primary purpose of managing interest rate risk is to invest capital effectively and preserve the value created by the Company s core banking business. This is accomplished through the development and implementation of lending, funding, pricing and hedging strategies designed to maximize net interest income performance under varying interest rate environments, subject to liquidity and interest rate risk guidelines. Effective interest rate sensitivity management ensures that both assets and liabilities respond to changes in interest rates within an acceptable timeframe, thereby minimizing the effect of such interest rate movements on short- and long-term net interest margin and net interest income. 
 
 Financial simulation models are the primary tools used by the Asset/Liability Committee of the Bank s board of directors to measure interest rate exposure. Using a wide range of scenarios, management is provided with extensive information on the potential impact on net interest income caused by changes in interest rates. In these simulations, assumptions are made about the direction and volatility of interest rates, the slope of the yield curve and the changing composition of the Company s balance sheet resulting from both strategic plans and customer behavior. Simulation models also incorporate management s assumptions regarding such factors as loan and deposit growth, pricing, prepayment speeds and spreads between interest rates paid on deposits and charged on loans. Because of limitations inherent in any approach used to measure interest rate risk, simulation results are not intended as a forecast of the actual effect of a change in market interest rates on our results but rather as a means to better plan and execute appropriate asset-liability management strategies and manage our interest rate risk. 
 Assessing Short-Term Interest Rate Risk Net Interest Margin Simulation 
 
 On a quarterly basis, management simulates how changes in short- and long-term interest rates will impact future profitability, as reflected by changes in the Bank s net interest margin and net interest income. The tables below depict how, as of September 30, 2024, pre-tax net interest margin and net interest income are forecasted to change over timeframes of one year and two years under the six listed interest rate scenarios. The interest rate scenarios contemplate immediate and parallel shifts in short- and long-term interest rates.

ITEM 4.	CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Conclusion Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Bancshares maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in Bancshares reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to Bancshares management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. 
 
 Bancshares management carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of Bancshares disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Exchange Act) as of September 30, 2024, pursuant to the evaluation of these controls and procedures required by Rule 13a-15 of the Exchange Act. Based on that evaluation, Bancshares management concluded, as of September 30, 2024, that Bancshares disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level to ensure that the information required to be disclosed in Bancshares periodic filings with the SEC is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 There were no changes in Bancshares internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
