 appear in several different places in this Quarterly Report and, in some cases, can be identified by words such as anticipates , estimates , projects , expects , contemplates , intends , believes , plans , may , will or their negatives

We have based these forward-looking statements on our current expectations about future events on information that is available as of the date of
 this Quarterly Report, and any forward-looking statements made by us speak only as of the date on which they are made. While we believe these expectations are reasonable, such forward-looking statements are inherently subject to risks and
 uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control. Our actual future results may differ materially from those discussed or implied in our forward-looking statements for various reasons, including, our ability to change the direction of the
 Company; our ability to keep pace with new technology and changing market needs; our capital needs, and the competitive environment of our business. Additional Factors that could contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to:

general economic and business conditions, including changes in interest rates;

prices of other EVs, costs associated with manufacturing EVs and other economic conditions;

the effect of an outbreak of disease or similar public health threat, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, on the Company s business (natural phenomena, including the
 lingering effects of the COVID-19 pandemic);

the impact of political unrest, natural disasters or other crises, terrorist acts, acts of war and/or military operations, and our ability to maintain or broaden
 our business relationships and develop new relationships with strategic alliances, suppliers, customers, distributors or otherwise;

breaches in data security, failure of information security systems, cyber-attacks or other security or privacy-related incidents affecting us or our suppliers;

the ability of our information technology systems or information security systems to operate effectively;

actions by government authorities, including changes in government regulation;

uncertainties associated with legal proceedings;

changes in the size of the EV market;

future decisions by management in response to changing conditions;

inability to design, develop, market and sell new EVs and services that address additional market opportunities to generate revenue and positive cash flows;

dependency on certain key personnel and any inability to retain and attract qualified personnel;

inexperience in mass-producing EVs;

inability to succeed in establishing, maintaining and strengthening the Cenntro brand;

disruption of supply or shortage of raw materials;

the unavailability, reduction or elimination of government and economic incentives;

failure to manage future growth effectively; and

the other risks and uncertainties detailed from time to time in our filings with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission SEC ), including but not
 limited to those described under Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K as amended for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on April 1, 2024 (the Form 10-K ).

Although management has attempted to identify important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in
 forward-looking statements, there may be other factors that cause results not to be as anticipated, estimated or intended. There is no assurance that forward-looking statements will prove to be accurate, as actual results and future events could
 differ materially from those anticipated in such forward-looking statements. Accordingly, readers should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. These cautionary remarks expressly qualify, in their entirety, all forward-looking
 statements attributable to our Company or persons acting on our Company s behalf. We do not undertake to update any forward-looking statements to reflect actual results, changes in assumptions or changes in other factors affecting such
 statements, except as, and to the extent required by, applicable securities laws.

 under a contract dated August 23 2021. B-MOVILLE had already settled an amount of EUR by the end of 2022 and, therefore,
 still owed CAE an amount of EUR , of which EUR was owed by the end of 2022 under the instalment agreement. B-Moville had withheld instalment payments due to alleged defects of the vehicles, without specifying the amount of
 the claims for reduction of the purchase price. B-Moville had handed over the cars to its parent company SWOOPIN. SWOOPIN is insolvent and has been in judicial liquidation since November 2, 2022. The vehicles held by SWOOPIN were prevented from
 becoming part of the insolvency estate and being realized by the insolvency administrator. Due to the retention of title clause, the property of the 
 vehicles shall be reclaimed by CAE. In the meantime, SWOOPIN returned the vehicles to B-Moville. As of 14 May 2023, the insolvency court of Paris opened insolvency proceedings B-Moville. CAE has filed its claims in the insolvency proceedings.
 However, The liquidator has advised that there is no prospect of payment to unsecured creditors, including CAE, following its declaration of claims. The recovery of the outstanding amount owed to CAE is deemed highly unlikely. All Receivable of

 arbitrator and both parties are waiting for further proceedings under the arbitration process. On April 25, 2023, Tropos Technologies, Inc. filed a motion to dismiss the arbitration demand. On May 23, 2023, Shengzhou Machinery filed a response in
 opposition to the motion to dismiss the arbitration demand. On January 29, 2024, the arbitrator issued his opinion and order denying Tropos Motion to dismiss. Shengzhou requested motion to dismiss the arbitration without prejudice against Tropos, which was granted by

distribution partners of CAE. There, Sevic claims it acquired all IP rights to an electric vehicle, the so-called CITELEC model CITELEC ), fully and exclusively from the French company SH2M Sarl SH2M under Mr. Pierre Millet. Sevic claims
 these rights were acquired under a 2019 IP transfer agreement. According to Sevic, the METRO model METRO produced by Cenntro Electro Group Ltd. Cenntro and distributed by CAE derives directly from the CITELEC. The distribution of the METRO,
 therefore, allegedly infringes on Sevic s IP rights. In its action, Sevic relies on (Belgian) copyright law and unfair business practices. On February 2, 2023, the president of the commercial court of Brussels rendered a judgment, declaring i) the
 claim against Cedar was inadmissible and ii) The main claim against CAE and LEIE was founded. According to the president s opinion the CITELEC-model can enjoy copyright protection and determined it was sufficiently proven that Sevic acquired the
 copyrights of the CITELEC-model. The president then concluded that the distribution of the METRO-model in Belgium constituted a violation of article XI. 165 1 of the Belgian Code of Economic Law and thereby ordered the cessation of the
 distribution of the METRO-model, a penalty in the form of a fine of EUR per sold vehicle in Belgium and EUR for each other infringement in Belgium after the judgement was served with a maximum fine of EUR for LEIE and EUR fine for CAE. Because CAE
 has not sold any METRO-models in Belgium, the Company believes the judgement is incorrect but has accrued the related liability according to the judgement made. On April 17, 2023 CAE filed a writ of appeal. The introductory hearing was scheduled for May 22, 2023. The judge did not give any legal
 assessment at the hearing. All parties have been granted deadlines for written pleadings. The receipt of the final writ has been planned for September 2, 2024. As of now, it is not possible to determine what the outcome of these proceedings will

MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Introductory Note

Except as otherwise indicated by the context, references in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (this Form 10-Q to the Company, Cenntro, we, us or our are references to the combined
 business Cenntro Inc. and its subsidiaries. The following Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations MD A summarizes the significant factors affecting our results of operations, liquidity, capital
 resources and contractual obligations. The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the Company s unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere herein.

A. Key Components of Results of Operations

Net revenues

Up until December 31, 2021, we generate revenue primarily through the sale of ECVs to our channel partners. Starting in 2022, especially after the acquisition
 of CAE and the termination of the channel partners in North America, we have started to transform our go-to-market model to a more blended approach. Historically (i.e. up until end of 2021), these revenues were generated solely by the sale
 of the Metro . Starting from the last quarter of 2021, we began generating revenue from the sales of new ECV models, the Logistar 200, Logistar 210V, Logistar 100, Logistar 260, Teemak , Neibor 
 200, Avantier and Neibor 150 in Europe, Clubcar, Logistar 210 and Logistar 260 in Asia, Avantier and Logistar 400 in the US. Starting

 from 2024, we expect substantial increase in revenue from the US market as we shift our focus to the North American market sales and introduce additional new models for the US market.

Net revenues ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were generated from (a) vehicles sales, which primarily represent net revenues from sales of Metro vehicles (including
 vehicle kits), Logistar 200, Logistar 210, Logistar 210V, Logistar 260, Logistar 400, Antric , Avantier , Logistar 100, Neibor 150, Neibor 200 and Clubcar, (b) sales of ECV spare-parts related to our Metro vehicles, and (c) other
 sales, which primarily were: (i) the sales of inventory of outsourced ECV batteries and (ii) charges on services provided to channel partners for technical developments and assistance with vehicle homologation or certification.

Cost of goods sold

Cost of goods sold mainly consists of production-related costs including costs of raw materials, consumables, direct labor, overhead costs, depreciation of plants and
 equipment, manufacturing waste treatment processing fees and inventory write-downs. We incur cost of goods sold in relation to (i) vehicle sales and spare-part sales, including, among others, purchases of raw materials, labor costs, and
 manufacturing expenses that related to ECVs, and (ii) other sales, including cost and expenses that are not related to ECV sales.

Cost of goods sold also includes inventory write-downs. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. The cost of raw materials is determined on the
 basis of weighted average. The cost of finished goods is determined on the basis of weighted average and is comprised of direct materials, direct labor cost and an appropriate proportion of overhead. Net realizable value is based on estimated
 selling prices less selling expenses and any further costs of completion. Adjustments to reduce the cost of inventory to net realizable value are made, if required, for estimated excess, obsolescence, or impaired balances. Write-downs are
 recorded in the cost of goods sold in our statements of operations and comprehensive loss.

Operating expenses

Our operating expenses consist of general and administrative, selling and marketing expenses, and research and development expenses. General and administrative expenses are
 the most significant components of our operating expenses. Operating expenses also include provision for doubtful accounts.

Research and Development Expenses

Research and development expenses consist primarily of employee compensation and related expenses, prototype expenses, costs associated with assets acquired for research and development, product development costs,
 production inspection and testing expenses, product strategic advisory fees, third-party engineering and contractor support costs and allocated overhead. We will continue committing our resource in our research and development functions as we
 continue to invest in new ECV models, new materials and techniques, vehicle management and control systems, digital control capabilities and other related technologies.

Selling and Marketing Expenses

Selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of employee compensation and related expenses, sales commissions, marketing programs, freight costs, travel and
 entertainment expenses and allocated overhead. Marketing programs consist of advertising, tradeshows, events, corporate communications and brand-building activities. We expect our selling and marketing expenses to increase as we introduce our
 new ECV models, further develop additional local dealership and service support networks to augment our expanding sales globally.

Table of Contents 

General and Administrative Expenses

General and administrative expenses consist primarily of employee compensation and related expenses for administrative functions including finance, legal, human resources,
 and fees for third-party professional services. While we continue to monitor general and administrative expenses, we anticipate that our general and administrative expenses will not increase in 2024 as we committed to improve operational
 efficiency in the next two years, following rapid expansions in previous years.

Accounts receivable and allowance for credit losses

The Company adopted ASC 326 Financial Instruments Credit Losses using the modified retrospective approach through a cumulative-effect adjustment to accumulated deficit
 from January 1. 2023 and interim periods therein. Management used an expected credit loss model for the impairment of accounts receivable as of period ends. Management believes the aging of accounts receivable is a reasonable parameter to
 estimate expected credit loss, and determines expected credit losses for accounts receivables using an aging schedule as of period ends. The expected credit loss rates under each aging schedule were developed on basis of the average
 historical loss rates from previous years, and adjusted to reflect the effects of those differences in current conditions and forecasted changes. Management measured the expected credit losses of accounts receivable on a collective basis.
 When an accounts receivable does not share risk characteristics with other accounts receivables, management will evaluate such accounts receivable for expected credit loss on an individual basis. Doubtful accounts balances are written off and
 deducted from allowance. when receivables are deemed uncollectible. after all collection efforts have been exhausted and the potential for recovery is considered remote.

Impairment loss for long-lived assets

We evaluate the recoverability of long-lived assets or asset group with determinable useful lives whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset or a
 group of assets carrying amount may not be recoverable. We measure the carrying amount of long-lived asset against the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the assets or asset group and their eventual
 disposition. The carrying amount of the long-lived asset or asset group is not recoverable when the sum of the undiscounted expected future net cash flows is less than the carrying value of the asset being evaluated. Impairment loss is
 calculated as the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value. Fair value is generally determined by discounting the cash flows expected to be generated by the assets or asset group, when the market prices are not
 readily available. The adjusted carrying amount of the assets become new cost basis and are depreciated over the assets remaining useful lives. Long-lived assets are grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which
 identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities.

Other income (expenses)

Interest expense, net

Interest expense, net, consists of interest on outstanding loans and the convertible promissory notes.

Income(loss) from and impairment on equity method investments

Entities over which we have the ability to exercise significant influence but do not have a controlling interest through investment in common shares, or in-substance common
 shares, are accounted for using the equity method. Under the equity method, we initially record our investment at cost and subsequently recognize our proportionate share of each such entity s net income or loss after the date of investment
 into the statements of operations and comprehensive loss and accordingly adjust the carrying amount of the investment. When our share of losses in the equity of such entity equals or exceeds our interest in the equity of such entity, we do
 not recognize further losses, unless we have incurred obligations or made payments or guarantees on behalf of such entity. An impairment charge is recorded when the carrying amount of the investment exceeds its fair value and this condition
 is determined to be other-than-temporary. The adjusted carrying amount of the assets become new cost basis.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

Adjusted EBITDA for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023

In addition to our results determined in accordance with GAAP, we believe Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure is useful in evaluating operational performance. We use
 Adjusted EBITDA to evaluate ongoing operations and for internal planning and forecasting purposes. We believe that non-GAAP financial information, when taken collectively, may be helpful to investors in assessing operating performance.

Adjusted EBITDA is a supplemental measure of our performance that is not required by, or presented in accordance with, GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA is not a
 measurement of our financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net income or any other performance measure derived in accordance with GAAP. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (or net loss) before
 net interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization as further adjusted to exclude the impact of stock-based compensation expense and other non-recurring expenses including expenses related to TME Acquisition, expenses
 related to one-off payment inherited from the original Naked Brand Group, impairment of goodwill, convertible bond issuance fee, loss on redemption of convertible promissory notes, loss on exercise of warrants, and change in fair
 value of convertible promissory notes and derivative liability .

Table of Contents 

We present Adjusted EBITDA because we consider it to be an important supplemental measure of our performance and believe it is frequently used by securities analysts,
 investors, and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies in our industry. Management believes that investors understanding of our performance is enhanced by including this non-GAAP financial measure as a reasonable basis for
 comparing our ongoing results of operations. Management uses Adjusted EBITDA:

as a measurement of operating performance because it assists us in comparing the operating performance of our business on a consistent basis, as it removes the impact of items not directly resulting from our core operations;

for planning purposes, including the preparation of our internal annual operating budget and financial projections;

to evaluate the performance and effectiveness of our operational strategies; and

to evaluate our capacity to expand our business.

By providing this non-GAAP financial measure, together with the reconciliation, we believe we are enhancing investors understanding of our business and our results of operations, as well as
 assisting investors in evaluating how well we are executing our strategic initiatives. We caution investors that amounts presented in accordance with our definition of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similar measures disclosed by our
 competitors because not all companies and analysts calculate Adjusted EBITDA in the same manner. Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and should not be considered in isolation, or as an alternative to, or a substitute for net
 income or other financial statement data presented in our financial statements as indicators of financial performance. Some of the limitations are:

such measures do not reflect our cash expenditures;

such measures do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs;

although depreciation and amortization are recurring, non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future and such measures do not reflect any cash requirements for such
 replacements; and

the exclusion of stock-based compensation expense, which has been a significant recurring expense and will continue to constitute a significant recurring expense for the foreseeable future, as equity awards are expected to continue
 to be an important component of our compensation strategy.

Due to these limitations, Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as a measure of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business. We compensate for these limitations by
 relying primarily on our GAAP results and using these non-GAAP measures only supplementally. As noted in the table below, Adjusted EBITDA includes adjustments to exclude the impact of stock-based compensation expense and material infrequent
 items. It is reasonable to expect that these items will occur in future periods. However, we believe these adjustments are appropriate because the amounts recognized can vary significantly from period to period, do not directly relate to the
 ongoing operations of our business and may complicate comparisons of our internal operating results and operating results of other companies over time. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA may include adjustments for other items that we do not expect
 to regularly occur in future reporting periods. Each of the normal recurring adjustments and other adjustments described in this paragraph and in the reconciliation table below help management with a measure of our core operating performance
 over time by removing items that are not related to day-to-day operations.

The following table reconciles Adjusted EBITDA to the most directly comparable GAAP financial performance measure, which is net loss:

B. Liquidity and Capital Resources

We have historically funded working capital and other capital requirements primarily through bank loans, equity financings and short-term loans. Also, the reverse
 recapitalization we have completed at the end of December 2021 provided significant funding for the Company s operations. Cash is required primarily to purchase raw materials, repay debts and pay salaries, office expenses and other operating
 expenses.

As of September 30, 2024, we had approximately 21.8 million in cash and cash equivalents, approximately 4.6 million of accounts receivable. and approximately 35.9 million
 of inventory as compared to approximately 44.6 million in cash and cash equivalents, 4.6 million in accounts receivable, and 43.1 million in inventory as of September 30, 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, net
 cash used in operating activities was approximately 12.9 million and 45.6 million, respectively.

Short-Term Liquidity Requirements

We are looking at measures to generate operating efficiency as well as increasing the inventory turns in containing the growth of working capital for reducing
 negative net cash used in operating activities. With the cash improvement initiatives, we believe our cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient for us to continue to execute our business strategy over the twelve months period following
 the date of issuance of this 10Q. Our current business strategy for the next twelve months includes (i) the continued rollout of our new ECV models in North America and Europe, as applicable, (ii) the
 establishment of local assembly facilities in the United States and (iii) additional plants and equipment for the expansion of our Changxing factory 1 . Actual results could vary materially as a result of a number of factors, including: 

The costs of bringing our new facilities into operation;

The timing and costs involved in rolling out new ECV models to market;

Our ability to manage the costs of manufacturing our ECVs;

The costs of maintaining, expanding and protecting our intellectual property portfolio, including potential litigation costs and liabilities;

Revenues received from sales of our ECVs;

The costs of additional general and administrative personnel, including accounting and finance, legal and human resources, as well as costs related to litigation, investigations, or settlements;

Our ability to collect future revenues; and

Other risks discussed in the section titled Risk Factors . 

For the twelve months from the date hereof, we also plan to continue implementing measures to increase revenues and control operating costs and expenses, implementing
 comprehensive budget controls and operational assessments, implementing enhanced vendor review and selection processes as well as enhancing internal controls.

Long-Term Liquidity Requirements

In the long-term, we plan to regionalize the manufacturing and supply chain relating to certain components of our ECVs in the geographic markets in which our ECVs are sold.
 In the long-term, through our supply chain development know-how, we intend to establish supply chain relationships in North America and the European Union to support anticipated manufacturing and assembly needs in these markets, thereby
 reducing the time in transit and potentially other landed costs elements associated with importing our components and spare parts from China. Currently, the majority of our revenues is derived from the sale of ECVs by private label channel
 partners that assemble our vehicle kits in their own facilities. As part of our growth strategy, we plan to expand our channel partner network, and local assembly facilities to regionalize our manufacturing and supply chains to better serve
 our global customers especially to expand our after-sales-market services offerings.

We intend to further expand our technology through continued investment in research and development. Since inception in 2013 through September 30, 2024, we
 have spent over approximately 94.3 million in research and development activities related to our operations. We plan to increase our research and development expenditure over the long term as we build
 on our technologies in vehicle development, driving control, cloud-based platforms, and innovations for promoting sustainable energy. 

For our long-term business plan, we plan to fund current and future planned operations mainly through cash on hand, cash flow from operations, lines of credit and additional
 equity and debt financings to the extent available on commercially favorable terms.

Working Capital

As of September 30, 2024, our working capital was approximately 53.3 million, as compared to a working capital of approximately 75.6 million as of December 31, 2023. The
 approximately 22.3 million decrease in working capital during 2024 was primarily due to the decrease of cash and cash equivalents of approximately 7.6 million, the decrease of short-term investment of approximately 4.2 million, the
 decrease of accounts receivable of approximately 2.0 million, the decrease of inventories of 8.0 million, the increase of contractual liabilities of approximately 1.6 million, offset by the decrease of accounts payable of approximately
 0.6 million.

We have not entered into any off-balance sheet financial guarantees or other off-balance sheet commitments to guarantee the payment obligations of any third parties. We have

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
 of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated and combined financial statements, the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period and the related
 disclosures in the consolidated and combined financial statements and accompanying footnotes. Out of our significant accounting policies, which are described in Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of our consolidated and
 combined financial statements for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, included elsewhere in this Semi-annual Report, certain accounting policies are deemed critical, as they require management s
 highest degree of judgment, estimates and assumptions. While management believes its judgments, estimates and assumptions are reasonable, they are based on information presently available and actual results may differ significantly from
 those estimates under different assumptions and conditions. 

Basis of presentation

The accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2023, which has been derived from audited financial statements, and the unaudited condensed consolidated
 financial statements as of September 30, 2024 and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC ).

Certain information and disclosures, which are normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
 States of America U.S. GAAP ), have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations. Management believes that the disclosures made are adequate to provide a fair presentation. The interim financial information should be
 read in conjunction with the financial statements and the notes for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. The results of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 are not necessarily indicative of the results for the full
 year or any future periods.

Use of estimates

The preparation of the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires the Company to make estimates and assumptions that affect
 reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
 reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant accounting estimates reflected in the Company s unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include allowance for credit losses, lower of cost and net
 realizable value of inventories, impairment losses for long-lived assets and investments, valuation allowance for deferred tax assets and fair value of convertible promissory notes and warrants. Changes in facts and circumstances may result
 in revised estimates. The current economic environment has increased the degree of uncertainty inherent in those estimates and assumptions.

Fair value measurement

ASC 820 establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value. The hierarchy prioritizes the inputs into three levels based
 on the extent to which inputs used in measuring fair value are observable in the market. These tiers include:

Level 1 defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets;

Level 2 defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable; and

34 

Table of Contents 

Level 3 defined as unobservable inputs for which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions.

The Company s financial instruments not reported at fair value primarily consist of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts receivable, prepayments and other
 current assets, amount due from and due to related parties, accounts payable and accrued expenses and other current liabilities.

The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts receivable and other current assets, accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current
 liabilities and amount due from and due to related party, current were approximate fair value because of the short-term nature of these items. The estimated fair values of loan from third party, and amount due from related party, non-current
 were not materially different from their carrying value as presented due to the brief maturities and because the interest rates on these borrowings approximate those that would have been available for loans of similar remaining maturities and
 risk profiles.

Available-for-sale investments and currency-cross swap were classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy because they were valued using quoted prices in active
 markets. Our debt security investments are classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. As the Issuer is not yet listed and there are no similar companies in the market at the same stage of development for comparison, the Issuer is
 difficult to value, and the valuation is not considered reliable. Therefore, the Company develop own assumption by future cash flow forecast, which contains principle paid and interests accrued.

The fair value option provides an election that allows a company to irrevocably elect to record certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value on an
 instrument-by-instrument basis at initial recognition. The Company has elected to apply the fair value option to: i) convertible promissory notes payable due to the complexity of the various conversion and settlement options available to
 notes holders; ii) convertible loan receivable, which was recognized as debt security in long-term investments, and iii) currency-cross swap, which was recognized as derivative financial instruments in short-term investments.

The convertible promissory notes payable accounted for under the fair value option election are each a debt host financial instrument containing embedded features that would
 otherwise be required to be bifurcated from the debt-host and recognized as separate derivative liabilities subject to initial and subsequent periodic estimated fair value measurements in accordance with GAAP. Notwithstanding, when the fair
 value option election is applied to financial liabilities, bifurcation of an embedded derivative is not required, and the financial liability is initially measured at its issue-date estimated fair value and then subsequently remeasured at
 estimated fair value on a recurring basis as of each reporting period date.

The portion of the change in fair value attributed to a change in the instrument-specific credit risk is recognized as a component of other comprehensive income and the
 remaining amount of the fair value adjustment is recognized as changes in fair value of convertible promissory notes and derivative liabilities in the Company s consolidated statement of operations. The estimated fair value adjustment is
 presented in a respective single line item within other expense in the consolidated statement of operations because the change in fair value of the convertible notes was not attributable to instrument-specific credit risk.

In connection with the issuances of convertible promissory notes, the Company issued investor warrants and placement agent warrants to purchase common stock of the Company.
 The Company utilizes a Binomial model to estimate the fair value of the warrants and are considered a Level 3 fair value measurement. The warrants are measured at each reporting period, with changes in fair value recognized in the statement
 of operations.

As a practical expedient, the Company uses Net Asset Value NAV or its equivalent to measure the fair value of its certain fund investment. The Company s investments valued
 at NAV as a practical expedient are: i) private equity funds, which represent the investment in equity securities on the condensed consolidated balance sheet; ii) wealth management products purchased from banks, which represents the
 available-for-sale investments in short-term investments on the condensed consolidated balance sheet.

Revenue recognition

The Company recognizes revenue when goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration which it expects to receive in exchange for
 those goods or services. In determining when and how revenue is recognized from contracts with customers, the Company performs the following five-step analysis: (i) identification of a contract with the customer (ii) determination of
 performance obligations (iii) measurement of the transaction price (iv) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations and (v) recognition of revenue when (or as) the Company satisfies each performance obligation.

35 

Table of Contents 

The Company generates revenue primarily through sales of light-duty ECVs, sales of ECV parts, and sales of off-road electric vehicles. Revenue is recognized at a point in time
 once the Company has determined that the customer has obtained control over the product. Revenue is recognized net of return allowance and any taxes collected from customers, which are subsequently remitted to governmental authorities.
 Significant judgement is required to estimate return allowances. The Company reasonably estimate the possibility of return based on the historical experience, changes in judgments on these assumptions and estimates could materially impact the
 amount of net revenues recognized.

Shipping and handling costs for product shipments occur prior to the customer obtaining control of the goods are accounted for as fulfilment costs rather than separate
 performance obligations and recorded as sales and marketing expenses.

The following table disaggregates the Company s revenues by product line for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:

Contract Balances 

Timing of revenue recognition was once the Company has determined that the customer has obtained control over the product. Accounts receivable represent revenue recognized for
 the amounts invoiced and/or prior to invoicing when the Company has satisfied its performance obligation and has an unconditional right to the payment.

Contractual liabilities primarily represent the Company s obligation to transfer additional goods or services to a customer for which the Company has received consideration.
 The consideration received remains a contractual liability until goods or services have been provided to the customer. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recognized 946,071 and 484,477 revenue that was
 included in contractual liabilities as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM 1. 

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

The Company may be involved in various legal proceedings, claims and other disputes arising from the commercial operations, projects, employees
 and other matters which, in general, are subject to uncertainties and in which the outcomes are not predictable. The Company determines whether an estimated loss from a contingency should be accrued by assessing whether a loss is deemed probable
 and can be reasonably estimated. Although the outcomes of these legal proceedings cannot be predicted, the Company does not believe these actions, in the aggregate, will have a material adverse impact on its financial position, results of
 operations or liquidity. Please refer to the description as contained in Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data on page F-1 of our Annual Report and the information described below.

CAE filed an action in Landgericht Bochum, a county court in Bochum, Germany against Delivrium s.r.o., a Czech Republic company Delivrium for a
 claim arising from a purchase contract by and between Delivrium and CAE for a dispute of 956,760 under which CAE is requesting payment and acceptance of vehicles previously ordered by Delivrium. As of the date of this quarterly report, CAE is
 waiting for a statement or notification from the court in Louny (Czech Republic). Because CAE could not deliver the claim to Delivrium in Germany, ,CAE has filed action in the District Court of Louny, Czech Republic.

In June 2022, Sevic Systems SE Sevic filed for injunctive relief in a corporate court in Brussels, Belgium, where Servic alleged CAE infringed on
 Sevic s intellectual property IP rights. The injunctive action was also directed against LEIE Center SRL LEIE and Cedar Europe GmbH Cedar ), two of CAEs distribution partners. Sevic alleges to it acquired IP rights to the CITELEC
 electric vehicle model CITELEC ), fully and exclusively from a French company SH2M Sarl( SH2M ). Sevic alleges these IP rights were acquired through an IP transfer agreement in 2019. According to Sevic, the METRO model METRO produced by
 Cenntro Electro Group Ltd. Cenntro and distributed by CAE, derives directly from the CITELEC. Thus, Sevic allegedly believes the distribution of the METRO, infringes on Sevic s IP rights. In Sevic s action, Sevic relies on (Belgian) copyright
 law and unfair business practices. On February 2, 2023, the president of the commercial court of Brussels (the President rendered a judgment, declaring i) the claim against Cedar was inadmissible and ii) the claim against CAE and LEIE was
 founded. According to the President s opinion, it was determined that the CITELEC-model can enjoy copyright protection, and it was proven that Sevic acquired the copyrights of the CITELEC-model. The President then concluded that the distribution
 of the METRO-model in Belgium constituted a violation of article XI. 165 1 of the Belgian Code of Economic Law and thereby ordered the cessation of the distribution of the METRO-model, a penalty in the form of a fine of EUR20,000.00 per sold
 vehicle in Belgium and EUR5,000.00 for each other infringement in Belgium after the judgement was served with a maximum fine of EUR500,000.00 for LEIE and EUR1,000,000.00 fine for CAE. Because CAE has not sold any METRO-models in Belgium, the
 Company believes the judgement is incorrect but has accrued the related liability according to the judgement made. On April 17,2023 CAE filed a writ of appeal. The introductory hearing was scheduled for May 22, 2023, and the judge overseeing the
 hearing did not give any legal assessment at the hearing. All parties have been granted deadlines for written pleadings. The final writ was received on September 2, 2024. As of the date of this quarterly report, we expect the oral hearing will
 take place in 2025, however it is not possible to determine the outcome of these proceedings related to Sevic.
