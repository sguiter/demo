 Item 1C. Cybersecurity 
 
 We recognize the critical importance of developing, implementing, and maintaining robust cybersecurity measures to safeguard our information systems and protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of our data.

We only use third party software for accounting, billing and payroll that has robust compliance and is actively involved in continuous assessment of risks from cybersecurity threats, including prevention, mitigation, detection, and remediation of cybersecurity incidents. 
 
 Our CEO is responsible for overseeing our business operations and is responsible for day-to-day assessment and confers weekly with subsidiary webmaster to understand any risks from cybersecurity threats, including the prevention, mitigation, detection, and remediation of cybersecurity incidents. 
 
 As our core operations are virtual, it is routine to undertake activities to prevent, detect, and minimize the effects of cybersecurity incidents, maintain business continuity, contingency, and have recovery plans for use in the event of a cybersecurity incident by the administering of local and cloud based back up of files and emails. We currently do not carry a cyber liability insurance policy but are evaluating whether to acquire one to mitigate any financial impact of a cybersecurity breach.

Revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024, decreased 27 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. Cost of revenues as a percentage of sales decreased 30 between the periods. The decrease in revenues is primarily a result of the significant increase in competition for market share in the cannabis tele-medicine industry. This decrease in the demand for our service continued during the third quarter of 2024.

Revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, decreased 31 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Cost of revenues as a percentage of sales decreased 23 between the periods. The decrease in revenues is primarily a result of the significant increase in competition for market share in the cannabis tele-medicine industry. This decrease in the demand for our service continued during the third quarter of 2024. 
 
 Total operating expenses decreased in September 30, 2024 compared with 2023 which trended down as did revenue in the current period. Decreases in depreciation and amortization, wages and salaries and general and administrative expenses. PrestoDoctor management salaries also decreased in the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 Cash used in operating activities was 78,400 in the nine months ended September 30,2024. We ended the third quarter of 2024 with 41,352 in cash on hand. 
 
 The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and the liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. We incurred net losses of 854,454 and 995,109, respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023 and had an accumulated deficit of 82,895,826 as of September 30, 2024. The Company may seek to raise money for working capital purposes through a public offering of its equity capital or through a private placement of equity capital or convertible debt. It will be important for the Company to be successful in its efforts to raise capital in this manner if it is going to be able to further its business plan in an aggressive manner. Raising capital in this manner will cause dilution to current shareholders. 
 
 The amount of cash on hand the Company has does not provide sufficient liquidity to meet the immediate needs of our current operations.

 Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 Conclusions of Management Regarding Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 At the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, an evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s management, including the Chief Executive Officer CEO and Chief Financial Officer CFO ), of the effectiveness of the design and operations of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a 15(e) and Rule 15d 15(e) under the Exchange Act). Based on that evaluation, the CEO and the CFO have concluded that as of the end of the period covered by this report, the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as it was determined that there were material weaknesses affecting our disclosure controls and procedures. 
 
 Management of the Company believes that these material weaknesses are due to the small size of the company s accounting staff. The small size of the Company s accounting staff may prevent adequate controls in the future, such as segregation of duties, due to the cost/benefit of remediation. To mitigate the current limited resources and limited employees, we rely heavily on direct management oversight of transactions, along with the use of external legal and accounting 
 6 
 
 professionals. As the Company grows, management expects to increase the number of employees, which will enable us to implement adequate segregation of duties within the internal control framework. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended June 30, 2024, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
