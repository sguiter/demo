 Going Concern 
 We have incurred significant net losses and negative operating cash flows since our inception, and we expect to continue to incur net losses and negative operating cash flow, in part due to the negative impact on our operations by customer terminations. As of September 30, 2024, our total cash was million and we had working capital of approximately million. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our average monthly cash burn rate from operations was million. 
 
 On August 13, 2024, the Company entered into an agreement with Acuitas Capital LLC Acuitas Capital and together with its affiliates, Acuitas pursuant to which Acuitas agreed to purchase Committed Demand Notes (as defined in Note 10 below) in the original principal amount of million in accordance with a schedule specified therein, subject to a limited offset right, and not to exercise its right to require that any amounts due under any Demand Note (as defined in Note 10 below) be paid until after August 30, 2025, subject to a limited exception. As of September 30, 2024, Committed Demand Notes with an aggregate principal amount of million have been issued by the Company and purchased by Acuitas. In October 2024, Acuitas

 (unaudited) 

 million. See Note 14 below. As of the filing date of this report, Acuitas has not purchased the remaining million in principal amount that was to be purchased no later than November 1, 2024. In addition, Acuitas may, in its sole discretion, elect to purchase up to an additional million in principal amount of Demand Notes under the Keep Well Agreement (as defined in Note 10 below). Management is in active discussion with Acuitas with respect to the purchase of the remaining million in principal amount of Committed Demand Notes and some or all of the additional million in principal amount of Demand Notes. The Company cannot predict if or when Acuitas will purchase the remaining million in principal amount of Committed Demand Notes or will elect to purchase some or all of the additional million in principal amount of Demand Notes. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, million of secured debt, including accrued paid-in-kind interest, issued under the Keep Well Agreement was outstanding. As of the filing date of this report, approximately million of secured debt, including accrued paid-in-kind interest, issued under the Keep Well Agreement was outstanding, million of which is represented by Demand Notes (including Committed Demand Notes) payable at any time after August 30, 2025 upon demand of the holder (see Note 10 below for more information) and the balance of which matures on May 14, 2026, unless it becomes due and payable in full earlier, whether by acceleration or otherwise. 
 
 In October 2024, the Company received a total of million of cash proceeds from the exercise of warrants the Company issued in its public offering consummated in November 2023. See Note 14 below. Assuming the exercise in full of the warrants the Company issued in such public offering at their current exercise price and that the exercise price is paid in cash, the Company would receive gross proceeds of approximately million. There can be no assurance that all or any portion of such warrants will be exercised. 
 
 Management is actively pursuing execution of the Company s growth strategy and has been engaged in discussions with prospects in its sales pipeline, two of which are in or near the final proposal and approval phase, as well as in discussions with existing customers to expand their business relationship with the Company. There can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in any of these endeavors. 
 Management plans to continue executing its strategy to increase liquidity by continuing to (i) explore other sources of capital for future liquidity needs; (ii) manage operating costs by strategically pursuing cost optimization initiatives; and (iii) pursue executing our growth strategy by: (a) expanding sales and marketing resources to acquire new and diverse customers across major health plans, value based provider groups and self-insurance employers; (b) executing on our better market penetration strategy by providing full scale customized behavioral health solutions, addressing customer needs across all member acuity levels while mitigating vendor fatigue by becoming a principal customer partner; (c) leveraging our AI technology and new predictive algorithms to improve identification and outreach, create more efficiencies, enhance coaching solutions and create more proof points; and (d) opportunistically pursuing partnerships that we believe will accelerate growth. 
 
 We will need additional capital to successfully execute our growth strategy. In addition to revenue from business operations, since April 2022, the Company's primary source of working capital has been borrowings under the Keep Well Agreement and raising capital in equity offerings. We may seek to raise additional capital through equity or debt financings, however, when we can affect such financings and how much capital we can raise depends on a variety of factors, including, among others, market conditions, the trading price of our common stock and our determination as to the appropriate sources of funding for our operations. There can be no assurance that other capital will be available when needed or that, if available, it will be obtained on terms favorable to us and our stockholders, that we will be successful in implementing cost optimization initiatives, or that we will be successful in executing our growth strategy. In addition, the Keep Well Agreement contains various financial and other covenants, and any non-compliance with those covenants could result in an acceleration of the repayment of the amounts outstanding thereunder. Furthermore, equity or debt financings may have a dilutive effect on the holdings of our existing stockholders, and debt financings may subject us to restrictive covenants, operational restrictions and security interests in our assets. 
 
 Based on the Company's current analysis of the conditions described above and the Company's forecast of its future operating results, the Company does not believe that its cash on hand and other sources of capital will be sufficient to allow the Company to meet its obligations as they come due and to continue its operating activities for at least the next 12 months from the date the financial statements in this report are released. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

 Preferred Stock 
 
 In 2020, the Company completed the issuance of a total of shares of Series A Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock (the "Series A Preferred Stock"). The Company, generally, may not redeem the Series A Preferred Stock until August 25, 2025, except upon the occurrence of a Delisting Event or Change of Control (as defined in the Certificate of Designations establishing the Series A Preferred Stock), and on and after August 25, 2025, the Company may, at its option, redeem the Series A Preferred Stock, in whole, at any time, or in part, from time to time, for cash at a redemption price of per share, plus any accrued and unpaid dividends. The Series A Preferred Stock has no maturity date and will remain outstanding indefinitely unless redeemed by the Company or exchanged for shares of common stock in connection with a Delisting Event or Change of Control. Holders of Series A Preferred Stock generally have no voting rights, but have limited voting rights if the Company fails to pay dividends in respect of the Series A Preferred Stock for six or more quarters, whether or not declared or consecutive and in certain other events, including the right, voting separately as a single class, to elect individuals to the Company's Board of Directors. Such director election right commenced on August 31, 2023 since the Company did not pay the dividend payable on that date or in respect of the five prior quarters. 
 
 Holders of Series A Preferred Stock of record at the close of business of each respective record date for quarterly dividends (February 15, May 15, August 15 and November 15 of each year) are entitled to receive, when, as and if declared by our board of directors, out of funds legally available for the payment of dividends, cumulative cash dividends at the rate of per annum of the per share liquidation preference (equivalent to per annum per share or per quarter per share).

On November 20, 2023, The Nasdaq Stock Market filed a Form 25-NSE with the SEC to remove the Series A Preferred Stock from listing and registration on The Nasdaq Stock Market. The Series A Preferred Stock currently trades in the over-the-counter OTC Markets system.

 Increase in Warrant Coverage and Other Adjustments 
 
 Following approval of the Company s stockholders obtained at the 2023 Special Meeting, (a) the exercise price of the warrants issued under the Keep Well Agreement (both the Original Keep Well Warrants outstanding as of the date of the Second Amendment and those issued thereafter) was reduced to per share per share as adjusted for the 2023 Reverse Stock Split), which was the Nasdaq Official Closing Price (as reflected on Nasdaq.com) of the Company s common stock immediately preceding the time the parties entered into the Second Amendment, and which is subject to future adjustment as described below; (b) the number of shares of the Company s common stock subject to the warrants outstanding at the time of the 2023 Special Meeting (i.e., shares, before the 2023 Reverse Stock Split) was increased to the number of shares that would have been subject to such warrants if the warrant coverage was equal to of the amount borrowed under the Keep Well Agreement in respect of which the applicable Keep Well Warrant was issued (instead of divided by (i.e., shares, or an additional shares; shares , or an additional shares, as adjusted for the 2023 Reverse Stock Split); and (c) the warrant coverage on borrowings under the Keep Well Agreement after the date of the Second Amendment was increased to a number of shares of the Company s common stock equal to (x) of the amount borrowed (instead of of such amount) divided by (y) the greater of (i) the per share warrant exercise price (as adjusted as of the date of issuance of the applicable warrant) and (ii) as adjusted for the 2023 Reverse Stock Split) (the Warrant Coverage Denominator ), subject to future adjustment as described below, and each warrant issued after the date of the Second Amendment has an exercise price equal to per share per share as adjusted for the 2023 Reverse Stock Split), subject to future adjustment as described below.

The Company refers to the new warrants issued in exchange for outstanding warrants and to any warrants issued in connection with future borrowings under the Keep Well Agreement or in connection with the conversion of the principal amount of any Keep Well Note and/or accrued interest thereon into shares of the Company s common stock as the Keep Well Warrants. 
 
 Under the terms of the Second Amendment, if the reverse stock split approved at the 2023 Special Meeting is effected, then: 
 
 (1) the exercise price of each warrant issued pursuant to the Keep Well Agreement that is outstanding as of the effective time of the reverse stock split would be reduced to the lesser of (i) the volume-weighted average price of the Company s common stock over the five trading days beginning on the trading day that commences immediately after the effective time of the reverse stock split (the Reverse Stock Split Price and (ii) the exercise price after giving effect to the adjustment thereto as a result of the reverse stock split (the lesser of (i) and (ii), the Post-Stock Split Price ), subject to further reduction as described below; and

 As discussed in Note 7 above, the reverse stock split approved at the 2023 Special Meeting was effected on July 27, 2023. After giving effect to such reverse stock split, and in accordance with the above, the Post-Stock Split Price was determined to be on August 3, 2023. In addition, after giving effect to such reverse stock split, the number of shares of the Company s common stock underlying the Keep Well Warrants outstanding at the effective time of the reverse stock split were proportionally adjusted such that the aggregate exercise price payable upon exercise of the Keep Well Warrants remains unchanged. 
 
 Also under the terms of the Second Amendment: (i) the exercise price of each Keep Well Warrant outstanding as of September 1, 2023 was to be reduced to the closing price of the Company s common stock on August 31, 2023, if such closing price is less

As such, on September 1, 2023, the exercise price of each Keep Well Warrant and the Warrant Coverage Denominator (applicable to warrant issuances, if any, thereafter) was determined to be . 
 
 In February 2023, as a result of approvals obtained at the 2023 Special Meeting relating to the terms provided for in the Second Amendment, as described above, the Company determined that terms of the Keep Well Agreement as amended by the Second Amendment is substantially different from the terms in the Original Keep Well Agreement and that extinguishment of the senior secured notes issued under the Original Keep Well Agreement and recognition of a new debt instrument for the senior secured notes under the Original Keep Well Agreement as amended by the Second Amendment was appropriate. As such, in February 2023, the Company recorded the extinguishment of the senior secured notes under the Original Keep Well Agreement, resulting in a loss on extinguishment of debt of million, which was recorded as part of additional paid in capital since the debt transaction is with Acuitas, a significant shareholder. The new debt instrument includes an embedded conversion feature, as described above, which was accounted for in accordance with ASU 2020-06, Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity's Own Equity, which the Company adopted on January 1, 2022, and accordingly the Company did not separately present such embedded conversion feature in equity but rather accounted for the convertible debt wholly as debt. The Company also assessed and determined that the Keep Well Warrants qualified for equity classification and applied the relative fair value method to allocate proceeds from the debt issuance to the Keep Well Warrants. The Company incurred million of debt issuance costs related to the Second Amendment. The fair value of the Keep Well Warrants and new debt issuance costs relating to the Second Amendment were recorded as part of debt discount and accreted using the effective interest method over the contractual term of the debt.

 Public Offering, Private Placement and Notes Conversion 
 
 On November 14, 2023, the Company completed a public offering (the Public Offering ). In the Public Offering, the Company issued (a) shares of its common stock and warrants to purchase up to shares of its common stock at a combined public offering price of per share of common stock and accompanying warrants (the Public Offering Price ), and (b) pre-funded warrants to purchase up to shares of its common stock (the Public Offering Pre-Funded Warrants and warrants to purchase up to shares of its common stock at a combined public offering price of per Public Offering Pre-Funded Warrant and accompanying warrants, which represents the per share public offering price for the common stock and accompanying warrants less the per share exercise price for each Public Offering Pre-Funded Warrant. The Company refers to the warrants sold in the Public Offering accompanying the shares of common stock and the warrants accompanying the Public Offering Pre-Funded Warrants as the Public Offering Warrants. The Company received gross proceeds of million from the Public Offering, and therefore the Public Offering constituted a Qualified Financing. Total net proceeds was approximately million (net of approximately million of offering related fees and expenses, not including the placement fee payable relating to the Private Placement discussed below). The Public Offering Warrants had an initial exercise price of per share, subject to adjustment. The exercisability of the Public Offering Warrants was subject to the effectiveness of the Fifth Amendment Stockholder Approval Matters, and expire from the effectiveness thereof. 
 
 In accordance with the Fifth Amendment, concurrent with the closing of the Public Offering, the Company issued to Humanitario Capital LLC, an affiliate of Acuitas Capital, a Private Placement Pre-Funded Warrant to purchase up to shares of the Company's common stock, at an exercise price of per share, and a Private Placement Warrant to purchase up to shares of the Company's common stock, at an exercise price of per share, subject to adjustment, for total consideration of million. The consideration for the Private Placement Securities consisted of (a) the million in the Escrow Account that Acuitas previously delivered to the Company in June 2023 and September 2023 in accordance with the Keep Well Agreement (which million was reclassified from restricted cash to unrestricted cash) and (b) million of debt owed

 (unaudited) 

 million of debt discount in connection with million Keep Well Notes cancelled. The Company paid placement fees of approximately million in connection with the Private Placement. 
 
 The Company assessed and determined that the warrants issued in the Public Offering and Private Placement as described above qualified for equity classification and applied the relative fair value method to allocate proceeds from each Public Offering and Private Placement transactions to the respective warrants. 
 
 In accordance with the Fifth Amendment, on November 14, 2023 and before the closing of the Public Offering and Private Placement, the Notes Conversion was effected. In connection with the Notes Conversion, million of Keep Well Notes were converted into shares of the Company s common stock and the Company issued to Acuitas a Conversion Warrant to purchase up to shares of the Company s common stock with an exercise price of per share, which was the conversion price of the Keep Well Notes converted in the Notes Conversion. The Company wrote-off million of debt discount in connection with the conversion of million of Keep Well Notes.

The Company filed an information statement regarding the Fifth Amendment Stockholder Approval Matters with the SEC on November 30, 2023 and mailed such information statement to the holders of its common stock. The actions approved by such consent became effective on December 20, 2023. 
 
 Because the Public Offering Price was less than the conversion price at which Keep Well Notes were converted in the Notes Conversion, in December 2023 (1) the Company issued to Acuitas additional shares of common stock, which when added with the shares of common stock issued in respect of the Notes Conversion, equaled the total number of shares of common stock that the Company would have issued in respect of the Notes Conversion if the Keep Well Notes converted in the Notes Conversion were converted at a conversion price equal to the Public Offering Price; and (2) the exercise price of the Conversion Warrant was reduced to the Public Offering Price and the number of shares of common stock subject to the Conversion Warrant was increased by an additional shares to equal the number of shares of common stock that would have been subject to the Conversion Warrant if the Keep Well Notes converted in the Notes Conversion were converted at a conversion price equal to the Public Offering Price. 
 
 Sixth Amendment and August 2024 Amendment

The Company refers to the Sixth Amendment Notes, including the Committed Demand Notes, as the Demand Notes. To the extent the Company receives proceeds from a capital contribution or the issuance of any capital stock on or after August 13, 2024 and on or before November 1, 2024, in its sole discretion, Acuitas has the right to elect to reduce the amount of Committed Demand Notes to be purchased on a dollar-for-dollar basis (the Offset Right ). Under the August 2024 Amendment, Acuitas also agreed not to exercise its right to require that any amounts due under any Demand Note be paid until after August 30, 2025. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Acuitas has purchased all million of the Committed Demand Notes, less any amounts not purchased pursuant to its exercise of the Offset Right, and the Company receives any proceeds from a capital contribution or the issuance of any capital stock after November 1, 2024, Acuitas, in its sole discretion, may require that the net proceeds therefrom be applied to pay any amounts due under the Committed Demand Notes. The terms of the Demand Notes are substantially similar to the Surviving Note, except the amounts due under the Demand Notes are payable upon demand of the holder at any time after August 30, 2025. 
 
 The Company issued and sold Demand Notes to Acuitas in the original principal amount of million on each of April 5, 2024, May 8, 2024, June 5, 2024 and August 28, 2024, and million on September 30, 2024.

Our performance obligation is generally satisfied over the length of the Ontrak program as our services our delivered and in certain contractual arrangement that provides for a minimum guarantee at the end of a contractual term upon non-achievement of stipulated revenue targets, revenue for the minimum guarantee is recognized when our performance obligation is satisfied at a point in time. 
 Cash flow from operations. Our business activities generally have resulted in an outflow of cash flow from operations as we invest strategically into our business to help the growth of our operations.

 _________ 
 (1) Represents the number of health plan members eligible for our Ontrak Engage program, one of the segmented solutions of WholeHealth+. We began offering the Ontrak Engage program on an la carte basis in the first half of 2024. A detailed description of our solutions is available in Part I, Item 1 of our 2023 10-K. 
 
 Our revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 2.6 million compared to 3.7 million for the same period in 2023, and 7.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 9.2 million for the same period in 2023. The decrease in our revenue in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods in 2023 was primarily attributable to a decrease in revenue related to the health plan customer informing us in October 2023 of its intent not to continue using our services after February 2024, partially offset by an increase in commercial revenue related to the expansion with an existing health plan customer. 
 
 Our cash flow from operations for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was (1.4) million compared to (1.8) million for the same period in 2023, and (9.1) million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to (11.9) million for the same period in 2023. The improvement in our cash flow from operations during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023 was primarily due to an improvement in operating expenses resulting from strategic headcount reductions in March 2023 and February 2024 as well as cost optimization initiatives we implemented. 
 39 

Our callable outreach pool for the WholeHealth+ program was 6,689 at September 30, 2024 compared to 9,377 at September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily related to a health plan customer informing us in October 2023 of its intent not to continue using our services after February 2024, partially offset by an increase in our callable outreach pool related to the expansion of our program to a larger commercial population with a health plan customer, one of the largest health systems in the U.S. Mid-Atlantic and Southeast and a continuing expansion of our strategic partnership with the same health plan customer to offer our program to eligible self-insured groups. Also, in May 2024, we announced the launch of a new customer agreement with a prominent regional Medicaid health plan for our Wholehealth+ and Ontrak Engage and Ontrak Access solutions upon obtainment of state approval. In August 2024, we announced the signing of a new customer agreement with a large, regional health plan in the Northeast, for whom we began proving our WholeHealth+ solution in October 2024 to its members in New York as well as our Engage solution to its members who are not eligible for WholeHealth+ but would benefit from ongoing care coaching to help them address physical and behavioral health challenges and social needs without the need for provider intervention. As we work with our remaining customers in maximizing return on their investment, optimizing our enrollment process and enhancing our offering, the callable outreach pool could continue to fluctuate in the near term. 
 
 In the first half of 2024, we began offering the Ontrak Engage program, one of the segmented solutions of WholeHealth+, on an la carte basis. Our callable outreach pool for the Ontrak Engage program was 498 at September 30, 2024. 
 
 Key Components of Our Results of Operations 
 Revenue 
 
 We generate revenues from the services we provide to populations insured by private health insurance programs, including employer funded programs (which we refer to as commercial revenue) and by government-funded health insurance programs, such as managed Medicare Advantage, managed Medicaid and dual eligible (Medicare and Medicaid) populations. We aim to increase the number of members that are eligible for our solutions by signing new contracts and identifying more eligible members within customers with whom we have existing contracts. 
 
 Revenue from contracts with customers is recognized when, or as, we satisfy our performance obligations by transferring the promised goods or services to the customers. Revenue from a performance obligation satisfied over time is recognized by measuring our progress in satisfying the performance obligation in a manner that depicts the transfer of the goods or services to the customer. Revenue related to health plan customers whose health plan members are enrolled in our program is recognized over the enrollment period of the program. 
 
 One of our customer s contract includes a minimum guarantee of aggregate invoices, at agreed upon rates, of 5.8 million over a two year contractual period ending on December 31, 2024, of which we have invoiced 2.0 million as of September 30, 2024, leaving 3.8 million of minimum guarantee over the remaining contractual period. In the event the minimum guarantee is not achieved, the shortfall will be invoiced to the customer on December 31, 2024, at which time revenue will be evaluated for recognition. 
 
 Cost of Revenue 
 
 Cost of revenue consists primarily of salaries related to our care coaches, member engagement specialists and other staff directly involved in member care, healthcare provider claims payments and related processing fees, and other direct costs incurred to serve our health plan customers. All costs are recognized in the period in which an eligible member receives services. 
 Operating Expenses 
 
 Our operating expenses consist of our sales and marketing, research and development, and general and administrative expenses, as well as restructuring, severance and related costs as applicable. Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel and related expenses for our sales and marketing staff, including salaries, benefits, bonuses, stock-based compensation and commissions, and costs of marketing and promotional events, corporate communications, online marketing, product marketing and other brand-building activities. All advertising related costs are expensed as incurred. Research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel and related expenses for our engineers and software development staff, including salaries, benefits, bonuses and stock-based compensation, and the cost of certain third-party service providers. Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. General and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel and related expenses for administrative, legal, finance, compliance and human resource staff, including salaries, benefits, bonuses and stock-based 
 40 

compensation, professional fees, insurance premiums, and other corporate expenses. Restructuring, severance and related costs include workforce reduction costs and asset impairment charges, if any. 
 
 Interest Expense, net 
 
 Interest expense consists primarily of interest expense from our outstanding debt, accretion of debt discount, amortization of debt issuance costs and finance leases. 
 
 Other Income (Expense), net 
 
 Other income (expense), net consists of gains and losses associated with changes in fair value of warrant liabilities and contingent consideration, write-off of debt issuance related costs and other assets, net gain related to the write-off of an operating lease asset and liability upon early termination of the lease, and other miscellaneous income and expense items.

 Revenue 
 The mix of our revenue between commercial revenue and government revenue can fluctuate quarter over quarter. The following table sets forth our sources of revenue for each of the periods indicated:

Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, (In thousands, except percentages) 2024 2023 Change Change 2024 2023 Change Change Commercial revenue 777 1,216 (439) (36) 2,567 3,133 (566) (18) Percentage of commercial revenue to total revenue 30 33 (3) 33 34 (1) Government revenue 1,792 2,499 (707) (28) 5,133 6,071 (938) (15) Percentage of government revenue to total revenue 70 67 3 67 66 1 Total revenue 2,569 3,715 (1,146) (31) 7,700 9,204 (1,504) (16) 
 
 Total revenue decreased 1.1 million, or 31 , in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period of 2023, and decreased 1.5 million, or 16 , in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period of 2023. 
 
 The percentage of our commercial revenue to total revenue decreased to 30 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 33 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, and the percentage of our government revenue increased to 70 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 67 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The percentage of our commercial revenue decreased to 33 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 34 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, and the percentage of our government revenue increased to 67 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 66 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in commercial revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods last year was primarily related to a health plan customer who gave notice in October 2023 of its intent not to continue using our services after February 2024, partially offset by an increase in commercial revenue related to an expansion with an existing customer. The decrease in government revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period last year was primarily related to a health plan customer who gave notice in October 2023 of its intent not to continue using our services after February 2024 and a decrease in enrolled members. 
 
 Cost of Revenue, Gross Profit and Gross Profit Margin 
 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, (In thousands, except percentages) 2024 2023 Change Change 2024 2023 Change Change Cost of revenue 975 1,040 (65) (6) 2,794 2,691 103 4 Gross profit 1,594 2,675 (1,081) (40) 4,906 6,513 (1,607) (25) Gross profit margin 62 72 (10) 64 71 (7) 
 
 Cost of revenue decreased (0.07) million, or (6) , in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period of 2023, and increased 0.1 million, or 4 , in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period of 2023. The decrease in cost of revenue during the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to a decrease in provider costs. The increase in cost of revenue during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to higher employee compensation and benefit costs, partially offset by a decrease in provider costs. 
 
 Gross profit decreased by 1.1 million and gross profit margin decreased by 10 in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period of 2023, and gross profit decreased by 1.6 million and gross profit margin decreased by 7 in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period of 2023. The decrease in gross profit margin in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to the decrease in revenue, as discussed above.

 Total operating expenses decreased by 0.04 million, or 1 , in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. The decrease in operating expenses was primarily due to: 
 
 a 0.3 million decrease in our research and development costs, which was primarily related to a 0.3 million decrease in amortization expense and a 0.2 million decrease in depreciation expense, partially offset by a 0.2 million increase in employee-related costs; 
 a 0.04 million decrease in our sales and marketing costs, which was primarily related to a 0.08 million decrease in employee related cost in our sales and marketing department, partially offset by a 0.1 million increase in software related expenses; and 
 a 0.3 million increase in our general and administrative costs, which was primarily related to a 0.5 million increase in employee-related costs, partially offset by a 0.2 million decrease in legal costs. 
 Total operating expenses decreased by 4.1 million, or 18 , in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. The decrease in operating expenses was primarily due to: 
 
 a 1.4 million decrease in our research and development costs, which was primarily related to a 0.9 million decrease in amortization expense, a 0.3 million decrease in depreciation expense, a 0.2 million decrease in employee-related costs and a 0.2 million decrease in software related costs, partially offset by a 0.1 million increase in professional consulting fees; 
 a 0.6 million decrease in our sales and marketing costs, which was primarily related to a 0.9 million decrease in employee related cost in our sales and marketing department, partially offset by a 0.1 million increase in promotional expenses; 
 a 1.9 million decrease in our general and administrative costs, which was primarily related to a 1.8 million decrease in legal costs, a 0.3 million decrease in insurance related costs and a 0.1 million decrease in depreciation expense, partially offset by a 0.2 million increase in software costs and a 0.2 million increase in travel and entertainment expenses; and 
 a 0.2 million decrease in our restructuring, severance and related costs related to the workforce reduction implemented in February 2024 compared to the workforce reduction implemented in March 2023.

Other income, net for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was related to the gain on change in fair value of warrant liabilities. Other expense, net for the three months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily related the gain on change in fair value of warrant liabilities. The 0.3 million of other income, net, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily related to a 0.5 million gain resulting from the write-off of an operating lease asset and liability upon early termination of the lease for office space in Santa Monica, California, partially offset by approximately 0.2 million of net lease termination related fees.

 Income tax benefit, net of 0.08 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, was primarily related to a reversal of accrued estimated income taxes. 

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 
 Going Concern 
 
 We have incurred significant net losses and negative operating cash flows since our inception, and we expect to continue to incur net losses and negative operating cash flow, in part due to the negative impact on our operations by customer terminations. As of September 30, 2024, our total cash was 8.0 million and we had working capital of approximately 1.5 million. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our average monthly cash burn rate from operations was 1.0 million. 
 
 In August 2024, the Company entered into an agreement with Acuitas pursuant to which Acuitas agreed to purchase 5.0 million in principal amount of Committed Demand Notes. See Overview Recent Events August 2024 Amendment to Keep Well Agreement, above. As of the filing date of this report, Acuitas has purchased 3.5 million in principal amount of Committed Demand Notes but has not purchased the remaining 1.5 million in principal amount that was to be purchased no later than November 1, 2024. In addition, Acuitas may, in its sole discretion, elect to purchase up to an additional 5.5 million in 
 44 

principal amount of Demand Notes under the Keep Well Agreement. Management is in active discussion with Acuitas with respect to the purchase of the remaining 1.5 million in principal amount of Committed Demand Notes and some or all of the additional 5.5 million in principal amount of Demand Notes. The Company cannot predict if or when Acuitas will purchase the remaining 1.5 million in principal amount of Committed Demand Notes or will elect to purchase some or all of the additional 5.5 million in principal amount of Demand Notes. 
 
 As of the filing date of this report, approximately 11.1 million of secured debt, including accrued paid-in-kind interest, issued under the Keep Well Agreement was outstanding, 8.6 million of which is represented by Demand Notes (including Committed Demand Notes) payable at any time after August 30, 2025 upon demand of the holder (see Note 10 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this report), and the balance of which matures on May 14, 2026, unless it becomes due and payable in full earlier, whether by acceleration or otherwise. 
 
 In October 2024, the Company received a total of 1.5 million of cash proceeds from the exercise of warrants the Company issued in its public offering consummated in November 2023. Assuming the exercise in full of the warrants the Company issued in such public offering at their current exercise price and that the exercise price is paid in cash, the Company would receive gross proceeds of approximately 13.7 million. There can be no assurance that all or any portion of such warrants will be exercised. 
 
 Management is actively pursuing execution of the Company s growth strategy and has been engaged in discussions with prospects in its sales pipeline, two of which are in or near the final proposal and approval phase, as well as in discussions with existing customers to expand their business relationship with the Company. There can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in any of these endeavors. 
 
 Management plans to continue executing its strategy to increase liquidity by continuing to (i) explore other sources of capital for future liquidity needs; (ii) manage operating costs by strategically pursuing cost optimization initiatives; and (iii) pursue executing our growth strategy by: (a) expanding sales and marketing resources to acquire new and diverse customers across major health plans, value based provider groups and self-insurance employers; (b) executing on our better market penetration strategy by providing full scale customized behavioral health solutions, addressing customer needs across all member acuity levels while mitigating vendor fatigue by becoming a principal customer partner; (c) leveraging our AI technology and new predictive algorithms to improve identification and outreach, create more efficiencies, enhance coaching solutions and create more proof points; and (d) opportunistically pursuing partnerships that we believe will accelerate growth. 
 
 We will need additional capital to successfully execute our growth strategy. In addition to revenue from business operations, since April 2022, the Company's primary source of working capital has been borrowings under the Keep Well Agreement and raising capital in equity offerings. We may seek to raise additional capital through equity or debt financings, however, when we can affect such financings and how much capital we can raise depends on a variety of factors, including, among others, market conditions, the trading price of our common stock and our determination as to the appropriate sources of funding for our operations. There can be no assurance that other capital will be available when needed or that, if available, it will be obtained on terms favorable to us and our stockholders, that we will be successful in implementing cost optimization initiatives, or that we will be successful in executing our growth strategy. In addition, the Keep Well Agreement contains various financial and other covenants, and any non-compliance with those covenants could result in an acceleration of the repayment of the amounts outstanding thereunder. Furthermore, equity or debt financings may have a dilutive effect on the holdings of our existing stockholders, and debt financings may subject us to restrictive covenants, operational restrictions and security interests in our assets. 
 
 Based on the Company's current analysis of the conditions described above and the Company s forecast of its future operating results, the Company does not believe that its cash on hand and its other sources of capital are sufficient to allow the Company to meet its obligations as they become due and to continue its operating activities for at least the next 12 months from the date the financial statements in this report are released. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

Cash Flows 
 The following table sets forth a summary of our cash flows for the periods indicated (in thousands): 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Net cash used in operating activities (9,141) (11,882) Net cash used in investing activities (102) (196) Net cash provided by financing activities 
 7,508 11,592 Net change in cash and restricted cash (1,735) (486) 
 
 Net cash used in operating activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 9.1 million compared with 11.9 million during the same period in 2023. The year-over-year improvement in our cash flow from operations was primarily due to a decrease in net loss which resulted primarily from an improvement in operating expenses resulting from strategic headcount reductions in March 2023 and February 2024 and vendor cost optimization plans. 
 Net cash used in investing activities was approximately 0.1 million for each of the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, which was primarily related to capitalized software development costs. 
 
 Net cash provided by financing activities was 7.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared with 11.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The 7.5 million of net cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily related to 7.0 million of proceeds from borrowings under the Keep Well Agreement and 2.0 million of proceeds from exercises of warrants, partially offset by 1.5 million of financed insurance premium payments. The 11.6 million of net cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily related to 8.0 million of proceeds from borrowings under the Keep Well Agreement and 6.0 million of cash received in escrow under the Keep Well Agreement and held in a separate account, partially offset by 1.8 million of financed insurance premium payments. 
 
 Our total cash was 8.0 million as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 Debt 
 
 See Note 10 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this report for a detailed discussion about our debt. 

OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS 
 During the periods presented, we did not have, nor do we currently have, any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. We are therefore not exposed to the financing, liquidity, market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in those types of relationships. 

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES 
 
 See Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of the 2023 10-K and Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates in Part II, Item 7 of the 2023 10-K for a discussion of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Company s condensed consolidated financial statements. There have been no material changes to the Company s critical accounting policies and estimates since the filing date of the 2023 10-K.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 Not applicable. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 We have evaluated, with the participation of our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer, the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) as of September 30, 2024. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer have concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting during the three months ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 From time to time, we are subject to various legal proceedings that arise in the normal course of our business activities. As of the date of the filing of this report, we are not a party to any litigation the outcome of which, if determined adversely to us, would individually or in the aggregate be reasonably expected to have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position, except for the legal proceedings discussed in Note 13, Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, in Part I, Item 1 of this report, which is incorporated by reference herein. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 
 In evaluating us and our securities, we urge you to carefully consider the risks, uncertainties and other information in this report, as well as the risk factors disclosed in Item 1A to Part I of the 2023 10-K. Any of the risks discussed in this report or any of the risk factors disclosed in Item 1A to Part I of the 2023 10-K, as well as additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial, could materially and adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition. If any of these risks occur, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be harmed, the price of our securities could decline, and future events and circumstances could differ significantly from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements contained in this report. Except as discussed below, there have been no material changes from the risk factors disclosed in Item 1A to Part I of the 2023 10-K. 
 
 Risks Related to Our Common Stock 
 There can be no assurance that our common stock will continue to be listed on Nasdaq or, if listed, that we will be able to comply with the continued listing standards of Nasdaq, which could limit investors ability to transact in our securities and subject us to additional trading restrictions. 
 
 Our common stock is listed on The Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol OTRK. We are required to satisfy continued listing requirements to maintain our listing, including requirements commonly referred to as the minimum bid price rule and either the stockholders equity rule or the market value of listed securities rule. The minimum bid price rule requires that the closing bid price of our common stock be at least 1.00 per share, and the stockholders equity rule requires that our stockholders' equity be at least 2.5 million, or, alternatively, that the market value of our listed securities be at least 35 million or that we

have net income from continuing operations of 500,000 in the most recently completed fiscal year or in two of the three most recently completed fiscal years. 
 
 We were not in compliance with the minimum bid price rule from October 2023 until October 7, 2024, with the stockholders' equity rule from August 2023 until November 2023, and with the minimum bid price rule from September 2022 until August 2023. Although we regained compliance with the applicable rule in each instance, there can be no assurance that we will continue to satisfy those or any other continued listing requirement and maintain the listing of our common stock on Nasdaq. 
 
 When Nasdaq confirmed that we regained compliance with the minimum bid price rule on October 7, 2024, Nasdaq also informed us that, pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rule 5815(d)(4)(A), we will be subject to a Discretionary Panel Monitor for a period of one year from October 7, 2024, and that if, within that one-year period, we fail to maintain compliance with any continued listing requirement, the Listing Qualifications Department will issue a Delist Determination Letter and promptly schedule a new hearing with Nasdaq s Hearings Panel. Notwithstanding Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(2), we will not be permitted to provide a plan of compliance to the Listing Qualifications Department with respect to any deficiency that arises during the one-year monitoring period, and the Listing Qualifications Department will not be permitted to grant additional time for us to regain compliance with respect to any such deficiency. 
 
 In addition to the specified criteria for continued listing, Nasdaq also has broad discretionary public interest authority that it can exercise to apply additional or more stringent criteria for continued listing on Nasdaq. Nasdaq has exercised this discretionary authority in the past. As of the date of the filing of this report, Acuitas is our largest stockholder and the aggregate principal amount we borrowed under the Keep Well Agreement, plus all accrued and unpaid interest thereon, is approximately 11.1 million. Mr. Peizer, our former chief executive officer and chairman of our board of directors, owns and controls Acuitas. On March 1, 2023, the DOJ announced charges and the SEC filed a civil complaint against Mr. Peizer alleging unlawful insider trading in our stock. Neither the Company nor any other current or former director or employee of the Company were charged by the DOJ or sued by the SEC. On June 21, 2024, a federal jury convicted Mr. Peizer of one count of securities fraud and two counts of insider trading. He is scheduled to be sentenced in February 2025. No assurances can be given that Nasdaq will not exercise its discretionary public interest authority to delist our common stock due to public interest concerns related to Acuitas ownership of our common stock or its relationship to us under the Keep Well Agreement. 
 
 In connection with (a) our November 2023 public offering and concurrent private placement and the securities issuable in connection with the conversion of the senior secured convertible notes completed before the closing thereof and (b) the Sixth Amendment, we submitted listing of additional shares applications to Nasdaq in accordance with Nasdaq listing rules. Current Nasdaq practice is not to accept or reject listing of additional shares applications before the closing of a public or private offering. We believe that the issuances of securities in the November 2023 public offering and concurrent private placement, in connection with the conversion of the senior secured convertible notes completed before the closing thereof, and in connection with the Sixth Amendment are all compliant with Nasdaq listing rules. However, Nasdaq could assert that as a result of one or more of these securities issuances, we are not in compliance with Nasdaq listing rules. For example, Nasdaq could assert that the exercise price reset and share adjustment provisions in the Public Offering Warrants, in the Private Placement Warrant, in the New Keep Well Warrants mandate a delisting determination unless such provisions are modified. Should that occur, we would need to obtain (1) with respect to the Public Offering Warrants, the consent of the holders of Public Offering Warrants representing at least a majority of the shares of common stock underlying the Public Offering Warrants then outstanding and each investor in the November 2023 public offering who purchased at least 1.75 million of securities at the closing of the offering, and (2) with respect to the Private Placement Warrant and the New Keep Well Warrants, the consent of Acuitas, for any modifications. The failure to obtain such consent(s) could result in the delisting of our common stock. 
 
 If our common stock is delisted by Nasdaq, and we are not able to list our securities on another national securities exchange, we expect our securities could be quoted on an over-the-counter market. If this were to occur, then we could face significant material adverse consequences, including: (a) less liquid trading market for our securities; (b) more limited market quotations for our securities; (c) determination that our common stock is a penny stock that requires brokers to adhere to more stringent rules and possibly resulting in a reduced level of trading activity in the secondary trading market for our securities; (d) more limited research coverage by stock analysts; (e) loss of reputation; and (f) more difficult and more expensive equity financings in the future. 
 
 The National Securities Markets Improvement Act of 1996, which is a federal statute, prevents or preempts the states from regulating the sale of certain securities, which are referred to as covered securities. If our common stock remains listed on Nasdaq, our common stock will be covered securities. Although the states are preempted from regulating the sale of our securities, the federal statute does allow the states to investigate companies if there is a suspicion of fraud, and, if there is a finding of fraudulent activity, then the states can regulate or bar the sale of covered securities in a particular case. If our securities 
 48 

were no longer listed on Nasdaq and therefore not covered securities, we would be subject to regulation in each state in which we offer our securities. 
 
 Our enrollment rates and engagement of our members could be impacted by accuracy and frequency of the member data that we receive from our customers. 
 
 We depend on and utilize member data that is transmitted to us by our health plan customers to analyze, outreach, enroll and engage members throughout the duration of our WholeHealth+ program. Our ability to enroll our customers members in our WholeHealth+ program may not achieve anticipated enrollment rates for various reasons, one of which is because our ability to perform identification algorithms designed to increase customers members enrollment can be adversely impacted when our customers delay transmitting, or temporarily do not transmit, member data to us. From time to time, customers may delay, or there may be a temporary pause in, the transmission of member data to us due to various reasons outside of our control, such as transmission errors, system configuration issues, system implementation or transitions, etc. For example, during the quarter ended June 30, 2024, the transmission of member data from one customer to us was temporarily paused during the time that customer performed its internal data security review, which adversely impacted our enrollment efforts with respect to the members of that customer. 
 Risk Related to Our Business 
 
 We will need additional funding to continue our operations and execute our business strategy, and we cannot guarantee that we will raise adequate additional funding on a timely basis, on favorable terms, or at all. 
 
 We have incurred significant net losses and negative operating cash flows since our inception, and we expect to continue to incur net losses and negative operating cash flow, in part due to the negative impact on our operations by customer terminations. As of September 30, 2024, our total cash was 8.0 million and we had working capital of approximately 1.5 million. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our average monthly cash burn rate from operations was 1.0 million. 
 
 In addition, as of the filing date of this report, approximately 11.1 million of secured debt, including accrued paid-in-kind interest, issued under the Keep Well Agreement was outstanding, 8.6 million of which is represented by Demand Notes payable at any time after August 30, 2025 upon demand of the holder, and the balance of which matures on May 14, 2026, unless it becomes due and payable in full earlier, whether by acceleration or otherwise. 
 
 Based on our current analysis of the conditions described above and our forecast of our future operating results, we do not believe that our cash on hand and our other sources of capital are sufficient to allow us to meet our obligations as they become due and to continue our operating activities for at least the next 12 months from the date the financial statements in this report are released. These factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 
 
 We may seek to raise additional capital through equity or debt financings, however, when we can affect such financings and how much capital we can raise depends on a variety of factors, including, among others, market conditions, the trading price of our common stock and our determination as to the appropriate sources of funding for our operations. If we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities, it will result in further dilution to our stockholders and any such equity securities may provide for rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock. If we raise additional funds by issuing debt securities, such securities would have rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock, and the terms of such securities could impose significant restrictions on our operations. We do not know whether, and no assurances can be given that, additional funding will be available to us when needed, on terms favorable to us and our stockholders or at all. If additional adequate funding is not available or is not available on acceptable terms, we may need to downsize, curtail program development efforts or halt our operations altogether. 
 
 A substantial percentage of our revenues are attributable to a few large customers, any or all of which may terminate our services at any time . 
 
 Approximately 98.7 and approximately 93.2 of our total revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were attributable to two and three customers, respectively. Approximately 94.5 and approximately 91.9 of our total revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, were attributable to three customers. Also, two customers represented 100 of our total accounts receivable as of September 30, 2024. We had 0.03 million of accounts receivable outstanding as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 49 

We expect that revenues from a limited number of customers will continue for the foreseeable future. Sales to these customers are made pursuant to agreements with flexible termination provisions, generally entitling the customer to terminate with or without cause on limited notice to us, and which have adversely affected our business and financial condition and results. For example, in February 2021 and August 2021 we received notices from each of our then largest customers of their intent not to continue our program, and in October 2023 and October 2024, we received a notice from a large customer of its intent not to continue using our services after February 2024 and December 2024, respectively. We may not be able to keep our key customers, or these customers may decrease their enrollment levels. Any substantial decrease or delay in revenues relating to one or more of our key customers would harm our business and financial condition and results. If revenues relating to current key customers cease or are reduced, we may not obtain sufficient enrollments from other customers necessary to offset any such losses or reductions. 

Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities, Use of Proceeds, and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities 
 All sales of unregistered securities during the three months ended September 30, 2024, if any, were previously reported by the Company in a Current Report on Form 8-K. 

Item 3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities 
 (a) None. 
 (b) Preferred Dividend Arrearage 
 Holders of the Series A Preferred Stock are entitled to receive, when, as and if declared by our board of directors out of funds legally available therefor, cumulative cash dividends at the rate of 9.50 per annum of the 25.00 per share liquidation preference (equivalent to 2.375 per annum per share or 0.593750 per quarter per share). Our board of directors has not declared dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock since May 2022. As such, as of the date of the filing of this report, we had approximately 24.2 million of undeclared dividends in arrears. For more information about the Series A Preferred Stock, see Note 7 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this report. 

Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures 
 Not applicable. 

Item 5. Other Information 
 
 (a) None. 
 
 (b) None. 
 
 (c) During the period from July 1, 2024 to September 30, 2024, none of our directors or officers (as defined in Rule 16a-1(f) under the Exchange Act) or any Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement (as defined in Item 408(a)(1)(i) of Regulation S-K) or any non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement (as defined in Item 408(c) of Regulation S-K).
