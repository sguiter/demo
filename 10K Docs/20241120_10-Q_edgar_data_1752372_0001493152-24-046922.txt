Information 

VIE
STRUCTURE AND ARRANGEMENTS 

Foreign
ownership in companies providing media advertising services is subject to certain restrictions under PRC laws and regulations. To comply
with the PRC laws and regulations, we, through our wholly-owned subsidiary, Changsha Ezagoo Technology Limited (CETL), entered into a
set of contractual arrangements with Beijing Ezagoo Zhicheng Internet Technology Limited (BEZL) and includes its branch company, named
Changsha Branch of Beijing Ezagoo Industrial Development Group Holding Limited (BELCB), and its shareholders. The contractual arrangements
between CETL, BEZL and shareholders of BEZL allow us to: 

1. 
 exercise
 effective control over BEZL and BELCB whereby having the power to direct BEZL and BELCB s activities that most significantly
 drive the economic results of BEZL and BELCB; 

2. 
 receive
 substantially all of the economic benefits and residual returns, and absorb substantially all the risks and expected losses from
 BEZL and BELCB as if it was their sole shareholder; and 

3. 
 have
 an exclusive option to purchase all of the equity interests in BEZL and BELCB. 

Our
consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of our company, our subsidiaries and our consolidated VIE for which
we are the primary beneficiary. All transactions and balances among our company, our subsidiaries and our consolidated VIE have been
eliminated upon consolidation. 

A
subsidiary is an entity in which we, directly or indirectly, control more than one half of the voting powers; or has the power to appoint
or remove the majority of the members of the board of directors; or to cast a majority of votes at the meeting of directors; or has the
power to govern the financial and operating policies of the investee under a statute or agreement among the shareholders or equity holders. 

A
consolidated VIE is an entity in which we, or our subsidiaries, through contractual agreements, bears the risks of, and enjoys the rewards
normally associated with ownership of the entity. In determining whether we or our subsidiaries are the primary beneficiary, we considered
whether it has the power to direct activities that are significant to the consolidated VIE s economic performance, and also our
obligation to absorb losses of the consolidated VIE that could potentially be significant to the consolidated VIE or the right to receive
benefits from the consolidated VIE that could potentially be significant to the consolidated VIE. We hold all the variable interests
of the consolidated VIE and its subsidiaries, and has been determined to be the primary beneficiary of the consolidated VIE. 

In
accordance with the contractual agreements among between CETL, BEZL, BELCB and shareholders of BEZL and BELCB allow us to: 

1. 
 exercise
 effective control over BEZL and BELCB whereby having the power to direct BEZL and BELCB s activities that most significantly
 drive the economic results of BEZL; 

2. 
 receive
 substantially all of the economic benefits and residual returns, and absorb substantially all the risks and expected losses from
 BEZL and BELCB as if it was their sole shareholder; 

3. 
 and
 have an exclusive option to purchase all of the equity interests in BEZL and BELCB. 

We
believe that the contractual arrangements among CETL, BEZL, BELCB and the shareholders of BEZL are in compliance with PRC law and are
legally enforceable. However, uncertainties in the PRC legal system could limit our ability to enforce these contractual arrangements
and if the shareholders of our consolidated VIE were to reduce their interest in us, their interests may diverge from ours and that may
potentially increase the risk that they would seek to act contrary to the contractual terms. 

Our
ability to control the consolidated VIE also depends on the voting rights proxy agreement and our company, through CETL, has to vote
on all matters requiring shareholder approval in the consolidated VIE. As noted above, we believe this voting rights proxy agreement
is legally enforceable but may not be as effective as direct equity ownership. 

The
Company s mailing address is Rm 205, 2/F, Building 17, Yard 1, Li Ze Road, Feng Tai District, Beijing 100073, China.

Item
4 Controls and Procedures. 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures: 

We
carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange
Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) as of September 30, 2024. This evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation
of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective due to the presence of material
weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting. 

A
material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is
a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented
or detected on a timely basis. Management has identified the following material weaknesses which have caused management to conclude that,
as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective: (i) inadequate segregation of duties and effective
risk assessment; and (ii) insufficient written policies and procedures for accounting and financial reporting with respect to the requirements
and application of both US GAAP and SEC guidelines. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting: 

There
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ending September 30, 2024, that have materially affected,
or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
