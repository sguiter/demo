 We review the carrying amounts of non-financial assets, primarily long-lived property and equipment, finance lease assets, operating lease assets, reacquired franchise rights, goodwill, and transferable liquor licenses annually or when events or circumstances indicate that the fair value may not substantially exceed the carrying amount. We record an impairment charge for the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value.

 7. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES 
 million and million, respectively. These amounts represent the maximum known potential liability of rent payments under the leases, but outstanding rent payments can exist outside of our knowledge as a result of the landlord and tenant relationship being between two third parties. These leases have been assigned to the buyers and expire at the end of the respective lease terms, which range from fiscal 2025 through fiscal 2035. In the event of default under a lease by an owner of a divested brand, the indemnity and default clauses in our agreements with such third parties and applicable laws govern our ability to pursue and recover amounts we may pay on behalf of such parties. We have received notices of default and have been named a party in lawsuits pertaining to some of these leases in circumstances where the current lessee did not pay its rent obligations. During the first quarter of fiscal 2024, we recorded a million charge in Other (gains) and charges in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Unaudited). We will continue to closely monitor our exposure. 
 Letters of Credit 
 We provide letters of credit to various insurers to collateralize obligations for outstanding claims. As of September 25, 2024, we had million in undrawn standby letters of credit outstanding. All standby letters of credit are renewable within the next 13 months. 
 Cyber Security Litigation 
 In fiscal 2018, we discovered malware at certain Chili s restaurants that may have resulted in unauthorized access or acquisition of customer payment card data. We settled all claims from payment card companies related to this incident and do not expect material claims from payment card companies in the future. In connection with this event, the Company was also named as a defendant in a putative class action lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida (the Litigation relating to this incident. In the Litigation, plaintiffs assert various claims at the Company s Chili s restaurants involving customer payment card information and seek monetary damages in excess of million, injunctive and declaratory relief, and attorney s fees and costs. 
 On April 29, 2024, the US Supreme Court denied our petition for certiorari concerning review of the Eleventh Circuit s decision to uphold plaintiff s damages calculation. Accordingly, the parties continue to await the trial court s ruling on the issue of predominance as it relates to class certification in light of the Eleventh Circuit s ruling on this issue. We believe we have defenses and intend to continue defending the Litigation. As such, as of September 25, 2024, we have concluded that a loss, or range of loss, from this matter is not determinable, therefore, we have not recorded a liability related to the Litigation. We will continue to evaluate this matter based on new information as it becomes available. 
 Legal Proceedings 
 Evaluating contingencies related to litigation is a process involving judgment on the potential outcome of future events, and the ultimate resolution of litigated claims may differ from our current analysis. Accordingly, we review the adequacy of accruals and disclosures pertaining to litigated matters each quarter in consultation with legal counsel and we assess the probability and range of possible losses associated with contingencies for potential accrual in the Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited). 
 We are engaged in various legal proceedings and have certain unresolved claims pending. Liabilities have been established based on our best estimates of our potential liability in certain of these matters. Based upon consultation with legal counsel, management is of the opinion that there are matters pending or threatened which are expected to have a material adverse effect, individually or in the aggregate, on the consolidated financial condition or results of operations.

 million share repurchase program during fiscal 2022. Our share repurchase program is used to return capital to shareholders and to minimize the dilutive impact of stock options and other share-based awards. We evaluate potential share repurchases under our plan based on several factors, including our cash position, share price, operational liquidity, proceeds from divestitures, borrowings and planned investment and financing needs. Repurchased shares are reflected as an increase in Treasury stock within Shareholders equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheets (Unaudited). 
 In the thirteen week period ended September 25, 2024, we repurchased million shares of our common stock for million, including million shares purchased for million as part of our share repurchase program and million shares purchased from team members to satisfy tax withholding obligations on the vesting of restricted shares. These withheld shares of common stock are not considered common stock repurchases under our authorized common stock repurchase plan. As of September 25, 2024, approximately million of share repurchase authorization remains under the current share repurchase program.

 ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 
 General 
 The following Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations MD A is intended to help you understand our Company, our operations, and our current operating environment. For an understanding of the significant factors that influenced our performance during the thirteen week periods ended September 25, 2024 and September 27, 2023, the MD A should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) and related Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) included in this quarterly report. All amounts within the MD A are presented in millions unless otherwise specified. 
 
 Overview 
 We own, develop, operate, and franchise the Chili s Grill Bar Chili s and Maggiano s Little Italy Maggiano s restaurant brands. As of September 25, 2024 we owned, operated or franchised 1,625 restaurants, consisting of 1,170 Company-owned restaurants and 455 franchised restaurants, located in the United States, 28 other countries and two United States territories. Our restaurant brands, Chili s and Maggiano s, are both operating segments and reporting units. 
 Operating Environment 
 During the recent years, our operating results were impacted by geopolitical and other macroeconomic events, leading to higher than usual inflation on wages and food and beverage costs. Geopolitical and other macroeconomic events have led, and in the future may lead to, wage inflation, staffing challenges, product cost inflation and/or disruptions in the supply chain that impact our restaurants ability to obtain the products needed to support their operation. Such events could also negatively affect consumer spending potentially reducing guest traffic and/or reducing the average amount guests spend in our restaurants. 
 Operations Strategy 
 We are committed to strategies and a Company culture that we believe will grow sales, increase profits, bring back guests and engage team members. Our strategies and culture are intended to strengthen our position in casual dining and grow our core business over time. Our primary brand strategy is to make our guests feel special through great food and quality service so that they return to our restaurants. 
 Chili s - Our strategy is to make everyone feel special through a fun atmosphere, delicious food and drinks and our Chili s hospitality. We are making work at Chili s easier, more fun, and more rewarding for our team members so that they are more engaged and provide a better experience for our guests. One way we have done this is by eliminating tasks that were unnecessary and did not add value to our guests. We have also simplified our menu to focus on core equities we believe can help grow sales burgers, fajitas, Chicken Crispers , and margaritas, as well as other classic favorites. Our team members can make our core menu items better and more consistently because we have fewer menu items that need to be perfected. 
 We have a flexible platform of value offerings at both lunch and dinner that we believe is compelling to our guests. Our 3 for Me platform allows guests to enjoy a non-alcoholic drink, an appetizer and certain entr es starting at just 10.99. We believe our value offerings will continue to be an important traffic driver in the current economic circumstances and we will continue to highlight this value in our marketing efforts. We have increased menu pricing in other areas in light of the inflationary challenges and we have also improved menu offerings and merchandising to incentivize our guests to purchase higher priced items. 
 In addition, Chili s has focused on a seamless digital experience as our guests preferences and expectations around dining convenience have evolved in recent years. Investments in our technology and off-premise options have enabled us to provide a faster, more convenient dine-in experience and to offer more To-Go and delivery options for our guests. Our To-Go menu is available through the Chili s mobile app, chilis.com, our delivery partners DoorDash, Uber Eats and Grubhub, Google Food Ordering or by calling the restaurant directly. Our It s Just

 Wings offering is available through the website, itsjustwings.com. The operating results for this virtual brand are included in the results of our Chili s brand, based on the restaurants that prepared and processed the food orders. 
 In dining rooms, we use tabletop devices with functionality for guests to pay at the table, provide guest feedback and interact with our My Chili s Rewards program. Our My Chili s Rewards loyalty program offers free chips and salsa or a non-alcoholic beverage to members based on their visit frequency and allows us to communicate and advertise to our guests through email and text. Our servers use handheld tablets to place orders for our guests, increasing the efficiency of our team members and allowing orders to reach our kitchen quicker for better service to our guests. 
 Maggiano s - At Maggiano s, we are focused on making our guests feel special. This warm and generous hospitality creates an environment where guests come together to celebrate birthdays, weddings, and many more special occasions. While our dining rooms support the majority of our business, we also offer carry-out and delivery options through partnerships with delivery service providers that have made our restaurants more accessible to guests. Our restaurants also have banquet rooms to host large party events and we have begun to renovate these banquet rooms in certain restaurants to provide a better experience for this profitable revenue channel, particularly during the holiday season in the second and third quarters of the fiscal year. 
 Franchise Partnerships - During the thirteen week period ended September 25, 2024, there were 14 new franchise restaurant openings. We plan to strategically pursue expansion of Chili s internationally through development agreements with new and existing franchise partners. 
 Company Development - The following table details the number of restaurant openings during the thirteen week periods ended September 25, 2024 and September 27, 2023, respectively, total full year projected openings in fiscal 2025 and the total restaurants open at each period end:

 Cash Flows from Investing Activities 
 Thirteen Week Periods Ended Favorable (Unfavorable) Variance September 25, 2024 September 27, 2023 Net cash used in investing activities (56.5) (45.6) (10.9)

 Thirteen Week Periods Ended Favorable (Unfavorable) Variance September 25, 2024 September 27, 2023 Net cash used in financing activities (54.7) (14.2) (40.5) 
 Net cash used in financing activities increased primarily due to an increase in share repurchase activity in fiscal 2025 of 50.1 million, partially offset by an increase of 11.0 million in net borrowing activity on the revolving credit facility. 
 Debt 
 During the thirteen week period ended September 25, 2024, net borrowings of 25.0 million were drawn on the revolving credit facility. As of September 25, 2024, 875.0 million of credit was available under the revolving credit facility. 
 Our 900.0 million revolving credit facility, as amended, matures on August 18, 2026 and bears interest at a rate of SOFR plus an applicable margin of 1.60 to 2.35 and an undrawn commitment fee of 0.25 to 0.35 , both based on a function of our debt-to-cash-flow ratio. As of September 25, 2024, our interest rate was 6.46 consisting of SOFR of 4.86 plus the applicable margin and spread adjustment of 1.60 . 
 As of September 25, 2024, we were in compliance with our covenants pursuant to the 900.0 million revolving credit facility and under the terms of the indentures governing our 5.000 and 8.250 notes. We expect to remain in compliance with our covenants during the remainder of fiscal 2024. 
 Subsequent to the end of the first quarter, on October 1, 2024, our 350.0 million of 5.000 senior notes matured and were repaid using available capacity under our existing revolving credit facility. Refer to Note 6 - Debt for further information about our notes and revolving credit facility.

 Share Repurchase Program 
 Our Board of Directors approved a 300.0 million share repurchase program during fiscal 2022. Our share repurchase program is used to return capital to shareholders and to minimize the dilutive impact of stock options and other share-based awards. We evaluate potential share repurchases under our plan based on several factors, including our cash position, share price, operational liquidity, proceeds from divestitures, borrowings and planned investment and financing needs. 
 In the thirteen week period ended September 25, 2024, we repurchased 1.1 million shares of our common stock for 74.8 million, including 0.9 million shares purchased for 66.0 million as part of our share repurchase program and 0.2 million shares purchased from team members to satisfy tax withholding obligations on the vesting of restricted shares. These withheld shares of common stock are not considered common stock repurchases under our authorized common stock repurchase plan. As of September 25, 2024, approximately 117.0 million of share repurchase authorization remains under the current share repurchase program. 
 Cash Flow Outlook 
 As a result of uncertainties in the near-term macro environment, including supply chain challenges, and commodity and labor inflation, we continue to focus on cash flow generation and maintaining a solid and flexible financial position to execute our long-term strategy of investing in our business. We continue to monitor the macro environment and will adjust our overall approach to capital allocation, including share repurchases, as events and macroeconomic trends unfold. 
 Based on the current level of operations, we believe that our current cash and cash equivalents, coupled with cash generated from operations and availability under our existing revolving credit facility will be adequate to meet our capital expenditure and working capital needs for at least the next twelve months, including the repayment of the 350.0 million senior notes which occurred on October 1, 2024. 
 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions for the reporting periods covered by the financial statements. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent liabilities. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Our critical accounting estimates have not changed materially from those previously reported in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 26, 2024. 
 
 Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
 The impact of recent accounting pronouncements can be found at Note 1 - Basis of Presentation in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) set forth in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q report. 
 
 ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 The terms of our revolving credit facility require us to pay interest on outstanding borrowings at SOFR plus an applicable margin based on a function of our debt-to-cash flow ratio. As of September 25, 2024, 25.0 million was outstanding under the revolving credit facility. We estimate that a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in the current interest rate on the outstanding balance of this variable rate financial instrument as of September 25, 2024 would result in an additional 0.3 million of annual interest expense.

Table of Contents 

 Commodity Price Risk 
 We purchase food and other commodities for use in our operations based on market prices established with our suppliers. While our purchasing commitments partially mitigate the risk of such fluctuations, there is no assurance that supply and demand factors such as inclement weather or recent geopolitical unrest, will not cause the prices of the commodities used in our restaurant operations to fluctuate. Additionally, if there is a time lag between increasing commodity prices and our ability to increase menu prices or if we believe a commodity price increase to be short in duration and we choose not to pass on the cost increases, our short-term financial results could be negatively affected. 
 
 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 EVALUATION OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Based on their evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13(a)-15(e) and 15(d)-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934), as of the end of the period covered by this report, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective. 
 INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING
