 eFC is a financial services careers website, operating websites in multiple markets in four languages mainly across the United Kingdom, Continental Europe, Asia, the Middle East and North America.

The Company has evaluated its common share interest in the eFC business and has determined the investment meets the definition and criteria of a variable interest entity ("VIE"). The Company evaluated the VIE and determined that the Company does not have a controlling financial interest in the VIE, as the Company does not have the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE's economic performance. The common share interest is being accounted for under the equity method of accounting as the Company has the ability to exercise significant influence over eFC. The investment was recorded at its fair value on June 30, 2021, the date of transfer, which was million. The Company's equity in the net assets of eFC as of June 30, 2021 was million. The difference between the Company's recorded value and its equity in net assets of eFC was reduced during the third quarter of 2023, as described above, as the Company reduced its ownership in eFC. The remaining basis difference at the time of sale was million and is being amortized against the recorded value of the investment in accordance with ASC 323 Investments - Equity Method and Joint Ventures . Amortization expense during the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was not significant.

 The annual impairment test for the Tech-focused reporting unit is performed on October 1 of each year. The results of the impairment test indicated that the fair value of the Tech-focused reporting unit was substantially in excess of the carrying value as of October 1, 2023.

You should not place undue reliance on those statements because they are subject to numerous uncertainties and factors relating to our operations and business environment, all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond our control. Forward-looking statements include, without limitation, information concerning our possible or assumed future financial condition, liquidity and results of operations, including expectations (financial or otherwise), our strategy, plans, objectives, and intentions, and growth potential.

These statements are based on assumptions that we have made in light of our experience in the industry as well as our perceptions of historical trends, current conditions, expected future developments and other factors we believe are appropriate under the circumstances. Although we believe that these forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, you should be aware that many factors could affect our actual financial results or results of operations and could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements.

These factors and others are discussed in more detail below and in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, under the headings Risk Factors, Forward-Looking Statements and Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 
 
 You should keep in mind that any forward-looking statement made by us herein, or elsewhere, speaks only as of the date on which it is made. New risks and uncertainties come up from time to time, and it is impossible to predict these events or how they may affect us. We have no obligation to update any forward-looking statements after the date hereof, except as required by federal securities laws.

 Overview 
 
 We are a provider of software products, online tools and services that deliver career marketplaces to candidates and employers in the United States. DHI s brands, Dice and ClearanceJobs, enable recruiters and hiring managers to efficiently search, match and connect with highly skilled technologists in specialized fields, particularly technology and active government security clearance. Professionals find ideal employment opportunities, relevant job advice and personalized data that help manage their technologist lives. 
 
 In online recruitment, we specialize in employment categories in which there has been a long-term scarcity of highly skilled, highly qualified professionals relative to market demand, specifically technologists who work in a variety of industries or have active government security clearances. Our websites serve as online two-sided marketplaces where employers and recruiters source and connect with prospective employees, and where technologists find relevant job opportunities, data and information to further their careers. Our websites offer job postings, news and content, career development and recruiting services tailored to the specific needs of the professional community that each website serves. 
 
 We have been in the recruiting and career development business for over 30 years. Based on our operating structure, we have identified one reportable segment, Tech-focused, which includes the Dice and ClearanceJobs businesses and corporate related costs. The Dice and ClearanceJobs businesses and corporate related costs are aggregated into the Tech-focused reportable segment primarily because the Company does not have discrete financial information for those brands or costs. 
 
 Our Revenue and Expenses 
 
 We derive the majority of our revenue from customers who pay fees, either annually, quarterly or monthly, to post jobs on our websites and to access our searchable databases of resumes. Our fees vary by customer based on the number of individual users of our databases of resumes, the number and type of job postings and profile views purchased and the terms of the packages purchased, which are predominately annual agreements. Our Company sells recruitment packages, which comprise greater than 
 20 

Table of Contents 

 90 of our total revenue, that can include access to our databases of resumes and job posting capabilities. We believe the key metrics that are material to an analysis of our businesses are our total number of Dice and ClearanceJobs recruitment package customers and the revenue, on average, that these customers generate. The Company's management uses these metrics to monitor the current and future activity of the businesses. The tables below detail this customer data. 
 
 As of September 30, Increase (Decrease) Percent Change Recruitment Package Customers: 2024 2023 ClearanceJobs 1,982 2,054 (72) (4) Dice 4,868 5,752 (884) (15)

 Three months ended September 30, Nine months ended September 30, 2024 2023 Increase (Decrease) Percent Change 2024 2023 Increase (Decrease) Percent Change ClearanceJobs 24,762 21,422 3,340 16 24,029 20,928 3,101 15 Dice 16,330 15,531 799 5 16,207 15,578 629 4 (1) Calculated by dividing recruitment package customer revenue by the daily average count of recruitment package customers during each month, adjusted to reflect a 30-day month. The simple average of each month is used to derive the amount for each period and then annualized to reflect 12 months. 

ClearanceJobs had 1,982 recruitment package customers as of September 30, 2024 compared to 2,054 as of September 30, 2023, a decrease of 4 , and average annual revenue per recruitment package customer increased 3,340, or 16 , from the prior year quarter. The increased revenue per recruitment package customer for ClearanceJobs was due to continued high demand for professionals with government security clearance and consistent product releases and enhancements driving activity on the site. The lower customer count was the result of churn among ClearanceJob's smaller customers while larger customers expanded the value of their contracts with ClearanceJobs. Dice had 4,868 recruitment package customers as of September 30, 2024, which was a decrease of 884, or 15 , and average annual revenue per recruitment package customer for Dice increased 799, or 5 , from the prior year quarter. The decrease in recruitment package customers was due to macroeconomic conditions causing customer counts to decline while the average annual revenue per recruitment package customer increased driven by strong retention rates as our larger recurring customers continue to renew with Dice. 
 
 Deferred revenue, as shown on the condensed consolidated balance sheets, reflects customer billings made in advance of services being rendered. Backlog consists of deferred revenue plus customer contractual commitments not invoiced representing the value of future services to be rendered under committed contracts. We believe backlog to be an important measure of our business as it represents our ability to generate future revenue. A summary of our deferred revenue and backlog is as follows: 
 
 Comparison to Prior Year End Comparison Year Over Year 9/30/2024 12/31/2023 Increase (Decrease) Percent Change 9/30/2023 Increase (Decrease) Percent Change Deferred Revenue 46,913 49,971 (3,058) (6) 48,844 (1,931) (4) Contractual commitments not invoiced 56,595 58,126 (1,531) (3) 59,559 (2,964) (5) Backlog (1) 
 103,508 108,097 (4,589) (4) 108,403 (4,895) (5) (1) Backlog consists of deferred revenue plus customer contractual commitments not invoiced representing the value of future services to be rendered under committed contracts. 
 
 Backlog at September 30, 2024 decreased 4.6 million from December 31, 2023 and decreased 4.9 million from September 30, 2023. The decrease in backlog compared to December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2023 is due to macroeconomic conditions causing lower demand for the Company's services. 
 
 Our contracts are subject to delay or default and contracts in the Company's backlog are subject to changes in the scope of services to be provided as well as adjustments to the costs relating to the applicable contracts. Backlog may also be affected by, among other things, external market and economic factors beyond our control. Accordingly, there is no assurance that the 
 21 

Table of Contents 

 entirety of our backlog will be realized. The timing of new contracts and the mix of services can significantly affect backlog. Backlog at any given point in time may not accurately represent the future revenue that may be realized and should not be relied upon as a stand-alone indicator of future revenues. 
 
 To a lesser extent, we also generate revenue from advertising on our various websites, employer branding solutions or from lead generation and marketing solutions provided to our customers. Advertisements include various forms of rich media and banner advertising, text links, sponsorships, and custom content marketing solutions. Lead generation information utilizes advertising and other methods to deliver leads to customers. Employer branding pages provide an opportunity for customers to promote company culture and values to candidates. 
 
 The Company continues to evolve and present new software products and features to attract and engage qualified professionals and match them with employers. Our ability to grow our revenue will largely depend on our ability to grow our customer bases in the markets in which we operate by acquiring new customers while retaining a high proportion of the customers we currently serve, and to expand the breadth of services our customers purchase from us. We continue to make investments in our business and infrastructure to help us achieve our long-term growth objectives, such as the innovative products in the table below. 
 
 Product Releases 2024 2023 Dice Discover Companies, TopResume Integration, Dice Privacy Trust Center Dice Premium Enhanced Company Profile, Dice Remote and Company Preferences, Dice Invite To Apply, Dice Matchscore on Jobs, Dice Connections ClearanceJobs Live ClearanceJobs Comments, ClearanceJobs Expressed Interest, ClearanceJobs Enhanced Employer Profile, ClearanceJobs Mobile App 
 
 Other material factors that may affect our results of operations include our ability to attract qualified professionals that become engaged with our websites and our ability to attract customers with relevant job opportunities. The more qualified professionals that use our websites, the more attractive our websites become to employers and advertisers, which in turn makes them more likely to become our customers, resulting positively on our results of operations. If we are unable to continue to attract qualified professionals to engage with our two-sided marketplaces, our customers may no longer find our services attractive, which could have a negative impact on our results of operations. Additionally, we need to ensure that our websites remain relevant in order to attract qualified professionals to our websites and to engage them in high-value tasks, such as posting resumes and/or applying for jobs. 
 
 The largest components of our expenses are personnel costs and marketing and sales expenditures. Personnel costs consist of salaries, benefits, and incentive compensation for our employees, including commissions for salespeople. Personnel costs are categorized in our statement of operations based on each employee s principal function. Personnel costs incurred during the application development stage of internal use software and website development are recorded as fixed assets and amortized to depreciation expense in the statement of operations over the estimated useful life of the asset. Marketing expenditures primarily consist of online advertising, brand promotion and lead generation to employers and job seekers.

 Our effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, differed from the statutory rate due to tax expense of 2.0 million from the tax impacts of share-based compensation awards and 0.2 million from state taxes related to research and development expenditures. The tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, differed from the statutory rate due to tax benefits of 0.4 million from the tax impacts of share-based compensation awards and 0.4 million from research tax credits. 
 
 Earnings (Loss) per Share 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 (in thousands, except per share amounts) Net income (loss) (769) 1,343 Weighted-average shares outstanding - basic 44,550 43,582 Weighted-average shares outstanding - diluted 44,550 44,579 Basic earnings (loss) per share (0.02) 0.03 Diluted earnings (loss) per share (0.02) 0.03 
 
 Diluted earnings (loss) per share was (0.02) and 0.03 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease was driven by higher tax expense, primarily the tax impacts of stock-based compensation, partially offset by higher operating income, as described above. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Cash Flows 
 
 A summary of our cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 follows (in thousands):

Table of Contents 

 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Cash from operating activities 16,676 13,724 Cash used in investing activities (11,146) (10,047) Cash from (used in) financing activities (7,663) (2,959) 
 We have financed our operations primarily through cash provided by operating activities and borrowings under our revolving credit facility. At September 30, 2024, we had cash of 2.1 million compared to 4.2 million at December 31, 2023. 
 
 Liquidity 
 
 Our principal internal sources of liquidity are cash, as well as the cash flow that we generate from our operations. In addition, we had 58.0 million in borrowing capacity under our 100.0 million Credit Agreement, as defined below, at September 30, 2024. Borrowings are subject to certain availability limits including our consolidated leverage ratio, which generally limits borrowings to 2.5 times annual Adjusted EBITDA levels, as defined in the Credit Agreement. We believe that our existing cash, cash generated from our continuing operations and available borrowings under our Credit Agreement will be sufficient to satisfy our currently anticipated cash requirements through at least the next 12 months and the foreseeable future thereafter. However, it is possible that one or more lenders under the Credit Agreement may refuse or be unable to satisfy their commitment to lend to us, we may violate one or more of our covenants or financial ratios contained in our Credit Agreement or we may need to refinance our debt and be unable to do so. In addition, our liquidity could be negatively affected by a decrease in demand for our products and services and the ability of our customers to pay for current or future services. We may also make acquisitions and may need to raise additional capital through future debt financings or equity offerings to the extent necessary to fund such acquisitions, which we may not be able to do on a timely basis or on terms satisfactory to us or at all. 
 
 Operating Activities 
 
 Net cash flows from operating activities primarily consist of net income adjusted for certain non-cash items, including depreciation, amortization, changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities, stock-based compensation, income from equity method investments, gain or impairments on investments, and the effect of changes in working capital. Net cash flows from operating activities were 16.7 million and 13.7 million for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Cash inflow from operations is driven by earnings and is dependent on the amount and timing of payments to vendors and employees and billings to and cash collections from our customers. Cash provided by operating activities during the 2024 period increased 3.0 million compared to the same period of 2023 due to lower people costs, including lower payments for bonus, wages and commissions and the timing of payments to vendors. The reductions were partially offset by lower billings to and cash collections from our customers. 
 
 Investing Activities 
 
 Cash used in investing activities during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 was 11.1 million compared to 10.0 million used in the same period of 2023. Cash used in investing activities in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 is primarily comprised of 9.8 million of capitalized development costs and 1.0 million of costs associated with the Company's office space. Cash used in investing activities in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023 is primarily comprised of 12.8 million of capitalized development costs and 1.2 million of costs associated with the Company's office space, partially offset by 4.9 million of cash received from the sale of its investment in eFinancialCareers as described above. 
 
 Financing Activities 
 
 Cash used in financing activities during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 was 7.7 million and was driven by 6.0 million of net payments on long-term debt and 1.7 million related to share repurchases. Cash used in financing activities during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023 was 3.0 million and was driven by 13 million related to share repurchases, partially offset by 10.0 million of net proceeds on long-term debt.

 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 
 We have provided certain non-GAAP financial information as additional information for our operating results. These measures are not in accordance with, or alternatives to measures in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may be different from similarly titled non-GAAP measures reported by other companies. We believe the presentation of non-GAAP measures, such as Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin, provides useful information to management and investors regarding certain financial and business trends relating to our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the Company s management uses these measures for reviewing the financial results of the Company and for budgeting and planning purposes. Non-GAAP results exclude the impact of items that management believes affect the comparability or underlying business trends in our condensed consolidated financial statements in the periods presented. The non-GAAP measures apply to consolidated results or other measures as shown within this document. The Company has provided required reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP measures below. 
 Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin 
 Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin are non-GAAP measures used by management to measure operating performance. Management uses Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin as performance measures for internal monitoring and planning, including preparation of annual budgets, analyzing investment decisions and evaluating profitability and performance comparisons between us and our competitors. The Company also uses these measures to calculate amounts of performance-based compensation under the senior management incentive bonus program. Adjusted EBITDA represents net income plus (to the extent deducted in calculating such net income) interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization, and items such as non-cash stock-based compensation, certain write-offs in connection with indebtedness, impairment charges with respect to long-lived assets, expenses incurred in connection with an equity offering or any other offering of securities by the Company, extraordinary or non-recurring non-cash expenses or losses, losses from equity method investments, transaction costs in connection with the Credit Agreement, deferred revenue written off in connection with acquisition purchase accounting adjustments, write-off of non-cash stock-based compensation expense, impairment of investment, severance and retention costs related to dispositions and reorganizations of the Company, restructuring charges and losses related to legal claims and fees that are unusual in nature or infrequent, minus (to the extent included in calculating such net income) non-cash income or gains, including income from equity method investments, interest income, business interruption insurance proceeds, and gains related to legal claims that are unusual in nature or infrequent. 
 Adjusted EBITDA Margin is computed as Adjusted EBITDA divided by revenue. 
 We also consider Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin, as defined above, to be important indicators to investors because they provide information related to our ability to provide cash flows to meet future debt service, capital expenditures, working capital requirements, and to fund future growth. We present Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin as supplemental performance measures because we believe that these measures provide our Board of Directors (the "Board"), management and investors with additional information to measure our performance, provide comparisons from period to period by excluding potential differences caused by variations in capital structures (affecting interest expense) and tax positions (such as the impact on periods or companies of changes in effective tax rates or net operating losses), and to estimate our value. 
 We understand that although Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin are frequently used by securities analysts, lenders and others in their evaluation of companies, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider them in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of our liquidity or results as reported under GAAP. Some limitations are: 
 
 Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin do not reflect our cash expenditures, or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; 
 Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; 
 Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin do not reflect interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our debt; 
 Although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized often will have to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements; and 
 Other companies in our industry may calculate Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin differently than we do, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures. 
 31 

Table of Contents 

 To compensate for these limitations, management evaluates our liquidity by considering the economic effect of excluded expense items independently, as well as in connection with its analysis of cash flows from operations and through the use of other financial measures, such as capital expenditure budget variances, investment spending levels and return on capital analysis. 
 Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin are not measurements of our financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to revenue, operating income, net income, net income margin, cash provided by operating activities, or any other performance measures derived in accordance with GAAP as a measure of our profitability or liquidity.

 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 
 There have been no material changes to our critical accounting estimates as compared to the critical accounting policies described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. 

Financing and Capital Requirements 
 
 Credit Agreement 
 
 In June 2022, the Company, together with Dice Inc. (a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company) and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Dice Career Solutions, Inc.,entered into a Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the Credit Agreement ), which matures in June 2027. Under the Credit Agreement, we have a 100 million revolving credit facility, with an expansion option of 50 million, bringing the total facility to 150 million, with million of borrowings on the facility at September 30, 2024. The Company has million available for future borrowings, subject to the terms of the Credit Agreement, which generally limits borrowings to 2.5 times annual Adjusted EBITDA levels. Borrowings under the Credit Agreement denominated in U.S. dollars bear interest, payable at least quarterly, at the Company s option, at the Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("SOFR") or a base rate, plus a margin. Borrowings under the credit agreement denominated in pounds sterling, if any, bear interest at the Sterling Overnight Index Average ("SONIA") rate plus a margin. The margin ranges from 2.00 to 2.75 on SOFR and SONIA loans and 1.00 to 1.75 on base rate loans, determined by the Company's most recent consolidated leverage ratio, plus an additional spread of 0.10 . The Company incurs a commitment fee ranging from 0.35 to 0.50 on any unused capacity under the revolving loan facility, determined by the Company's most recent consolidated leverage ratio. Assuming an interest rate of (the rate in effect on September 30, 2024) on our current borrowings, interest payments are expected to be 0.6 million from October 1, 2024 to December 31, 2024, 2.2 million in each of 2025 and 2026, and 1.1 million in 2027. The Credit Agreement contains various affirmative and negative covenants and also contains certain financial covenants, including a consolidated leverage ratio and a consolidated interest coverage ratio. As of September 30, 2024, the Company was in compliance with all of the financial covenants under the Credit Agreement. Refer to Note 10 in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report and Item 3. "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk - Interest Rate Risk." 
 
 Contractual Obligations 
 
 The Company has operating leases for corporate office space and certain equipment. The leases have terms from one year to ten years, some of which include options to renew the lease, and are included in the lease term when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise the option. No leases include options to purchase the leased property. As of September 30, 2024, the value of our lease right-of-use asset was 6.8 million and the value of our lease liability was 11.0 million. See Note 6 to the condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for further information. 
 
 We make commitments to purchase advertising from online vendors, which we pay for on a monthly basis. We have no significant long-term obligations to purchase a fixed or minimum amount with these vendors. 
 
 Other Capital Requirements 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we recorded approximately 1.2 million of unrecognized tax benefits as liabilities, and we are uncertain if or when such amounts may be settled. Related to the unrecognized tax benefits considered permanent differences, we have also recorded a liability for potential penalties and interest. Included in the balance of unrecognized tax benefits at September 30, 2024, are 1.2 million of tax benefits that would affect the effective tax rate if recognized. The Company believes it is reasonably possible that as much as 0.2 million of its unrecognized tax benefits may be recognized in the next 12 months. 
 
 The Board previously approved a stock repurchase program that permitted the Company to repurchase its common stock. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had no stock repurchase programs and all previously approved stock repurchase programs had expired in accordance with their terms. Management has discretion in determining the conditions under which shares may be purchased from time to time. See Note 13 to the condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for further information. 
 
 We anticipate capital expenditures for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2024 to be approximately 14 million to 15 million. We intend to use operating cash flows to fund capital expenditures.

 Cyclicality 
 
 The labor market and certain of the industries that we serve have historically experienced short-term cyclicality. However, we believe that online career websites and marketplaces continue to provide economic and strategic value to the labor market and industries that we serve. 
 
 Any slowdown in recruitment activity that occurs could negatively impact our revenues and results of operations. A decrease in the unemployment rate or a labor shortage, including as a result of an increase in job turnover, generally means that employers (including our customers) are seeking to hire more individuals, which would generally lead to more job postings and database licenses and have a positive impact on our revenues and results of operations. Based on historical trends, improvements in labor markets and the need for our services generally lag behind overall economic improvements. Additionally, there has historically been a lag from the time customers begin to increase purchases of our recruitment services and the impact to our revenues due to the recognition of revenue occurring over the length of the contract, which can be several months to over a year. 
 
 From time to time, we see market slowdowns, which can lead to lower demand for recruiting technologists and security cleared professionals. If recruitment activity slows in the industries in which we operate, our revenues and results of operations could be negatively impacted. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
 
 We have exposure to financial market risks, including changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, and other relevant market prices. 
 
 Foreign Exchange Risk 
 
 Our operations are conducted within the United States. As a result, our current operations are not subject to foreign exchange risk. 
 
 The Company's investment in eFC, as described in note 7 to the condensed consolidated financial statements, which is recorded under the equity method of accounting, subjects the Company to foreign exchange risk because the functional currency of eFC is the British Pound Sterling. Accordingly, the Company must translate its share of eFC's net income into United States dollars. The foreign currency translation related to the Company's share of eFC's net income is not expected to be significant. 
 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 
 We have interest rate risk primarily related to borrowings under our Credit Agreement. Borrowings under the Credit Agreement denominated in U.S. dollars bear interest, payable at least quarterly, at the Company s option, at the SOFR or a base rate, plus a margin. Borrowings under the Credit Agreement denominated in pounds sterling, if any, bear interest at the SONIA rate plus a margin. The margin ranges from 2.00 to 2.75 on SOFR and SONIA loans and 1.00 to 1.75 on base rate loans, as determined by our most recent consolidated leverage ratio. As of September 30, 2024, we had outstanding borrowings of 32.0 million under our Credit Agreement. A hypothetical increase of 1.0 on these variable rate borrowings would increase our annual interest expense over the next 12 months by approximately 0.3 million, based on the balances outstanding for these borrowings as of September 30, 2024. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 Our management, under supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer CEO and our Chief Financial Officer CFO ), has conducted an evaluation (pursuant to Rule 13a-15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )) of the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the fiscal period covered by this report. 
 
 These disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports that are filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the Exchange Act and in the rules and forms of the SEC. These disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that this information is accumulated and communicated to management, 
 34 

Table of Contents 

 including the principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 
 Based on such evaluations, our CEO and CFO have concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the SEC, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the CEO and CFO, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 
 Changes in Internal Controls 
 
 No change in our internal controls over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.

 PART II 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings

Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 
 We have disclosed under the heading Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K the risk factors which materially affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. As of November 12, 2024, there have been no material changes from the risk factors previously disclosed. You should carefully consider the risk factors set forth in the Annual Report on Form 10-K and the other information set forth elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. You should be aware that these risk factors and other information may not describe every risk facing our Company. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or operating results. 

Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds 
 
 Stock Repurchase Plans - During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company had no stock repurchases pursuant to any stock repurchase plans.

The Company remits the value, which is based on the closing share price on the vesting date, of the common stock withheld to the appropriate tax authority on behalf of the employee and the related shares become treasury stock. 
 
 Stock repurchases during the three months ended September 30, 2024 were as follows: 
 
 Period (a) Total Number of Shares Purchased (1) 
 (b) Average Price Paid per Share (2) 
 (c) Total Number of Shares Purchased as Part of Publicly Announced Plans or Programs (d) Approximate Dollar Value of Shares that May Yet Be Purchased Under the Plans or Programs July 1 through July 31, 2024 71,076 2.17 August 1 through August 31, 2024 September 1 through September 30, 2024 Total 71,076 
 (1) Total number of shares purchased includes shares withheld to satisfy employee income tax obligations upon the vesting of stock awards.
