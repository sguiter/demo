 Fair value of forward contracts associated with forecasted sales hedges is calculated using the period-end exchange rate adjusted for current forward points. 
 Fair value of hedges against net assets denominated in foreign currencies is calculated at the period-end exchange rate adjusted for current forward points unless the hedge has been traded but not settled at period-end (Level 2). If this is the case, the fair value is calculated at the rate at which the hedge is being settled (Level 1).

 Interest Rate Risk Management 
 The Company is exposed to market risk associated with interest rate payments on its borrowings under a term loan Term Loan A ), Revolving Credit Facility, and Receivables Financing Facilities, which bear interest at variable rates plus applicable margins. The Company manages its exposure to changes in interest rates by issuing both fixed and variable rate borrowings as well as periodically utilizing interest rate swaps to economically hedge interest rate exp osure based on current and projected market conditions.

million cash receipt that is classified within Cash flows from operating activities on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Total cash receipts for the nine months ended September 28, 2024 were million. See Note 9, Long-Term Debt for further details related to the Company s borrowings and interest rate exposure. 
 
 Credit and Market Risk Management 
 Financial instruments, including derivatives, expose the Company to counterparty credit risk of nonperformance and to market risk related to currency exchange rate and interest rate fluctuations. The Company manages its exposure to counterparty credit risk by establishing minimum credit standards, diversifying its counterparties, and monitoring its concentrations of credit. The Company s counterparties are commercial banks with expertise in derivative financial instruments. The Company evaluates the impact of market risk on the fair value and cash flows of its derivative and other financial instruments by considering reasonably possible changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates. The Company continually monitors the creditworthiness of the customers to which it grants credit terms in the normal course of business. The terms and conditions of the Company s credit policies are designed to mitigate concentrations of credit risk. 
 
 The Company s master netting and other similar arrangements with the respective counterparties allow for net settlement under certain conditions, which are designed to reduce credit risk by permitting net settlement with the same counterparty. We present the assets and liabilities of our derivative financial instruments, for which we have net settlement agreements in place, on a net basis on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. If the derivative financial instruments had been presented gross on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, the asset and liability positions would have been significant as of September 28, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
 
 Foreign Currency Exchange Risk Management 
 The Company conducts business on a multinational basis in a variety of foreign currencies. Exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates arises primarily from Euro-denominated external revenues, cross-border financing activities between subsidiaries, and foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities. The Company manages its objective of preserving the economic value of non-functional currency denominated cash flows by initially hedging transaction exposures with natural offsets and, once these opportunities have been exhausted, through foreign exchange forward and option contracts, as deemed appropriate. 
 
 The Company manages the exchange rate risk of anticipated Euro-denominated sales using forward contracts, which typically mature within of execution. The Company designates these derivative contracts as cash flow hedges. Unrealized gains and losses on these contracts are deferred in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) AOCI on the Consolidated Balance Sheets until the contract is settled and the hedged sale is realized. The realized gain or loss is then recorded as an adjustment to Net sales on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Realized amounts reclassified to Net sales were million and million of losses for the three months ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. Realized amounts reclassified to Net sales were million of gains and million of losses for the nine months ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. As of September 28, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the notional amounts of the Company s foreign exchange cash flow hedges were million and million, respectively. The Company has reviewed its cash flow hedges for effectiveness and determined that they are highly effective. 
 
 The Company uses forward contracts, which are not designated as hedging instruments, to manage its exposures related to net assets denominated in foreign currencies. These forward contracts typically mature within after execution. Monetary gains and losses on these forward contracts are recorded in income and are generally offset by the transaction gains and losses related to their net asset positions.

 and , respectively, compared to benefit and expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. In the current periods, the variance from the 21 federal statutory rate was primarily due to the generation of tax credits and the favorable impacts of foreign earnings subject to U.S. taxation, offset partially by U.S. State income taxes and foreign rate differentials. In the prior periods, the difference was primarily due to a discrete tax benefit from the U.S. voluntary retirement plan, U.S. tax credits, and the favorable impacts of foreign earnings subject to U.S. taxation.

 Third Quarter 2024 Financial Summary and Other Recent Developments 
 
 Net sales were 1,255 million in the current quarter compared to 956 million in the prior year. 
 Operating income was 191 million in the current quarter compared to an operating loss of 12 million in the prior year. 
 21 

Table of Contents 

 Net income was 137 million, or 2.64 per diluted share in the current quarter, compared to a net loss of 15 million, or (0.28) per diluted share in the prior year. 
 Net cash provided by operating activities was 707 million for the nine months ended September 28, 2024 as compared to net cash used in operating activities of 145 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 In the current quarter, we saw the continuation of a modest recovery in demand trends that began to broaden across both of our segments. Our third quarter revenues and profitability improved from the first half of the year, and particularly as compared to the prior year which was negatively impacted by broad-based demand declines and distributor inventory reductions. We expect these trends to continue into the fourth quarter. 
 
 The Company completed its actions under the 2022 Productivity Plan in the third quarter. Total charges associated with the 2022 Productivity Plan and the U.S. voluntary retirement plan VRP ), which was completed in 2023, were 127 million, including 4 million recorded in the current quarter. The costs of these actions are classified within Exit and restructuring on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Together, these programs have impacted over 9 of our global employee base and are expected to result in annualized net cost savings of approximately 120 million, primarily within Operating expenses. The Company has realized 110 million in net savings to date, with 50 million in 2023 and an incremental 60 million in the first nine months of 2024.

Foreign currency translation impact represents the difference in results that are attributable to fluctuations in the currency exchange rates used to convert the results for businesses where the functional currency is not the U.S. Dollar. This impact is calculated by translating the current period results at the currency exchange rates used in the comparable prior year period, inclusive of the Company s foreign currency hedging program. 
 
 (2) Consolidated Organic Net sales growth is a non-GAAP financial measure. See the Non-GAAP Measures section at the end of this item. 
 
 Third quarter 2024 compared to third quarter 2023 
 
 Total Net sales increased by 299 million or 31.3 compared to the prior year reflecting growth in both of our segments. The prior year period was negatively impacted by declines in broad-based demand and actions taken by distributors to reduce their on-hand inventory levels. Excluding the effects of currency changes, Consolidated Organic Net sales increased by 30.6 . 
 
 Gross margin increased to 48.8 for the current year compared to 44.7 for the prior year. As compared to the prior year, Gross margin was higher in both of our segments which benefited from volume leverage in the current year. 
 
 Operating expenses for the quarters ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023 were 422 million and 439 million, or 33.6 and 45.9 of Net sales, respectively. Current year Operating expenses were lower than the prior year primarily due to lower Exit and restructuring costs and incremental savings largely attributed to our Exit and restructuring actions, partially offset by higher incentive compensation. The decrease as a percentage of Net sales compared to the prior year reflects the impact of expense leveraging. 
 
 Operating income was 191 million for the current year compared to an operating loss of 12 million in the prior year. The increase was due to higher Gross profit and lower Operating expenses. 
 
 Net income increased compared to the prior year primarily due to higher Operating income, as described above, partially offset by higher Other expense, net. The increase in Other expense, net was primarily due to interest rate swap gains in the prior year and unfavorable changes in Foreign exchange (loss) gain as compared to the prior year.

 The Company s effective tax rates for the three months ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023 were 8.1 expense and 37.5 benefit, respectively. The change in the effective tax rates year over year was primarily due to increased foreign income taxed favorably in the U.S. for the current year, while the prior year included a discrete tax benefit related to the VRP. 
 
 Diluted earnings per share increased to 2.64 as compared to (0.28) in the prior year due to higher Net income. 
 
 Year to date 2024 compared to Year to date 2023 
 
 Total Net sales increased 72 million or 2.0 compared to the prior year reflecting growth in our EVM segment that was largely offset by a decline in our AIT segment as the recovery in demand trends benefited EVM earlier in the current year than AIT. Excluding the effects of currency changes, Consolidated Organic Net sales increased by 1.5 . 
 
 Gross margin increased to 48.4 for the current year compared to 46.9 for the prior year. As compared to the prior year, Gross margin was higher in our EVM segment and lower in our AIT segment. 
 
 Operating expenses for the nine months ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023 were 1,248 million and 1,268 million, or 34.2 and 35.5 of Net sales, respectively. Current year Operating expenses were lower than the prior year primarily due to lower Exit and restructuring costs and incremental savings largely attributed to our Exit and restructuring actions, partially offset by higher incentive compensation. 
 
 Operating income was 517 million for the current year compared to 407 million in the prior year. The increase was due to higher Gross profit and lower Operating expenses. 
 
 Net income increased compared to the prior year primarily due to higher Operating income, as described above, partially offset by higher Other expense, net. The increase in Other expense, net was primarily due to unfavorable changes in Foreign exchange (loss) gain as compared to the prior year and a long-term investment loss in the current year. 
 
 The Company s effective tax rates for the nine months ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023 were 14.5 and 16.0 , respectively. 
 
 Diluted earnings per share increased to 7.04 as compared to 5.40 in the prior year due to higher Net income.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 The primary factors that influence our liquidity include the amount and timing of cash collections from our customers, cash payments to our suppliers, capital expenditures, acquisitions, and share repurchases. Management believes that our existing capital resources, inclusive of available borrowing capacity on debt and other financing facilities and funds generated from operations, are sufficient to meet anticipated capital requirements and service our indebtedness. The following table summarizes our cash flow activities for the periods indicated (in millions):

 New Accounting Pronouncements 
 
 We do not expect any recently issued accounting pronouncements to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 

Non-GAAP Measures 
 
 The Company has provided reconciliations of the supplemental non-GAAP financial measures, as defined under the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, presented herein to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. 
 
 These supplemental non-GAAP financial measures Consolidated Organic Net sales growth, AIT Organic Net sales growth (decline), and EVM Organic Net sales growth are presented because our management evaluates our financial results both including and excluding the effects of business acquisitions and foreign currency translation, as applicable. Management believes that the supplemental non-GAAP financial measures presented provide additional perspective and insights when analyzing the core operating performance of our business from period to period and trends in our historical operating results. These supplemental non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered superior to, as a substitute for, or as an alternative to, and should be considered in conjunction with the GAAP financial measures presented. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 There were no material changes in the Company s market risk during the quarter ended September 28, 2024. For additional information on market risk, refer to Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 
 Management s Report on Disclosure Controls 
 
 Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate disclosure controls as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our management assessed the effectiveness of our disclosure controls as of September 28, 2024. Based on this assessment and those criteria, our management believes that, as of September 28, 2024, our disclosure controls were effective. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 During the quarter ended September 28, 2024, there have been no changes in our internal controls that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 
 Inherent Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls 
 
 Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within Zebra have been prevented or detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Projections of any evaluation of controls effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures.

 Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 In addition to the other information included in this report, you should carefully consider the factors discussed in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, and the factors identified under Safe Harbor in Part I, Item 2 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, which could materially affect our business, financial condition, cash flows, or results of operations. The risks described in the Annual Report are not the only risks facing the Company. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to the Company or that the Company currently considers immaterial also may materially adversely affect its business, financial condition, and/or operating results. There have been no material changes to the risk factors included in our Annual Report for the year ended December 31, 2023, other than as described below. 
 
 Our indebtedness could adversely affect our business. Our indebtedness could have important consequences, including the following: 
 
 We may experience difficulty in satisfying our obligations with respect to our existing indebtedness or future indebtedness; 
 Our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, or general corporate purposes may be impaired; 
 We may be unable to create liens on certain assets to secure debt; 
 Our subsidiary guarantors may not have sufficient assets or cash flow to allow them to guarantee new debt and existing debt; 
 We may be at a competitive disadvantage with reduced flexibility in planning for, or responding to, changing conditions in the industry, including increased competition; and 
 We may be more vulnerable to economic downturns and adverse developments in the business. 
 
 Any or all of the above events or factors could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. The risks that we face based on our outstanding indebtedness may intensify if we incur additional indebtedness or financing obligations in the future. 
 
 We expect to fund our expenses and to pay the principal and interest on our indebtedness from cash flow from operations. Our ability to meet our expenses and to pay principal and interest on our indebtedness when due depends on our future performance and ability to collect cash from our customers, which will be affected by financial, business, economic, and other factors. We will not be able to control many of these factors, such as economic conditions in the markets where we operate and pressure from competitors. 
 
 If our business does not generate sufficient cash flows from operations or if future borrowings are not available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs, we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before the maturity thereof, sell assets, reduce or delay capital investments, or seek to raise additional capital, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our operations. In addition, we may not be able to effect any of these actions, if necessary, on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Our ability to restructure or refinance our indebtedness will depend on the condition of the capital and debt markets and our financial condition at such time. Any refinancing of our indebtedness could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict business operations. The terms of anticipated or future debt instruments may limit or prevent us from taking any of these actions. 
 
 If there were an event of default under any of the agreements relating to our outstanding indebtedness, the holders of the defaulted debt could cause all amounts outstanding with respect to that debt to be due and payable immediately. We cannot assure you that our assets or cash flow would be sufficient to fully repay borrowings under our outstanding debt instruments if accelerated upon an event of default. Further, if we are unable to repay, refinance or restructure our indebtedness under our secured debt, the holders of such debt could proceed against the collateral securing that indebtedness. In addition, any event of default or declaration of acceleration under one debt instrument could also result in an event of default under one or more of our other debt instruments. As a result, any default by us on our indebtedness could have a material adverse effect on our business and could impact our ability to satisfy the obligations in respect of our indebtedness. In addition, an event of default would likely result in a reduction of our credit rating, which could harm our ability to access additional capital on commercially reasonable terms or at all. 
 
 If we experience a significant disruption in our IT systems, our business, reputation, and operating results could be adversely affected. Our business processes depend on our IT systems, and the IT systems and processes of third parties to provide solutions and services, maintain financial records, retain sensitive data such as intellectual property, proprietary business information, and data related to customers, suppliers, and business partners, process orders, manage inventory, process shipments to customers and operate other critical functions. Disruptions to our IT systems from system failures, shutdowns, implementation of new operational systems or software or upgrades to existing systems and software, and other events, including disruptions at our cloud computing, server, systems, and other third party IT service providers, could interfere with our operations, interrupt order processing and shipments, damage customer and business partner relationships, and negatively impact our reputation. Any such event could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, operating results and financial condition, and no assurance can be given that our efforts to reduce the risk of such events will be successful.

Defects or errors in the Company s software products, or third party software included in or upon which our products, solutions and services rely, could harm our reputation, result in significant cost to us, and impair our ability to market such products. Our software, third party software included on our products, solutions or services, or servers and infrastructure may contain undetected errors, defects, or bugs. Although we have not suffered significant harm from any errors, defects, or bugs, we may discover significant errors, defects, or bugs in the future that we may not be able to correct or correct in a timely manner. Any future errors, defects, or bugs found in such software, solutions, services or infrastructure may result in delays in, or loss of market acceptance of, our products, solutions or services; inability to deliver our products, solutions or services; diversion of resources; injury to reputation; increased service and warranty expenses; and payment of damages; which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.
