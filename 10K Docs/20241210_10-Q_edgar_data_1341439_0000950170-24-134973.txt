 Cautionary Note on Forward-Looking Statements 
 For purposes of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (this Quarterly Report), the terms Oracle, we, us and our refer to Oracle Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries. This Quarterly Report contains statements that are not historical in nature, are predictive in nature, or that depend upon or refer to future events or conditions or otherwise contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), and Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act). These include, among other things, statements regarding: 
 our expectation that we may acquire, and realize the anticipated benefits of acquiring, companies, products, services and technologies to further our corporate strategy as compelling opportunities become available; 

our expectation that, on a constant currency basis, our total cloud and license revenues generally will continue to increase due to expected growth in our cloud services and continued demand for our cloud license and on-premise license and license support offerings; 

our expectation that substantially all of our customers will renew their license support contracts upon expiration; 

our expectation that current and expected customer demand will require continued growth in our cloud services and license support expenses in order to increase our existing data center capacity and establish additional data centers in new geographic locations; 

our expectation that our hardware business will have lower operating margins as a percentage of revenues than our cloud and license business; 

our expectation that we will continue to make significant investments in research and development to maintain and improve our current products and service offerings, and our belief that research and development efforts are essential to maintaining our competitive position; 

our expectations regarding the financial performance and long-term potential of one of our investment companies; 

our expectation that our international operations will continue to provide a significant portion of our total revenues and expenses; 

our expectation that the proportion of our cloud services revenues relative to our total revenues will continue to increase; 

the sufficiency of our sources of funding for working capital, capital expenditures, contractual obligations, acquisitions, dividends, stock repurchases, debt repayments and other matters; 

our belief that we have adequately provided under United States (U.S.) generally accepted accounting principles for outcomes related to our tax audits, that the final outcome of our tax-related examinations, agreements or judicial proceedings will not have a material effect on our results of operations, and that our net deferred tax assets will likely be realized in the foreseeable future; 

our belief that the outcome of certain legal proceedings and claims to which we are a party will not, individually or in the aggregate, result in losses that are materially in excess of amounts already recognized, if any; 

the possibility that certain legal proceedings to which we are a party could have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations; 

the timing and amount of expenses we expect to incur; 

the cost savings we expect to realize pursuant to the Fiscal 2024 Oracle Restructuring Plan; 

1 

Table of Contents 

 declarations of future cash dividend payments and the timing and amount of future stock repurchases, including our expectation that the levels of our future stock repurchase activity may be modified in comparison to past periods in order to use available cash for other purposes; 

our ability to predict revenues, particularly certain cloud license and on-premise license revenues and hardware revenues; 

the percentages of remaining performance obligations that we expect to recognize as revenues over respective future periods; 

as well as other statements regarding our future operations, financial condition and prospects, and business strategies. Forward-looking statements may be preceded by, followed by or include the words anticipates, believes, commits, continues, could, endeavors, estimates, expects, goal, intends, is designed to, likely, maintains, may, plans, potential, seeks, shall, should, strives, will and similar expressions. We claim the protection of the safe harbor for forward-looking statements contained in the Exchange Act and the Securities Act for all forward-looking statements. We have based these forward-looking statements on our current expectations and projections about future events. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions about our business that could affect our future results and could cause those results or other outcomes to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in Risk Factors included in documents we file from time to time with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2024 and our other Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q filed or to be filed by us in our fiscal year 2025, which runs from June 1, 2024 to May 31, 2025. 
 We have no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or risks, except to the extent required by applicable securities laws. If we do update one or more forward-looking statements, no inference should be drawn that we will make additional updates with respect to those or other forward-looking statements. New information, future events or risks could cause the forward-looking events we discuss in this Quarterly Report not to occur. You should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which reflect our expectations only as of the date of this Quarterly Report.

Based on the carrying value of our servers and networking equipment as of May 31, 2024, this change in accounting estimate decreased our total operating expenses by million and increased our net income by million, or per both basic and diluted share, for the second quarter of fiscal 2025 and decreased our total operating expenses by million and increased our net income by million, or per both basic and diluted share, for the first half of fiscal 2025.

 billion and billion, respectively. Revenues recognized from performance obligations satisfied in prior periods and impairment losses recognized on our receivables were immaterial in each of the three and six months ended November 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Remaining performance obligations, as defined in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2024, were billion as of November 30, 2024, of which we expect to recognize approximately as revenues over the next , over the subsequent month 13 to month 36 , over the subsequent month 37 to month 60 and the remainder thereafter.

 billion and billion as of November 30, 2024 and May 31, 2024, respectively, and are included in other non-current assets in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets and are subject to periodic credit losses and impairment reviews. Certain of these non-marketable equity securities and related instruments are adjusted for observable price changes from orderly transactions. The majority of the non-marketable investments held as of these dates were with Ampere Computing Holdings LLC (Ampere), a related party entity in which we have an ownership interest of approximately as of November 30, 2024. We follow the equity method of accounting for our investment in Ampere and our share of loss under the equity method of accounting is recorded in the non-operating income (expenses), net line item in our condensed consolidated statements of operations. We also have convertible debt investments in Ampere which, under the terms of an agreement with Ampere and other co-investors, will mature in and are convertible into equity securities at the holder s option under certain circumstances. During the six months ended November 30, 2024, we invested an aggregate of million in convertible debt instruments issued by Ampere. The total carrying value of our investments in Ampere after accounting for losses under the equity method of accounting was billion as of November 30, 2024. In accordance with the terms of an agreement with other co-investors, we are also a counterparty to certain put (exercisable by a co-investor) and call (exercisable by Oracle) options at prices of approximately million to billion, respectively, to acquire additional equity interests in Ampere from our co-investors through . If either of such options is exercised by us or our co-investors, we would obtain control of Ampere and consolidate its results with our results of operations. Ampere has historically generated net loss es.

Total deferred revenues 

Deferred cloud services and license support revenues and deferred hardware revenues substantially represent customer payments made in advance for cloud or support contracts that are typically billed in advance with corresponding revenues generally being recognized ratably or based upon customer usage over the respective contractual periods. Deferred services revenues include prepayments for our services business and revenues for these services are generally recognized as the services are performed. Deferred cloud license and on-premise license revenues typically resulted from customer payments that related to undelivered products and services or specified enhancements. 

billion remained available for stock repurchases pursuant to our stock repurchase program. We repurchased million shares for million during the six months ended November 30, 2024 and million shares for million during the six months ended November 30, 2023 under the stock repurchase program. Our stock repurchase authorization does not have an expiration date and the pace of our repurchase activity will depend on factors such as our working capital needs, our cash requirements for acquisitions and dividend payments, our debt repayment obligations or repurchases of our debt, our stock price and economic and market conditions. Our stock repurchases may be effected from time to time through open market purchases or pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan. Our stock repurchase program may be accelerated, suspended, delayed or discontinued at any time. Dividends on Common Stock In December 2024, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of per share of our outstanding common stock. The dividend is payable on to stockholders of record as of the close of business on . Future declarations of dividends and the establishment of future record and payment dates are subject to the final determination of our Board of Directors. Fiscal 2025 Stock Based Awards Activity and Compensation Expense During the first half of fiscal 2025, we issued million restricted stock-based units (RSUs), substantially all of which were part of our annual stock-based award process and are subject to service-based vesting restrictions. These fiscal 2025 stock-based award issuances were partially offset by stock-based award forfeitures and cancellations of million shares during the first half of fiscal 2025.

and for the three and six months ended November 30, 2024, respectively, and and for the three and six months ended November 30, 2023, respectively. Our net deferred tax assets were billion and billion as of November 30, 2024 and May 31, 2024, respectively. We believe that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets will be realized in the foreseeable future. Realization of our net deferred tax assets is dependent upon our generation of sufficient taxable income in future years in appropriate tax jurisdictions to obtain benefit from the reversal of temporary differences, net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards. The amount of net deferred tax assets considered realizable is subject to adjustment in future periods if estimates of future taxable income change. Domestically, U.S. federal and state taxing authorities are currently examining income tax returns of Oracle and various acquired entities for years through fiscal 2022. Our U.S. federal income tax returns have been examined for all years prior to fiscal 2013 and, with some exceptions, we are no longer subject to audit for those periods. Our U.S. state income tax returns, with some exceptions, have been examined for all years prior to fiscal 2010, and we are no longer subject to audit for those periods. Internationally, tax authorities for numerous non-U.S. jurisdictions are also examining or have examined returns of Oracle and various acquired entities for years through fiscal 2024. Many of the relevant tax years are at an advanced stage in examination or subsequent controversy resolution processes. With some exceptions, we are generally no longer subject to tax examinations in non-U.S. jurisdictions for years prior to fiscal 2001. We are under audit by the IRS and various other domestic and foreign tax authorities with regards to income tax and indirect tax matters and are involved in various challenges and litigation in a number of countries, including, in particular, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Egypt, Germany, India, Indonesia, Israel, Italy, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, South Korea and Spain, where the amounts under controversy are significant. In some, although not all, cases, we have

. We have three businesses cloud and license, hardware and services each of which is comprised of a single operating segment. All three of our businesses market and sell our offerings globally to businesses of many sizes, government agencies, educational institutions and resellers with a worldwide sales force positioned to offer the combinations that best meet customer needs. Our cloud and license business engages in the sale, marketing and delivery of our enterprise applications and infrastructure technologies through cloud and on-premise deployment models including our cloud services and license support offerings; and our cloud license and on-premise license offerings. Cloud services and license support revenues are generated from offerings that are typically contracted with customers directly, billed to customers in advance, delivered to customers over time with our revenue recognition occurring over the contractual terms and renewed by customers upon completion of the contractual terms. Cloud services and license support contracts provide customers with access to the latest updates to the applications and infrastructure technologies as they become available and for which the customer contracted and also include related technical support services over the contractual term. Cloud license and on-premise license revenues represent fees earned from granting customers licenses, generally on a perpetual basis, to use our database and middleware and our applications software products within cloud and on-premise IT environments. We generally recognize revenues at the point in time the software is made available to the customer to download and use, which typically is immediate upon signature of the license contract. In each fiscal year, our cloud and license business contractual activities are typically highest in our fourth fiscal quarter and the related cash flows are typically highest in the following quarter (i.e., in the first fiscal quarter of the next fiscal year) as we receive payments from these contracts. Our hardware business provides infrastructure technologies including Oracle Engineered Systems, servers, storage, industry-specific hardware, operating systems, virtualization, management and other hardware-related software to support diverse IT environments. Our hardware business also offers hardware support, which provides customers with software updates for the software components that are essential to the functionality of their hardware products and can also include product repairs, maintenance services and technical support services that are typically delivered and recognized ratably over the contractual term.

Disaggregation of Revenues We have considered information that is regularly reviewed by our CODMs in evaluating financial performance and disclosures presented outside of our financial statements in our earnings releases and used in investor presentations to disaggregate revenues to depict how the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenues and cash flows are affected by economic factors. The principal category we use to disaggregate revenues is the nature of our products and services as presented in our condensed consolidated statements of operations. The following table is a summary of our total revenues by geographic region:

 . That matter is now concluded. In the Rule 10b-5 class action, plaintiff alleged Oracle and certain Oracle officers made or were responsible for false and misleading statements regarding Oracle s cloud business. Plaintiff in the derivative action filed an amended complaint on June 4, 2021. The derivative suit was brought by an alleged stockholder of Oracle, purportedly on Oracle s behalf, against our Chief Technology Officer, our Chief Executive Officer and the estate of Mark Hurd. Plaintiff claimed that the alleged actions described in the 10b-5 class action caused harm to Oracle, including harming Oracle because Oracle allegedly repurchased its own stock at an inflated price. Plaintiff also claimed that defendants violated their fiduciary duties of candor, good faith, loyalty, and due care by failing to prevent this alleged harm. Plaintiff also brought derivative claims for violations of federal securities laws. Plaintiff sought a ruling that this case may proceed as a derivative action, a finding that defendants are liable for breaching their fiduciary duties, an award of damages to Oracle, an order directing defendants to enact corporate reforms, attorneys fees and costs, and unspecified relief. The parties reached an agreement to settle this case, under which Oracle will implement certain corporate governance measures, which shall remain in place for , and Oracle would pay plaintiffs attorneys fees and costs of no more than . On April 5, 2024, plaintiffs filed a motion for preliminary approval of the proposed settlement. On August 8, 2024, the court held a hearing where it granted plaintiffs motion and preliminarily approved the settlement. On November 14, 2024, the court held a final fairness hearing. No one objected to the settlement, and the court approved the settlement,

 provided for in the settlement. This matter is now concluded. Netherlands Privacy Class Action On August 14, 2020, The Privacy Collective (TPC), a foundation having its registered office in Amsterdam, filed a purported class action lawsuit against Oracle Nederland B.V, Oracle Corporation and Oracle America, Inc. (the Oracle Defendants), Salesforce.com, Inc. and SFDC Netherlands B.V. in the District Court of Amsterdam. TPC alleges that the Oracle Defendants Data Management Platform product violates certain articles of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the Dutch Telecommunications Act (Telecommunicatiewet). TPC claims damages under a number of categories, including: immaterial damages (at a fixed amount of per Dutch internet user); material damages (in that the costs of loss of control over personal data should be equated to the market value of the personal data for parties like the Oracle Defendants); compensation for losses suffered due to an alleged data breach (at a fixed amount of per Dutch internet user); and compensation for the costs of the litigation funder to of the compensation awarded); and the (actual) cost of the proceedings and extrajudicial costs. We filed our defense on March 3, 2021, and on December 29, 2021, the District Court issued a judgment, holding that all of TPC s claims were deemed inadmissible because of fundamental procedural flaws. TPC filed an appeal with the Court of Appeal in Amsterdam challenging the District Court s judgment, except for the claims regarding the alleged data breach, which were dropped. On June 18, 2024, the Court of Appeal overturned the District Court s decision regarding admissibility, thus permitting the case to proceed. We requested that the Court of Appeal permit an interim appeal to the Dutch Supreme Court and/or the European Court of Justice. On September 24, 2024, the Court of Appeal issued a judgment confirming that TPC s claims are admissible and referred the matter back to the District Court of Amsterdam for a decision on the merits of TPC s claims, including TPC s claims for damages under article 82 of the GDPR. The Court of Appeal also granted Oracle s request for an interim appeal to the Supreme Court, appealing the June 18 and the September 24, 2024, judgments. Oracle s appeal is due by December 24, 2024. Once filed, the Supreme Court appeal will suspend proceedings before the District Court. On October 23, 2024, in anticipation of suspended proceedings following such Supreme Court appeal, the District Court effectively stayed proceedings by referring the matter to the special docket session on April 2, 2025. We believe that we have meritorious defenses against this action, including defenses to the quantum of damages claimed, and we will continue to vigorously defend it. While the final outcome of this matter cannot be predicted with certainty and we cannot estimate a range of loss at this time, we do not believe that it will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations. Other Litigation We are party to various other legal proceedings and claims, either asserted or unasserted, which arise in the ordinary course of business, including proceedings and claims that relate to acquisitions we have completed or to companies we have acquired or are attempting to acquire. While the outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not believe that the outcome of any of these matters, individually or in the aggregate, will result in losses that are materially in excess of amounts already recognized, if any.

 Item 2. 	Management s Discussion and Analysis o f Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 We begin Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations with an overview of our businesses and significant trends. This overview is followed by a summary of our critical accounting estimates that we believe are important to understanding significant assumptions and judgments incorporated in our reported financial results. We then provide a more detailed analysis of our results of operations and financial condition. 
 Business Overview 
 Oracle provides products and services that address enterprise information technology (IT) needs. Our products and services include enterprise applications and infrastructure offerings that are delivered worldwide through a variety of flexible and interoperable IT deployment models. These models include on-premise, cloud-based and hybrid deployments (an approach that combines both on-premise and cloud-based deployments). Accordingly, we offer choice and flexibility to our customers and facilitate the product, service and deployment combinations that best suit our customers needs. Through our worldwide sales force and Oracle Partner Network, we sell to customers all over the world including businesses of many sizes, government agencies, educational institutions and resellers. 
 We have three businesses: cloud and license; hardware; and services; each of which comprises a single operating segment. The descriptions set forth below as a part of this Item 2 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and the information contained within Note 8 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report provide additional information related to our businesses and operating segments and align to how our chief operating decision makers (CODMs), which are our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Technology Officer, view our operating results and allocate resources. 
 Cloud and License Business 
 Our cloud and license business, which represented 85 of our total revenues on a trailing 4-quarter basis, markets, sells and delivers a broad spectrum of enterprise applications and infrastructure technologies through our cloud and license offerings. Revenue streams included in our cloud and license business are: 
 Cloud services and license support revenues, which include: 

o cloud services revenues, which are earned by providing customers access to Oracle Cloud applications and infrastructure technologies via cloud-based deployment models that Oracle develops, provides unspecified updates and enhancements for, deploys, hosts, manages and supports and that customers access by entering into a subscription agreement with us for a stated period. Oracle Cloud Applications and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (collectively Oracle Cloud Services) arrangements generally: are billed in advance of the cloud services being delivered; have durations of one to four years; are renewed at the customer s option; and are recognized as revenues ratably over the contractual period of the cloud contract or, in the case of usage model contracts, as the cloud services are consumed over time; and 

o license support revenues, which are earned by providing Oracle license support services to customers that have elected to purchase support services in connection with the purchase of Oracle applications and infrastructure software licenses for use in cloud, on-premise and other IT environments. Substantially all license support customers renew their support contracts with us upon expiration in order to continue to benefit from technical support services and the periodic issuance of unspecified updates and enhancements, which current license support customers are entitled to receive. License support contracts are generally: priced as a percentage of the net fees paid by the customer to purchase a cloud license and/or on-premise license; billed in advance of the support services being performed; renewed at the customer s option; and recognized as revenues ratably over the contractual period that the support services are provided, which is generally one year. 

Cloud license and on-premise license revenues, which include revenues from the licensing of our software products including Oracle Applications, Oracle Database, Oracle Middleware and Java, among others, which our customers deploy within cloud-based, on-premise or other IT environments. Our cloud license and on-premise license transactions are generally perpetual in nature and are generally recognized as revenues up front at the point in time when the software is made available to the customer to download and use. Revenues from usage-based royalty arrangements for distinct cloud licenses and on-premise licenses are 

22 

Table of Contents 

 recognized at the point in time when the software end user usage occurs. The timing of a few large license transactions can substantially affect our quarterly license revenues due to the point-in-time nature of revenue recognition for license transactions, which is different than the typical revenue recognition pattern for our cloud services and license support revenues in which revenues are recognized over time. Cloud license and on-premise license customers have the option to purchase and renew license support contracts, as further described above. 

Providing choice and flexibility to our customers as to when and how they deploy Oracle applications and infrastructure technologies are important elements of our corporate strategy. In recent periods, customer demand for our applications and infrastructure technologies delivered through our Oracle Cloud Services has increased. To address customer demand and enable customer choice, we have certain programs for customers to pivot their applications and infrastructure software licenses and the related license support to the Oracle Cloud for new deployments and to migrate to and expand with the Oracle Cloud for their existing workloads. The proportion of our cloud services revenues relative to our total revenues has increased and we expect this trend to continue. Cloud services revenues represented 42 of our total revenues for each of the three- and six-month periods ended November 30, 2024, and 37 of our total revenues for each of the three- and six-month periods ended November 30, 2023. 
 Our cloud and license business revenue growth is affected by many factors, including the strength of general economic and business conditions; governmental budgetary constraints; the strategy for and competitive position of our offerings; customer satisfaction with our offerings; the continued renewal of our cloud services and license support customer contracts by the customer contract base; substantially all customers continuing to purchase license support contracts in connection with their license purchases; the pricing of license support contracts sold in connection with the sales of licenses; the pricing, amounts and volumes of licenses and cloud services sold; our ability to manage Oracle Cloud capacity requirements to meet existing and prospective customer demand; and foreign currency rate fluctuations. 
 On a constant currency basis, we expect that our total cloud and license revenues generally will continue to increase due to: 
 expected growth in our cloud services offerings; and 

continued demand for our cloud license and on-premise license and license support offerings. 

We believe these factors should contribute to future growth in our cloud and license business total revenues, which should enable us to continue to make investments in research and development and our cloud operations to develop, improve, increase the capacity of and expand the geographic footprint of our cloud and license products and services. 
 Our cloud and license business margin has historically trended upward over the course of the four quarters within a particular fiscal year due to the historical upward trend of our cloud and license business revenues over those quarterly periods and because the majority of our costs for this business are generally fixed in the short term. The historical upward trend of our cloud and license business revenues over the course of the four quarters within a particular fiscal year is primarily due to the addition of new cloud services and license support contracts to the customer contract base that we generally recognize as revenues ratably or based upon customer usage over the respective contractual terms and the renewal of existing customers cloud services and license support contracts over the course of each fiscal year that we generally recognize as revenues in a similar manner; and the historical upward trend of our cloud license and on-premise license revenues, which we generally recognize at a point in time upon delivery; in each case over those four fiscal quarterly periods. 
 Hardware Business 
 Our hardware business, which represented 5 of our total revenues on a trailing 4-quarter basis, provides a broad selection of enterprise hardware products and hardware-related software products including Oracle Engineered Systems, servers, storage, industry-specific hardware offerings, operating systems, virtualization, management and other hardware-related software and related hardware support. Each hardware product and its related software, such as an operating system or firmware, are highly interdependent and interrelated and are accounted for as a combined performance obligation. The revenues for this combined performance obligation are generally recognized 
 23 

Table of Contents 

 at the point in time that the hardware product and its related software are delivered to the customer and ownership is transferred to the customer. We expect to continue to make investments in research and development to improve existing hardware products and services and to develop new hardware products and services. The majority of our hardware products are sold through indirect channels, including independent distributors and value-added resellers. Our hardware support offerings provide customers with unspecified software updates for software components that are essential to the functionality of our hardware products and associated software products. Our hardware support offerings can also include product repairs, maintenance services and technical support services. Hardware support contracts are entered into and renewed at the option of the customer, are generally priced as a percentage of the net hardware products fees and are generally recognized as revenues ratably as the hardware support services are delivered over the contractual terms. 
 We generally expect our hardware business to have lower operating margins as a percentage of revenues than our cloud and license business due to the incremental costs we incur to produce and distribute these products and to provide support services, including direct materials and labor costs. 
 Our quarterly hardware revenues are difficult to predict. Our hardware revenues, cost of hardware and hardware operating margins that we report are affected by many factors, including our manufacturing partners abilities to timely manufacture or deliver a few large hardware transactions; our strategy for and the position of our hardware products relative to competitor offerings; customer demand for competing offerings, including cloud infrastructure offerings; the strength of general economic and business conditions; governmental budgetary constraints; whether customers decide to purchase hardware support contracts at or in close proximity to the time of hardware product sale; the percentage of our hardware support contract customer base that renews its support contracts; and the close association between hardware products, which have a finite life, and customer demand for related hardware support as hardware products age; customer decisions to either maintain or upgrade their existing hardware infrastructure to newly developed technologies that are available; and foreign currency rate fluctuations. 
 Services Business 
 Our services business, which represented 10 of our total revenues on a trailing 4-quarter basis, helps customers and partners maximize the performance of their investments in Oracle applications and infrastructure technologies. We believe that our services are differentiated based on our focus on Oracle technologies, extensive experience, broad sets of intellectual property and best practices. Our services offerings include consulting services and advanced customer services. Our services business has lower margins than our cloud and license and hardware businesses. Our services revenues are affected by many factors including our strategy for, and the competitive position of, our services; customer demand for our cloud and license and hardware offerings and the related services that we may market and sell in connection with these offerings; general economic conditions; governmental budgetary constraints; personnel reductions in our customers IT departments; tighter controls over customer discretionary spending; and foreign currency rate fluctuations. 
 Acquisitions 
 Our selective and active acquisition program is another important element of our corporate strategy. Historically, we have invested billions of dollars to acquire a number of complementary companies, products, services and technologies. As compelling opportunities become available, we may acquire companies, products, services and technologies in furtherance of our corporate strategy. 
 We believe that we can fund our future acquisitions with our internally available cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances, cash generated from operations, additional borrowings or from the issuance of additional securities. We estimate the financial impact of any potential acquisition with regard to earnings, operating margin, cash flows and return on invested capital targets, among others, before deciding to move forward with an acquisition.

 Investment in Ampere Computing Holdings LLC 
 From time to time since 2017, we have made investments in Ampere Computing Holdings LLC (Ampere), a related party entity, in the form of equity and convertible debt instruments. The total carrying value of our investments in Ampere, after accounting for losses under the equity method of accounting, was 1.5 billion as of November 30, 2024. We currently expect Ampere to continue to generate net losses in future periods, but we remain confident in the long-term potential of Ampere s server chips. 
 Our equity investments in Ampere represent an ownership interest of approximately 29 as of November 30, 2024. We also own convertible debt investments in Ampere which, under the terms of an agreement with Ampere and other co-investors, will mature in June 2026 and are convertible into equity securities at the holder s option under certain circumstances. During the six months ended November 30, 2024, we invested an aggregate of 135 million in convertible debt instruments issued by Ampere. In accordance with the terms of an agreement with other co-investors, we are also a counterparty to certain put (exercisable by a co-investor) and call (exercisable by Oracle) options at prices of approximately 450 million to 1.5 billion, respectively, to acquire additional equity interests in Ampere from our co-investors through January 2027. If either of such options is exercised by us or our co-investors, we would obtain control of Ampere and consolidate its results with our results of operations. 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), which requires us to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions that can affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, and related disclosure. Critical accounting estimates are those estimates that involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and have had, or are reasonably likely to have, a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. We believe that the estimates, judgments and assumptions upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time that these estimates, judgments and assumptions are made. To the extent that there are differences between these estimates, judgments or assumptions and actual results, our financial statements will be affected. We have critical accounting estimates in the areas of business combinations, income taxes and non-marketable investments. 
 During the first quarter of fiscal 2025, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our servers and increased the estimated useful lives from five years to six years, effective at the beginning of fiscal 2025. Refer to Note 1 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report for more information. There were no other significant changes to our critical accounting estimates. Refer to Critical Accounting Estimates under Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contained in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2024 for a more complete discussion of our critical accounting estimates. 
 Results of Operations 
 Presentation of Operating Segment Results and Other Financial Information 
 In our results of operations discussion below, we provide an overview of our total consolidated revenues, total consolidated operating expenses and total consolidated operating margin, all of which are presented on a GAAP basis. We also present a GAAP-based discussion below for substantially all of the other expense items as presented in our condensed consolidated statements of operations that are not directly attributable to our three businesses. 
 In addition, we discuss below the results of each of our three businesses cloud and license, hardware and services which are our operating segments as defined pursuant to ASC 280, Segment Reporting . The financial reporting for our three businesses that is presented below is presented in a manner that is consistent with that used by our CODMs. Our operating segment presentation below reflects revenues, direct costs and sales and marketing expenses that correspond to and are directly attributable to each of our three businesses. We also utilize these inputs to calculate and present a segment margin for each of our three businesses in the discussion below. 
 Consistent with our internal management reporting processes, research and development expenses, general and administrative expenses, stock-based compensation expenses, amortization of intangible assets, certain other expense allocations, acquisition related and other expenses, restructuring expenses, interest expense, non-operating income (expenses), net and provision for income taxes are not attributed to our three operating segments 
 25 

Table of Contents 

 because our management does not view the performance of our three businesses including such items and/or it is impracticable to do so. Refer to Supplemental Disclosure Related to Certain Charges below for additional discussion of certain of these items and Note 8 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report for a reconciliation of the summations of total segment margin as presented in the discussion below to total income before income taxes as presented per our condensed consolidated statements of operations for all periods presented. 
 Constant Currency Presentation 
 Our international operations have provided, and are expected to continue to provide, a significant portion of each of our businesses revenues and expenses. As a result, each of our businesses revenues and expenses and our total revenues and expenses will continue to be affected by changes in the U.S. Dollar against major international currencies. In order to provide a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed, excluding the effects of foreign currency rate fluctuations, we compare the percent change in the results from one period to another period in this Quarterly Report using constant currency. To present this information, current and comparative prior period results for entities reporting in currencies other than U.S. Dollars are converted into U.S. Dollars at constant exchange rates (i.e., the rates in effect on May 31, 2024, which was the last day of our prior fiscal year) rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during the respective periods. For example, if an entity reporting in Euros had revenues of 1.0 million Euros from products sold on November 30, 2024 and 2023, our financial statements would reflect reported revenues of 1.06 million in the first half of fiscal 2025 (using 1.06 as the applicable average exchange rate for the period) and 1.10 million in the first half of fiscal 2024 (using 1.10 as the applicable average exchange rate for the period). The constant currency presentation, however, would translate the results for each of the first half of fiscal 2025 and 2024 using the May 31, 2024 exchange rate and indicate, in this example, no change in revenues between the periods compared. In each of the tables below, we present the percent change based on actual, unrounded results in reported currency and in constant currency.

Total revenues increased by 1.1 billion and 2.0 billion in reported currency in the second quarter and the first half of fiscal 2025, respectively, relative to the corresponding prior year periods, due to a 1.2 billion and a 2.2 billion increase in cloud and license revenues, partially offset by a 28 million and an 87 million decrease in hardware

 revenues and a 38 million and a 157 million decrease in services revenues, in each case during the second quarter and the first half of fiscal 2025, respectively, relative to the corresponding prior year periods. Excluding the unfavorable effects of foreign currency rate fluctuations of less than 1 in the second quarter of fiscal 2025 and 1 in the first half of fiscal 2025, the increase in our cloud and license business revenues was primarily due to growth in our cloud services revenues as customers purchased our applications and infrastructure technologies and also renewed their related cloud contracts to continue to gain access to the latest versions of our technologies. In constant currency, applications cloud services and license support contributed 25 and 28 and infrastructure cloud services and license support contributed 75 and 72 of the growth in cloud services and license support revenues, in each case in the second quarter and the first half of fiscal 2025, respectively. In our hardware business, the constant currency decrease in revenues in the fiscal 2025 periods presented was due to the emphasis we placed on the marketing and sale of our growing cloud-based infrastructure technologies. In our services business, the constant currency decrease in revenues in the fiscal 2025 periods presented was attributable to a decrease in revenues from each of our primary services offerings. The Americas region contributed 82 and 74 , the EMEA region contributed 15 and 18 and the Asia Pacific region contributed 3 and 8 to the constant currency total revenue growth during the second quarter and the first half of fiscal 2025, respectively. 
 Total GAAP operating expenses increased by 520 million and 679 million in reported currency in the second quarter and the first half of fiscal 2025, respectively, relative to the corresponding prior year periods. The increase in GAAP operating expenses in reported currency was primarily due to a 472 million and an 892 million increase in cloud services and license support expenses primarily due to higher infrastructure expenses and higher employee related expenses, including higher expenses relating to stock-based compensation, that were incurred to support the growth in our cloud services revenues; a 245 million and a 335 million increase in research and development expenses primarily due to higher employee related expenses, including higher stock-based compensation expenses; and a 97 million and a 108 million increase in sales and marketing expenses, in each case during the second quarter and the first half of fiscal 2025, respectively, relative to the corresponding prior year periods. These increases in GAAP operating expenses in reported currency were partially offset by a 164 million and a 303 million decrease in expenses for the amortization of intangible assets as certain of our assets were fully amortized; an 86 million and a 151 million decrease in services expenses primarily due to lower bad debt expenses and lower external contractor expenses; and a 41 million and a 99 million decrease in hardware expenses due to lower hardware product and support costs, in each case during the second quarter and the first half of fiscal 2025, respectively, relative to the corresponding prior year periods. A 65 million decrease in restructuring expenses, relative to the corresponding prior year period, further offset the increase in operating expenses in the first half of fiscal 2025. 
 In constant currency, our total operating margin and total operating margin as a percentage of revenues increased in the fiscal 2025 periods presented, relative to the corresponding prior year periods, due to higher revenues.

Cloud and License Business 
 Our cloud and license business engages in the sale and marketing of our applications and infrastructure technologies that are delivered through various deployment models and include: Oracle Cloud Services offerings; Oracle cloud license and on-premise license offerings; and Oracle license support offerings. Our cloud services deliver applications and infrastructure technologies on a subscription basis via cloud-based deployment models that we develop, provide unspecified updates and enhancements for, deploy, host, manage and support. Revenues for our cloud services are generally recognized ratably over the contractual term, which is generally one to four years, or in the case of usage model contracts, as the cloud services are consumed. Cloud license and on-premise license revenues represent fees earned from granting customers licenses, generally on a perpetual basis, to use our database and middleware and our applications software products within cloud and on-premise IT environments and are generally recognized up front at the point in time when the software is made available to the customer to download and use. License support revenues are typically generated through the sale of applications and infrastructure software license support contracts related to cloud licenses and on-premise licenses; are purchased by our customers at their option; and are generally recognized as revenues ratably over the contractual term, which is generally one year. We continue to place significant emphasis, both domestically and internationally, on direct sales through our own sales force. We also continue to market certain of our offerings through indirect channels. Costs associated with our cloud and

The Americas region contributed 83 and 77 , the EMEA region contributed 14 and 16 and the Asia Pacific region contributed 3 and 7 to the constant currency revenue growth for this business during the second quarter and the first half of fiscal 2025, respectively. 
 Total cloud and license business expenses increased by 541 million and 909 million in reported currency in the second quarter and the first half of fiscal 2025, respectively, relative to the corresponding prior year periods. Excluding the favorable effects of currency rate fluctuations of less than 1 in each of the second quarter and the first half of fiscal 2025, the increase in expenses was primarily due to a 307 million and a 561 million increase in infrastructure expenses, a 108 million and a 184 million increase in employee related expenses for employees engaged in cloud services delivery and a 93 million and a 92 million increase in sales and marketing expenses, in

 each case in the second quarter and the first half of fiscal 2025, respectively, relative to the corresponding prior year periods, to support the increase in our cloud services revenues. Our cloud services and license support expenses have grown in recent periods, and we expect this trend to continue during fiscal 2025 as we increase our existing data center capacity and establish data centers in new geographic locations in order to meet current and expected customer demand. 
 Excluding the effects of currency rate fluctuations, our cloud and license business total margin increased in the fiscal 2025 periods presented, relative to the corresponding prior year periods, due to increases in total revenues for this business. In constant currency, total margin as a percentage of revenues decreased in the fiscal 2025 periods presented, relative to the corresponding prior year periods, due to an increase in total expenses for this business. 
 Hardware Business 
 Our hardware business revenues are generated from the sales of our Oracle Engineered Systems, server, storage and industry-specific hardware offerings. The hardware product and related software, such as an operating system or firmware, are highly interdependent and interrelated and are accounted for as a combined performance obligation. The revenues for this combined performance obligation are generally recognized at the point in time that the hardware product is delivered to the customer and ownership is transferred to the customer. Our hardware business also earns revenues from the sale of hardware support contracts purchased by our customers at their option and that are generally recognized as revenues ratably as the hardware support services are delivered over the contractual term, which is generally one year. The majority of our hardware products are sold through indirect channels such as independent distributors and value-added resellers and we also market and sell our hardware products through our direct sales force. Operating expenses associated with our hardware business include the cost of hardware products, which consists of expenses for materials and labor used to produce these products by our internal manufacturing operations or by third-party manufacturers, warranty and related expenses and the impact of periodic changes in inventory valuation, including the impact of inventory determined to be excess and obsolete; the cost of materials used to repair customer products with eligible support contracts; the cost of labor and infrastructure to provide support services; and sales and marketing expenses, which are largely personnel related and include variable compensation earned by our sales force for the sales of our hardware offerings.

Amortization of intangible assets decreased by 164 million and 303 million in reported currency in the second quarter and the first half of fiscal 2025, respectively, relative to the corresponding prior year periods, due to a reduction in expenses associated with certain of our intangible assets that became fully amortized. 
 Acquisition Related and Other Expenses : Acquisition related and other expenses consist of personnel related costs for transitional and certain other employees, certain business combination adjustments, including adjustments after the measurement period has ended, and certain other operating items, net.

Acquisition related and other expenses decreased by 16 million and 14 million in reported currency in the second quarter and the first half of fiscal 2025, respectively, relative to the corresponding prior year periods. The decrease in the second quarter of fiscal 2025 and the first half of fiscal 2025 was due to a 13 million and an 18 million decrease, respectively, in business combination adjustments, net and a 5 million and a 9 million decrease, respectively, in transitional and other employee related costs, partially offset by a 2 million and a 13 million increase, respectively, in other expenses primarily related to certain asset impairment charges, in each case relative to the corresponding prior year period. 
 Restructuring Expenses : Restructuring expenses resulted from the execution of management-approved restructuring plans that were generally developed to improve our cost structure and/or operations, often in conjunction with our acquisition integration strategies and/or other strategic initiatives. Restructuring expenses consist of employee severance costs, contract termination costs and certain other exit costs to improve our cost structure prospectively. For additional information regarding our restructuring plans, see Note 4 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report and Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2024.

 Restructuring expenses in each of the fiscal 2025 and 2024 periods presented primarily related to the 2024 Restructuring Plan. Our management approved, committed to and initiated the 2024 Restructuring Plan in order to restructure and further improve efficiencies in our operations. We may incur additional restructuring expenses in future periods due to the initiation of new restructuring plans or from changes in estimated costs associated with existing restructuring plans. 
 The majority of the initiatives undertaken by the 2024 Restructuring Plan were effected to implement our continued emphasis in developing, marketing, selling and delivering our cloud-based offerings. Certain of the cost savings realized pursuant to the 2024 Restructuring Plan initiatives were offset by investments in resources and geographies that we believe better address the development, marketing, sale and delivery of our cloud-based offerings, including investments in the development and delivery of our second-generation cloud infrastructure.

Interest expense decreased in the fiscal 2025 periods presented, relative to the corresponding prior year periods, primarily due to 4.0 billion and 3.5 billion of scheduled repayments of senior notes made during the first half of fiscal 2025 and full year of fiscal 2024, respectively, partially offset by higher interest expense that resulted from the issuance of 6.3 billion of senior notes in September 2024. Refer to Note 3 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report for additional information. 
 
 Non-Operating Income (Expenses), net : Non-operating income (expenses), net consists primarily of interest income, net foreign currency exchange losses, the noncontrolling interests in the net profits of our majority-owned subsidiaries (primarily Oracle Financial Services Software Limited and Oracle Corporation Japan), net losses related to equity investments, including losses attributable to equity method investments (primarily Ampere) and net other income and expenses, including net unrealized gains and losses from our investment portfolio related to our deferred compensation plan and non-service net periodic pension income and losses.

Non-operating income, net increased in the second quarter and the first half of fiscal 2025 primarily due to higher other income, net, of 46 million and 44 million, respectively, which was primarily attributable to unrealized investment gains associated with certain marketable equity securities that we held for employee benefit plans, and for which an equal and offsetting amount was recorded to our operating expenses during the same period, a decrease in foreign currency losses of 23 million and 54 million, respectively, and an increase in interest income of 16 million and 14 million, respectively, in each case relative to the corresponding prior year period. Losses from equity investments increased by 29 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2025 and decreased by 20 million for the first half of fiscal 2025, in each case relative to the corresponding prior year period.

 Provision for Income Taxes : Our effective income tax rates for each of the periods presented were the result of the mix of income earned and losses incurred in various tax jurisdictions that apply a broad range of income tax rates. Refer to Note 7 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report for a discussion regarding the differences between the effective income tax rates as presented for the periods below and the U.S. federal statutory income tax rates that were in effect during these periods. Future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by an unfavorable shift of earnings weighted to jurisdictions with higher tax rates, by unfavorable changes in tax laws and regulations, by adverse rulings in tax related litigation, or by shortfalls in stock-based compensation realized by employees relative to stock-based compensation that was recorded for book purposes, among others.

Fiscal Second Quarter 2025 Compared to Fiscal Second Quarter 2024 : Provision for income taxes increased during the second quarter of fiscal 2025, relative to the second quarter of fiscal 2024, primarily due to the absence of the revaluation benefit of net deferred tax assets due to a change in tax rate of 105 million and the realization of a one-time tax attribute of 49 million, an unfavorable jurisdictional mix of earnings of 99 million and a higher income before provision for income taxes of 53 million, partially offset by an increase in tax benefits related to stock-based compensation of 295 million. 
 First Half of Fiscal 2025 Compared to First Half of Fiscal 2024 : Provision for income taxes increased during the first half of fiscal 2025, relative to the first half of fiscal 2024, primarily due to an unfavorable jurisdictional mix of earnings of 314 million, the absence of the revaluation benefit of net deferred tax assets due to a change in tax rate of 105 million and the realization of a one-time tax attribute of 49 million, partially offset by tax benefits related to stock-based compensation of 168 million and 53 million of tax benefits associated with settlements with taxing authorities and other events.

Working capital : The increase in working capital as of November 30, 2024 in comparison to May 31, 2024 was primarily due to favorable impacts to our net current assets resulting from net income during the first half of fiscal 2025 and proceeds from the issuance of senior notes in September 2024, net of issuance costs, of 6.2 billion (refer to Note 3 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report for additional information), partially offset by 6.3 billion of cash used for capital expenditures, 2.2 billion of cash used to pay dividends to our stockholders, 750 million and 1.0 billion of long-term senior notes that were reclassified to current liabilities, 591 million of net cash used for our employee stock programs, 300 million of cash used for repurchases of our common stock and 137 million of cash used for purchases, net of sales and maturities of non-marketable investments during the first half of fiscal 2025. Our working capital may be impacted by some or all of the aforementioned factors in future periods, the amounts and timing of which are variable. 
 Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities : Cash and cash equivalents primarily consist of deposits held at major banks, money market funds and other securities with original maturities of 90 days or less. Marketable securities consist of time deposits, marketable equity securities and certain other securities with original maturities at the time of purchase greater than 90 days. The increase in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities as of November 30, 2024 in comparison to May 31, 2024 was primarily due to cash inflows from our operations during the first half of fiscal 2025 and proceeds from the issuance of senior notes in September 2024, net of issuance costs, of 6.2 billion. This increase was partially offset by 6.3 billion of cash used for capital expenditures, 4.5 billion of cash used for scheduled repayments of borrowings and commercial paper notes, 2.2 billion of cash used to pay dividends to our stockholders, 591 million of net cash used for our employee stock programs, 300 million of cash

Cash flows from operating activities : Our largest source of operating cash flows is cash collections from our customers following the purchase and renewal of their cloud services and license support agreements. Customers for these cloud services and license support agreements are generally billed in advance of services being provided. Over the course of a fiscal year, we also generate cash from the sales of new licenses, hardware offerings and other services. Our primary uses of cash from operating activities are typically for employee related expenditures, material and manufacturing costs related to the production of our hardware products, taxes, interest payments and leased facilities. 
 Net cash provided by operating activities increased by 1.6 billion in the first half of fiscal 2025, relative to the first half of fiscal 2024, primarily due to higher net income adjusted for certain non-cash charges, partially offset by certain cash unfavorable working capital changes, net. 
 Cash flows from investing activities : The changes in cash flows from investing activities primarily relate to our acquisitions, purchases, maturities and sales of our investments in marketable securities and other instruments and investments in capital assets primarily to support the growth in our cloud and license business. 
 Net cash used for investing activities increased by 3.7 billion in the first half of fiscal 2025, relative to the first half of fiscal 2024, primarily due to the increase in capital expenditures. 
 Cash flows from financing activities : The changes in cash flows from financing activities primarily relate to borrowings and repayments related to our debt instruments, stock repurchases, dividend payments and net proceeds related to employee stock programs. 
 Net cash used for financing activities decreased by 4.2 billion in the first half of fiscal 2025, relative to the first half of fiscal 2024, primarily due to proceeds from the issuance of senior notes in September 2024, net of issuance costs, of 6.2 billion, lower net cash used for our employee stock programs of 716 million and lower net cash used for repurchases of common stock of 300 million, partially offset by higher repayments of commercial paper notes of 2.1 billion, net of issuances, higher scheduled repayments of borrowings of 570 million and higher net cash used for other activities of 338 million, in each case in the first half of fiscal 2025 relative to the first half of fiscal 2024. Further, during the first half of fiscal 2025, we refinanced our Term Loan Credit Agreement (defined below), which resulted in no net impact on financing cash flows for the periods reported. 
 Free cash flow : To supplement our statements of cash flows presented on a GAAP basis, we use non-GAAP measures of cash flows on a trailing 4-quarter basis to analyze cash flows generated from our operations. We believe that free cash flow is also useful as one of the bases for comparing our performance with that of our competitors. The presentation of non-GAAP free cash flow is not meant to be considered in isolation or as an alternative to net income as an indicator of our performance, or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity. We calculate free cash flow as follows:

 Recent Financing Activities : 
 Term Loan Credit Agreements : On June 10, 2024, we terminated our term loan credit agreement that we entered into in fiscal 2023 and repaid the principal amount outstanding together with interest accrued up to the date of repayment. Simultaneously, we borrowed up to the maximum commitment amount of 5.6 billion pursuant to a term loan credit agreement (Term Loan Credit Agreement) executed on the same date. Any remaining unpaid principal balance under the Term Loan Credit Agreement will become fully due and payable on August 16, 2027, unless the termination date of Term Loan Credit Agreement is extended. Refer to Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2024 for additional details about our borrowings. 
 Senior Notes : In September 2024, we issued 6.3 billion of senior notes comprised of the following: 
 1.5 billion of 4.20 senior notes due September 2029; 

1.75 billion of 4.70 senior notes due September 2034; 

1.75 billion of 5.375 senior notes due September 2054; and 

1.25 billion of 5.50 senior notes due September 2064. 

We issued the senior notes to repay all or a portion of 2.0 billion of senior notes due November 2024, 3.5 billion of senior notes due April 2025 and 2.5 billion of senior notes due May 2025 and to pay accrued interest and any related premiums, fees and expenses in connection therewith; to repay all or a portion of commercial paper notes outstanding; and to use any remaining net proceeds from the borrowing for general corporate purposes, which may include stock repurchases, payment of cash dividend on our common stock, repayment of other indebtedness and future acquisitions. Refer to Note 3 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report for additional information. 
 Contractual Obligations : During the first half of fiscal 2025, there were no significant changes to our estimates of future payments under our fixed contractual obligations and commitments as presented in Part II, Item 7 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2024, other than an increase in our operating lease commitments to 36.7 billion as of November 30, 2024. Our operating lease commitments, which are primarily for data centers, are generally expected to commence between the remainder of fiscal 2025 and fiscal 2027 and for terms of nine to fifteen years. We have not recorded these lease commitments on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as of November 30, 2024. Refer to Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2024 for more information about our lease commitments. Additionally, as discussed above, we issued 6.3 billion of senior notes in September 2024 with various maturity dates. 
 We believe that our current cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances, cash generated from operations, and our borrowing arrangements will be sufficient to meet our working capital, capital expenditures and contractual obligations requirements. In addition, we believe that we could fund our future acquisitions, dividend payments and repurchases of common stock or debt with our internally available cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, cash generated from operations, additional borrowings or from the issuance of additional securities. 
 Stock-Based Awards 
 Our stock-based compensation program is a key component of the compensation package we provide to attract and retain certain of our talented employees and align their interests with the interests of existing stockholders. 
 We recognize that stock-based awards dilute existing stockholders and have sought to control the number of stock-based awards granted while providing competitive compensation packages. Consistent with these dual goals, our cumulative potential dilution since June 1, 2021 has been an annualized rate of 1.8 per year. The potential dilution percentage is calculated as the average annualized new stock-based awards granted and assumed, net of stock-based awards forfeited by employees leaving the company, divided by the weighted-average outstanding shares during the calculation period. This maximum potential dilution will only result if all stock-based awards vest and, if 
 37 

Table of Contents 

 applicable, are exercised. Of the outstanding stock options as of November 30, 2024, which generally have a ten-year exercise period, all have exercise prices lower than the market price of our common stock on such date. In recent years, our stock repurchase program has substantially offset the dilutive effect of our stock-based compensation program. However, we may modify the levels of our stock repurchases in the future depending on a number of factors, including the amount of cash we have available for acquisitions, to pay dividends, to repay or repurchase indebtedness or for other purposes. As of November 30, 2024, the maximum potential dilution from all outstanding stock-based awards, regardless of when granted and regardless of whether vested or unvested, was 6.1 .

 Item 3.	Quantitative and Qualitat ive Disclosures About Market Risk 
 There were no significant changes to our quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk during the first half of fiscal 2025. Please refer to Part II, Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2024 for a more complete discussion of the market risks we encounter. 
 Item 4.	Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures: Based on our management s evaluation (with the participation of our Principal Executive and Financial Officer), as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report, our Principal Executive and Financial Officer has concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) were effective to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by us in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and is accumulated and communicated to our management (including our Principal Executive and Financial Officer) as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting: There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Exchange Act Rules 13a-15 or 15d-15 that occurred during our last fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls: Our management, including our Principal Executive and Financial Officer, believes that our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and are effective at the reasonable assurance level. However, our management does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well-conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.

 Item 1A.	Ri sk Factors 
 In addition to the other information set forth in this Quarterly Report, you should carefully consider the factors discussed in Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2024. The risks discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K could materially affect our business, financial condition and future results. The risks described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K are not the only risks facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be insignificant also may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or operating results in the future. 
 Item 2.	Unregistered Sales of Equ ity Securities and Use of Proceeds 
 Our Board of Directors has approved a program for us to repurchase shares of our common stock. As of November 30, 2024, approximately 6.7 billion remained available for stock repurchases pursuant to our stock repurchase program. 
 Our stock repurchase authorization does not have an expiration date and the pace of our repurchase activity will depend on factors such as our working capital needs, our cash requirements for acquisitions and dividend payments, our debt repayment obligations or repurchases of our debt, our stock price, and economic and market conditions. Our stock repurchases may be effected from time to time through open market purchases or pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan. Our stock repurchase program may be accelerated, suspended, delayed or discontinued at any time. 
 The following table summarizes the stock repurchase activity for the three months ended November 30, 2024 and the approximate dollar value of shares that may yet be purchased pursuant to our stock repurchase program:
