Item 2. 
 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

Overview 

Go Go Buyers specializes in two API integration services:
API Flights and API Hotels. API Flights provides users with real-time flight price tracking from various suppliers, along with comprehensive
airport schedule data and flight tracking features. API Hotels utilizes artificial intelligence to generate and compare hotel prices from
a wide range of suppliers. Both services are accessible through our website https://gogobuyers.com/. 

In addition to our API services, we operate a forum
where users can connect to place orders, make requests, and engage with travelers. Users can select a traveler from a list of countries
to initiate a chat and arrange for item delivery. This platform aims to facilitate global connections and assist users in transporting
items between locations. 

Our ongoing development efforts focus on enhancing
user communication and platform usability. In September 2024, we introduced the Flight Calculator API, a powerful tool for calculating
air distances and flight times between any airports worldwide. This innovative solution empowers travelers, businesses, and aviation professionals
to plan journeys with precision and optimize routes for efficiency. With Flight Calculator, users can make informed decisions and streamline
travel planning processes effortlessly. The Flight Calculator API is accessible through our website https://api.gogobuyers.com/demo. 

The principal office of the Company is located at
5348 Vegas Drive, Las Vegas, NV 89108. Our telephone number is +15305394950. 

API Packages 

API Flights offers a comprehensive solution for tracking
flight prices and accessing vital flight information. Powered by artificial intelligence, our software monitors prices from multiple suppliers,
ensuring users find the best deals available. Our APIs provide access to airport schedules, flight tracking details (including departure
and arrival times, dates, terminals, and current status), and more. With competitive pricing and over 1,000,000 request credits, API Flights
is the go-to solution for finding flights at the right price. 

API Hotels delivers top-notch hotel pricing services
powered by artificial intelligence. Our software generates competitive hotel prices, enabling hoteliers to offer timely discounts through
customizable search algorithms for competitors. With access to a vast database of hotels, users can search for any hotel based on location,
date, and number of guests. Flexible pricing options and 50,000 calls per month make API Hotels the best choice for accessing the best
hotel offers. Both of the services can be accessed via our website: https://gogobuyers.com/#tariffs.

Marketing 

Digital marketing as the primary tactic to engage
the audience. During the initial phases of development, our focus lies in investing in promotion through diverse social media channels
and search engine optimization. This approach aims to amplify our presence in user search queries centered around pertinent keywords.
By adhering to this approach, we expect to capture the interest of prospective clientele, whom we designate as "platform users"
or simply "users". Moreover, we intend to employ conventional methods such as direct calls and mailings featuring business propositions,
alongside mentions of our platform and social media profiles. To allure potential platform users, we intend to secure advertising placements
on reputable websites associated with delivery services. As we delve deeper into investments, we aim to produce promotional videos pertaining
to delivery and shipping for marketing purposes. With the expansion of our business, we may contemplate launching a television advertising
campaign. 

Clients 

We expect that both small businesses and individuals
will sign up on our platform, using it to connect with potential clients and boost their visibility. Developing businesses may find our
platform attractive for accessing their target audience. Individuals can conveniently search for cost-effective delivery options due to
our online service. Additionally, we foresee increased competition in the industry as rival companies monitor each other, leading to better
offers for our clients. 

Government Regulation 

The Company will be required to comply with all regulations,
rules, and directives of governmental authorities including the US Securities and Exchange Commission and agencies applicable to our business
in any jurisdiction with which we would conduct activities. The Company does not believe that governmental regulations will have a material
impact on the way we conduct our business. 

Employees 

Go Go Buyers has no employees other than our sole
President and Director Mr. Saladzius.

Limited Operating History
and Need for Additional Capital 

There is no historical financial
information about us upon which to base an evaluation of our performance. We are in start-up stage operations and have generated limited
revenues. Our business is subject to risks inherent in the establishment of a new business enterprise, including limited capital resources
and possible cost overruns due to price and cost increases in services and products. 

We have no assurance that
future financing will be available to us on acceptable terms. If financing is not available on satisfactory terms, we may be unable to
continue, develop or expand our operations. Equity financing could result in additional dilution to existing shareholders.

Controls and Procedures
