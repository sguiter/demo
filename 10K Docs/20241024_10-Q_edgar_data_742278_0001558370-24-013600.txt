The facility contains customary terms and conditions, including restrictions on indebtedness, dividend payments, business combinations and other related items. The revolving credit facility includes a full and unconditional guarantee by the Company's 100 owned domestic subsidiaries whose assets equal substantially all of the consolidated assets of the Company and its subsidiaries. The Credit Agreement has a maturity date of June 22, 2027. The Credit Agreement contains financial covenants. When RPC s trailing four quarter EBITDA (as calculated under the Credit Agreement) is equal to or greater than million: (i) the consolidated leverage ratio cannot exceed :1.00 and (ii) the debt service coverage ratio must be equal to or greater than :1.00; otherwise, the minimum tangible net worth must be greater than or equal to million. As of September 30, 2024, the Company was in compliance with all covenants. Revolving loans under the amended revolving credit facility bear interest at one of the following two rates at the Company s election: Term SOFR; plus, a margin ranging from to , based on a quarterly consolidated leverage ratio calculation, and an additional SOFR Adjustment ranging from to depending upon maturity length; or the Base Rate, which is a fluctuating rate per annum equal to the highest of (a) the Federal Funds Rate plus , (b) Bank of America s publicly announced, prime rate, (c) the Term SOFR plus , or (d) ; in each case plus a margin that ranges from to based on a quarterly consolidated leverage ratio calculation. 
 In addition, the Company pays an annual fee ranging from to , based on a quarterly consolidated leverage ratio calculation, on the unused portion of the credit facility. The Company has incurred total loan origination fees and other debt related costs associated with this revolving credit facility in the aggregate of approximately million. These costs are being amortized to interest expense over the remaining term of the loan, and the remaining unamortized balance of thousand as of September 30, 2024, is classified as part of non-current Other assets. As of September 30, 2024, RPC had outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility, and letters of credit outstanding relating to self-insurance programs and contract bids totaled million; therefore, a total of million of the facility was available.

During the first quarter of 2024, the Company sold all of its investment in equity securities. The net gain from sales of the equity securities was insignificant. Trading securities are comprised of the SERP assets, as described in the note titled Retirement Plans, and are recorded primarily at their net cash surrender values, calculated using their net asset values, which approximates fair value, as provided by the issuing insurance or investment company. Significant observable inputs, in addition to quoted market prices, were used to value the equity securities. The Company s policy is to recognize transfers between levels at the beginning of quarterly reporting periods. For the quarter ended September 30, 2024, there were no significant transfers in or out of levels 1, 2 or 3. Under the Company s revolving credit facility, there was balance outstanding at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Borrowings under our revolving credit facility are typically based on the quote from the lender (level 2 inputs), which approximates fair value, and bear variable interest rates as described in the note titled Notes Payable to Banks. The Company is subject to interest rate risk, to the extent there are outstanding borrowings on the variable component of the interest rate. The carrying amounts of other financial instruments reported in the balance sheet for current assets and current liabilities approximate their fair values because of the short maturity of these instruments. The Company currently does not use the fair value option to measure any of its existing financial instruments and has not determined whether it will elect this option for financial instruments acquired in the future.

 ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Overview The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this document. See also Forward-Looking Statements on page 26. RPC, Inc. (RPC or the Company) provides a broad range of specialized oilfield services primarily to independent and major oilfield companies engaged in exploration, production and development of oil and gas properties throughout the United States, including the Gulf of Mexico, mid-continent, southwest, Rocky Mountain and Appalachian regions, and in selected international locations. The Company s revenues and profits are generated by providing equipment and services to customers who operate oil and gas properties and invest capital to drill new wells and enhance production or perform maintenance on existing wells. We continuously monitor factors that impact current and expected customer activity levels, such as the prices of oil and natural gas, changes in pricing for our services and equipment, and utilization of our equipment and personnel. Our financial results are affected by geopolitical factors such as political instability in the petroleum-producing regions of the world, the actions of the OPEC oil cartel, overall economic conditions and weather in the United States, the prices of oil and natural gas, other shifting trends in our industry, and our customers drilling and production activities. The discussion of our key business and financial strategies set forth under the Overview section in the Company s annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, is incorporated herein by reference. During the third quarter of 2024, total revenues of 337.7 million increased by 7.2 million or 2.2 compared to the same period in the prior year. Income before income taxes was 23.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 24.9 million during the same period of 2023. Diluted earnings per share were 0.09 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 0.08 per share in the same period of 2023. Net cash provided by operating activities decreased to 255.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 299.1 million in the same period of 2023 primarily due to a decrease in net income during the first nine months of 2024 compared to the same period in the prior year, partially offset by favorable changes in working capital due primarily to a 52.8 million federal tax refund received during the second quarter of 2024.

 Outlook The current and projected prices of oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids are important catalysts for U.S. domestic drilling activity and can be impacted by economic developments as well as geopolitical disruptions, such as the continuing conflicts in the Middle East as well as Russia and Ukraine. RPC believes that oil prices remain at or above levels sufficient to motivate our customers to continue drilling and completion activities. The majority of the U.S. domestic rig count remains directed towards oil. During the third quarter of 2024, approximately 82 of the U.S. domestic rig count was directed towards oil, slightly above the prior year. We believe that oil-directed drilling will remain the majority of domestic drilling, and that natural gas-directed drilling will remain a low percentage of U.S. domestic drilling in the near term. However, we believe that natural gas-directed drilling will increase over time because of favorable long-term market dynamics. This projected higher demand for natural gas should drive increased activity in several of the basins in which RPC operates. We continue to monitor the market for our services and the competitive environment, including the current trends and expectations with regard to environmental concerns and related impact on our equipment fleets. The growing efficiency in recent years with which oilfield completion crews are providing services is a catalyst for the oversupplied nature of the oilfield services market. We have selectively upgraded our existing equipment to operate using multiple fuel sources and to take advantage of advances in technology and data collection. RPC continues to maintain and upgrade our current fleet capacity of revenue-producing equipment. We intend to remain highly disciplined about investing in new incremental revenue-producing equipment capacity and will only make such investments if we believe the projected financial returns of such capital expenditures meet our financial return criteria. Furthermore, the Company does not intend to add incremental pressure pumping capacity to the industry given the oversupplied nature of oilfield services mentioned above. The Company is allocating capital to maintain the capacity of our pressure pumping fleet to offset anticipated future fleet retirements and is evaluating future investments and options to further transition our asset base toward dual-fuel or electric equipment. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, capital expenditures totaled 179.5 million, primarily for capitalized maintenance and upgrades of our existing equipment, coupled with a new Tier 4 dual-fuel fleet that was placed into service during the second quarter of 2024. We currently expect capital expenditures to be between 200 million and 250 million during 2024 and to be directed primarily towards capitalized maintenance of our existing equipment and selected growth opportunities.

 THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2024 COMPARED TO THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2023 Revenues. Revenues of 337.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, increased 2.2 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in revenues is primarily due to higher pressure pumping activity levels compared to a particularly soft year-ago quarter. Pressure pumping remains highly competitive. Management believes the industry continues to be over-supplied, with frac fleets from gassy basins moving into the Permian over the past year and efficiency gains that are consistently adding pump hour capacity to the industry. These challenges have recently resulted in activity, asset utilization, and pricing trending lower. International revenues represented 3.2 of total revenues in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 2.2 in the same period of the prior year. We believe that international revenues will continue to be less than ten percent of RPC s consolidated revenues in the foreseeable future. During the third quarter of 2024, the average price of oil was 6.8 lower and the average price of natural gas was 18.9 lower, both as compared to the same period in the prior year. The average domestic rig count (Source: Baker Hughes, Inc.) for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was 9.7 lower than the same period in 2023. The Technical Services segment revenues for the third quarter of 2024 increased by 3.4 compared to the same period of the prior year due primarily to an increase in Pressure Pumping revenues, partially offset by lower coiled tubing revenues. Technical Services reported operating income of 16.3 million during the third quarter of 2024 compared to operating income of 18.9 million in the third quarter of 2023. The decrease in Technical Services operating income was primarily due to lower pricing in pressure pumping and several other service lines, as well as lower activity levels in coiled tubing. Support Services segment revenues for the third quarter of 2024 decreased by 11.7 compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to lower activity levels within rental tools. Support Services reported operating income of 5.3 million for the third quarter of 2024 compared to operating income of 6.9 million for the third quarter of 2023. Third quarter 2024 Support Services operating profit decreased by 1.6 million compared to the third quarter of the prior year due to lower activity levels and lower revenues over costs that are relatively fixed during the short term. Cost of revenues. Cost of revenues increased 3.5 to 247.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 239.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Cost of revenues increased primarily due to an increase in expenses consistent with higher activity levels, such as materials and supplies expenses and maintenance and repairs expenses. These costs increased slightly more than the revenue increase given the fixed nature of some of these costs, including labor, and the timing of maintenance and repairs. In accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) Topic 11.B, cost of revenues presented on the Consolidated Statements of Operations excludes depreciation and amortization totaling 31.8 million for the third quarter of 2024 compared to 25.6 million for the third quarter of 2023. Selling, general and administrative expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased to 37.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 42.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to a decrease in incentive compensation expense. Depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization increased 23.4 to 35.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 28.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Depreciation and amortization increased due to capital expenditures in the past year. Gain on disposition of assets, net. Gain on disposition of assets, net was 1.8 million for both the three months ended September 30, 2024, and for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The gain on disposition of assets, net is generally comprised of gains and losses related to various property and equipment dispositions or sales to customers of lost or damaged rental equipment. Other income, net. Other income, net was 1.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 804 thousand for the same period in the prior year. Interest expense and interest income. Interest expense increased to 261 thousand for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 101 thousand for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Interest expense includes facility fees on the unused portion of the credit facility and the amortization of loan costs. Interest income increased to 3.5 million compared to 1.5 million in the prior year due to a higher average cash balance.

 Income tax provision. Income tax provision was 4.7 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 6.5 million for the same period in 2023. The effective tax rate was 19.9 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 26.3 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in the 2024 effective tax rate is primarily due to a favorable change in permanent adjustments and favorable discrete adjustments, mainly resulting from provision to tax return entries. NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2024, COMPARED TO NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2023 Revenues. Revenues of 1.1 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, decreased 11.7 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in revenues is primarily due to lower industry activity levels across service lines and competitive pricing. During the first nine months of 2024, the average price of oil was 1.8 higher but the average price of natural gas was 14.6 lower, both as compared to the same period in the prior year. The average domestic rig count (Source: Baker Hughes, Inc.) for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was 14.8 lower than the same period in 2023. The Technical Services segment revenues for the first nine months of 2024 decreased by 11.7 compared to the same period of the prior year due primarily to a decrease in Pressure Pumping revenues, as well as most other service lines, due to lower industry activity and more competitive pricing. Technical Services reported operating income of 78.5 million during the first nine months of 2024 compared to operating income of 199.5 million during the first nine months of 2023. The decrease in Technical Services operating income was primarily due to a decrease in pressure pumping activity, competitive pricing and reduced fixed cost absorption. Support Services segment revenues for the first nine months of 2024 decreased by 12.3 compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to lower activity levels within rental tools. Support Services reported operating income of 13.3 million for the first nine months of 2024 compared to operating income of 21.4 million for the first nine months of 2023. Support Services operating profit for the first nine months of 2024 decreased by 8.1 million compared to the first nine months of the prior year due to lower activity levels and lower revenues over costs that are relatively fixed during the short term. Cost of revenues. Cost of revenues decreased 2.9 to 786.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 810.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Cost of revenues decreased primarily due to reduced expenses consistent with lower activity levels, such as materials and supplies expenses and maintenance and repairs expenses. These costs decreased less than the revenue decrease given the fixed nature of some of these costs, including labor, and the timing of maintenance and repairs. In accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) Topic 11.B, cost of revenues presented on the Consolidated Statements of Operations excludes depreciation and amortization totaling 88.7 million for the first nine months of 2024 compared to 71.2 million for the first nine months of 2023. Selling, general and administrative expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased to 115.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 127.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to a decrease in variable expenses consistent with lower activity levels as well as incentive compensation. Depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization increased 23.8 to 97.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 78.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Depreciation and amortization increased due to capital expenditures in the past year. Gain on disposition of assets, net. Gain on disposition of assets, net was 6.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to a gain on disposition of assets, net of 7.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The gain on disposition of assets, net is generally comprised of gains and losses related to various property and equipment dispositions or sales to customers of lost or damaged rental equipment. Other income, net. Other income, net was 2.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 2.2 million for the same period in the prior year. Interest expense and interest income. Interest expense increased to 594 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 246 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

 Income tax provision. Income tax provision was 20.1 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 48.8 million for the same period in 2023. The effective provision rate was 20.3 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 24.0 effective provision rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in the 2024 effective tax rate is primarily due to a favorable change in permanent adjustments and favorable discrete adjustments, mainly resulting from provision to tax return entries, expiration of statute limitations, and interest on refunds received. Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash Flows The Company s cash and cash equivalents increased 53.6 million to 276.9 million as of September 30, 2024, compared to cash and cash equivalents of 223.3 million as of December 31, 2023. The following table sets forth the historical cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: 

Nine months ended September 30, (In thousands) 2024 2023 Net cash provided by operating activities 255,215 299,142 Net cash used for investing activities (165,333) (215,045) Net cash used for financing activities (36,304) (38,647) Cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, decreased by 43.9 million compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to a decrease in net income, partially offset by favorable changes in working capital. Change in working capital was a source of cash of 77.1 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 40.9 million in the same period last year. Changes in working capital during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, is comprised of the following: a decrease of 51.3 million in taxes receivable primarily due to a 52.8 million federal tax refund received during the second quarter of 2024, coupled with a 49.4 million decrease in accounts receivable, partially offset by an unfavorable change of 15.7 million in unearned revenue. The decrease in unearned revenue was due to the satisfaction of performance obligations that were associated with a customer cash prepayment we received in 2023. The changes in the other components were mainly due to the timing of payments and receipts. Cash used for investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, decreased by 49.7 million compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to the purchase of Spinnaker during 2023, partially offset by an increase in capital expenditures primarily due to the timing of new equipment deliveries. Capital expenditures were 179.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 148.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Cash used for financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, decreased by 2.3 million compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to a decrease in repurchases of the Company s common shares in the open market. Financial Condition and Liquidity The Company s financial condition as of September 30, 2024, remains strong. We believe the liquidity provided by our existing cash and cash equivalents and our overall strong capitalization will provide sufficient liquidity to meet our requirements for at least the next twelve months. The Company s decisions relating to the amount of cash to be used for investing and financing activities are influenced by our capital position, and the expected amount of cash to be provided by operations. RPC does not currently expect to utilize our revolving credit facility to meet these liquidity requirements. The majority of our cash and cash equivalents are held at a single financial institution and are in excess of amounts insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). This financial institution is among the largest in the United States and we believe it is a safe place to hold our deposits. The Company currently has a 100.0 million revolving credit facility that matures in June 2027. The facility contains customary terms and conditions, including restrictions on indebtedness, dividend payments, business combinations and other related items. In the third quarter of 2023, the Company amended the revolving credit facility. Among other matters, the amendment (1) extends the 

 24 

Table of Contents RPC, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
 termination date for revolving loans from July 26, 2024 to June 22, 2027, (2) replaces LIBOR with Term SOFR as an interest rate option in connection with revolving loan borrowings and reduces the applicable rate margins by approximately 0.25 at each pricing level, (3) introduces a 1.00 per annum floor for base rate borrowings, and (4) permits the issuance of letters of credit in currencies other than U.S. dollars. As of September 30, 2024, RPC had no outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility, and letters of credit outstanding relating to self-insurance programs and contract bids totaled 16.5 million; therefore, a total of 83.5 million of the facility was available. The Company was in compliance with the credit facility financial covenants as of September 30, 2024. For additional information with respect to RPC s facility, see the note titled Notes Payable to Banks of the Consolidated Financial Statements. Cash Requirements The Company currently expects capital expenditures to be between 200 million and 250 million in 2024 and to be directed towards both capitalized maintenance of our existing equipment and selected growth opportunities. The Company is allocating capital to maintain the capacity of our pressure pumping fleet to offset anticipated future fleet retirements and is evaluating future investments and options to further transition our asset base toward dual-fuel or electric equipment. During the second quarter of 2024, the Company replaced a Tier 2 diesel fleet with a new Tier 4 dual-fuel fleet. The actual amount of capital expenditures in 2024 will depend primarily on equipment maintenance requirements and equipment delivery schedules. The Company has ongoing sales and use tax audits in various jurisdictions subject to varying interpretations of statutes. The Company has recorded the exposure from these audits to the extent issues are resolved or are probable and reasonably estimable. These audits involve issues that could result in unfavorable outcomes that cannot be currently estimated. See note of the Consolidated Financial Statements titled Commitments and Contingencies for additional information. The Company has a stock buyback program to repurchase up to 49,578,125 shares in the open market, including an additional 8,000,000 shares authorized for repurchase by the Board of Directors in the second quarter of 2023. As of September 30, 2024, 12,768,870 shares remained available to be repurchased. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, there were no shares repurchased by the Company in the open market. During the three months ended September 30, 2023, the Company repurchased 136,692 shares in the open market. The Company may repurchase outstanding common shares periodically based on market conditions and our capital allocation strategies considering restrictions under our credit facility. The stock buyback program does not have a predetermined expiration date. For additional information with respect to RPC s stock buyback program, see note of the Consolidated Financial Statements titled Cash Paid for Common Stock Purchased and Retired. On October 22, 2024, the Board of Directors approved the termination of the Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan SERP ). Pursuant to the Internal Revenue Service rules, participant balances will be distributed 12 months after the termination of the SERP. The Company expects to distribute participant balances in the fourth quarter of 2025 and is currently evaluating its funding options. Also, on October 22, 2024, the Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of 0.04 per share payable December 10, 2024, to common stockholders of record at the close of business on November 11, 2024. The Company expects to continue to pay cash dividends to common stockholders, subject to industry conditions and RPC s earnings, financial condition, and other relevant factors. INFLATION The Company purchases its equipment and materials from suppliers who provide competitive prices and employ skilled workers from competitive labor markets. If inflation in the general economy increases, the Company s costs for equipment, materials and labor could increase as well. In addition, increases in activity in the domestic oilfield can cause upward wage pressures in the labor markets from which it hires employees, especially if employment in the general economy increases. Also, activity increases can cause supply disruptions and higher costs of certain materials and key equipment components used to provide services to the Company s customers. In recent years, the price of labor and raw materials increased while labor shortages caused by the departure of skilled labor from the domestic oilfield industry in prior years. These cost increases have moderated but remain high by historical standards. OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS The Company does not have any material off balance sheet arrangements.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES The discussion of Critical Accounting Policies is incorporated herein by reference from the Company s annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. There have been no significant changes in the critical accounting policies since year-end. IMPACT OF RECENT ACCOUNTING STANDARDS See note to the Consolidated Financial Statements titled Recent Accounting Standards for a description of recent accounting standards, including the expected dates of adoption and estimated effects on results of operations and financial condition. SEASONALITY Oil and natural gas prices affect demand throughout the oil and natural gas industry, including the demand for the Company s products and services. The Company s business depends in large part on the economic conditions of the oil and gas industry, and specifically on the capital expenditures of its customers related to the exploration and production of oil and natural gas. There is a positive correlation between these expenditures and customers demand for the Company s services. As such, when these expenditures fluctuate, customers demand for the Company s services fluctuates as well. These fluctuations depend on the current and projected prices of oil and natural gas and resulting drilling activity and are not seasonal to any material degree.

 ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The Company is subject to interest rate risk exposure through borrowings on its credit facility. As of September 30, 2024, there were no outstanding interest-bearing advances on our credit facility, which bear interest at a floating rate. Additionally, the Company is exposed to market risk resulting from changes in foreign exchange rates. However, since the majority of the Company s transactions occur in U.S. currency, this risk is not expected to have a material effect on its consolidated results of operations or financial condition. ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in its Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Commission s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to its management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. As of the end of the period covered by this report, September 30, 2024 (the Evaluation Date), the Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of its management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures. Based upon this evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective at a reasonable assurance level as of the Evaluation Date. Changes in internal control over financial reporting Effective July 1, 2023, the Company completed its acquisition of all of the outstanding equity interests in Spinnaker Oilfield Services LLC (Spinnaker). Management had elected to exclude Spinnaker s internal controls from its assessment of the Company s internal control over financial reporting contained in its 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, based on the guidelines established by the Securities and Exchange Commission. As of July 1, 2024, Spinnaker has been fully integrated into our reporting systems and all of our disclosure controls and procedures have incorporated Spinnaker effectively. There were no other changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting during the third quarter of 2024 which were identified in connection with management s evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
