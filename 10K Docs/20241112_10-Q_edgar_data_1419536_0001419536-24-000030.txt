 Lines of credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition of the contract. Lines of credit generally have variable interest rates. Such lines do not represent future cash requirements because it is unlikely that all customers will, at any given time, draw upon their lines in full. Loan commitments generally have variable interest rates, fixed expiration dates, and may require payment of a fee. 
 The Company's maximum exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the customer is the contractual amount of the credit commitment. Loan commitments and lines of credit are generally made on the same terms, including with regard to collateral, as outstanding loans. Management is not aware of any accounting loss to be incurred by funding these loan commitments. 
 The Company maintains an estimated reserve for unfunded commitments and certain off-balance sheet items such as unfunded lines of credit, which is reflected in other liabilities, with increases or decreases in the reserve being charged to or released from operating expense.

 Fair value of financial instruments 
 Fair value information about financial instruments, whether or not recognized in the balance sheet, for which it is practical to estimate the value is based upon the characteristics of the instruments and relevant market information. Financial instruments include cash, evidence of ownership in an entity, or contracts that convey or impose on an entity the contractual right or obligation to either receive or deliver cash for another financial instrument. 
 The information used to determine fair value is highly subjective in nature and, therefore, the results are imprecise. Subjective factors include, among other things, estimates of cash flows, risk characteristics, credit quality, and interest rates, all of which are subject to change. Since the fair value is estimated as of the balance sheet date, the amounts that will actually be realized or paid upon settlement or maturity on these various instruments could be significantly different.

 Critical Accounting Policies 
 34 

The accounting and reporting policies of the Company are in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America GAAP and conform to general practices within the banking industry. The Company s financial position and results of operations are affected by management s application of accounting policies, including estimates, assumptions and judgments made to arrive at the carrying value of assets and liabilities and amounts reported for revenues, expenses and related disclosures. Different assumptions in the application of these policies could result in material changes in the Company s consolidated financial position and/or results of operations. The Company evaluates its critical accounting estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis and updates them, as deemed necessary. Management has discussed the Company s critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company. 
 The Company s accounting policies are fundamental to understanding the Company s consolidated financial position and consolidated results of operations. Accordingly, the Company s significant accounting policies are discussed in detail in Note 1 Nature of Business and Basis of Presentation in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 Overview 
 We are Capital Bancorp, Inc., a bank holding company and a Maryland corporation incorporated in 1998, operating primarily through our wholly-owned subsidiary, Capital Bank, N.A., a commercial-focused community bank based in the Washington D.C. and Baltimore metropolitan areas. The Bank is headquartered in Rockville, Maryland, received its charter in 1999 and began operations the same year. We serve businesses, not-for-profit associations, entrepreneurs and others throughout the Washington, D.C. and Baltimore, Maryland metropolitan areas and Fort Lauderdale, Florida through five commercial bank branches, one mortgage office, and two loan production offices. 
 The Company currently operates three divisions: Commercial Banking, Capital Bank Home Loans, and OpenSky . The Company reports its activities in four business segments: commercial banking; mortgage lending; credit cards; and corporate activities. In determining the appropriateness of segment definition, the Company considers components of the business about which financial information is available and regularly evaluated relative to resource allocation and performance assessment. The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP, and conform to general practices within the banking industry. 
 Our Commercial Banking division accounts for the majority of the Bank s total assets. Our commercial bankers endeavor to provide quality service, customized solutions and tailored advice to commercial clients in our operating markets, primarily in the Washington, D.C. and Baltimore metropolitan areas. 
 Our Capital Bank Home Loans CBHL division originates conventional and government-guaranteed residential mortgage loans on a nationwide basis primarily for sale into the secondary market and, in certain circumstances, for the Bank s loan portfolio. 
 Our OpenSky division provides secured, partially secured and unsecured credit cards on a nationwide basis to under-banked populations and those looking to rebuild their credit scores. OpenSky cards operate on a digital and mobile enabled platform with almost all marketing and application procedures being conducted through website and mobile applications. For the secured credit card, a deposit equal to the full credit limit of the card is made, upon account opening, into a noninterest-bearing demand account with the Bank and the deposit is required to be maintained throughout the life of the card. Using our proprietary scoring model, which considers credit score and repayment history (typically a minimum of six months of on-time repayments, but ultimately determined on a case-by-case basis), OpenSky also offers certain existing customers an unsecured line supplementary to their secured line of credit.

Capital 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Bank was in compliance with all applicable regulatory capital requirements to which it was subject, and the Bank was classified as well capitalized for purposes of the prompt corrective action regulations. There are no conditions or events since that notification that management believes would change the Bank s classification. We closely monitor our capital position and intend to take appropriate steps to ensure that our level of capital remains strong. 
 Acquisition of Integrated Financial Holdings, Inc. 
 On October 1, 2024, the Company completed its previously announced merger (the Merger with IFHI pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization (the Merger Agreement ), dated as of March 27, 2024. At the effective time of the Merger (the Effective Time ), IFHI merged with and into the Company, with the Company continuing as the surviving corporation in the Merger. Immediately following the Merger, West Town Bank Trust, merged with and into Capital Bank, with Capital Bank as the surviving bank. 
 In accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement, each share of IFHI s common stock, par value 1.00 per share was converted into the right to receive (i) 1.115 shares of the Company s common stock, par value 0.01 per share, and (ii) subject to certain adjustments, 5.36 in cash per share of IFHI common stock, par value 1.00 per share, held immediately prior to the Effective Time, as well as cash in lieu of fractional shares of the Company s common stock. In addition, each stock option granted by IFHI to purchase shares of IFHI common stock, whether vested or unvested, outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, was assumed by the Company and converted into an equivalent option to purchase the Company s common stock, with the same terms and conditions as applied to the IFHI stock option.

 Results of Operations 
 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 This document contains non-GAAP financial measures denoted throughout our MD A by reference to non-GAAP. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors because they are used by management to evaluate our operating performance and make day-to-day operating decisions. In addition, we believe our non-GAAP results in any given reporting period reflect our on-going financial performance in that period and, accordingly, are useful to consider in addition to our GAAP financial results. We further believe the presentation of non-GAAP results increases comparability of period-to-period results. 
 Other companies may use similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures that may be calculated differently from the way we calculate such measures. Accordingly, our non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similar measures used by such companies. We caution investors not to place undue reliance on such non-GAAP financial measures, but to consider them with the most directly comparable GAAP measures. Non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for our results reported under GAAP. 
 For more information on the computation of non-GAAP financial measures, see Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Reconciliations.

 Net Interest Income and Net Margin Analysis 
 Net interest income is the difference between interest income on earning assets and the cost of funds supporting those assets. Interest earning assets are composed primarily of loans, loans held for sale, investment securities, and interest-bearing deposits with banks. The cost of funds represents interest expense on deposits and borrowings, which consist of federal funds purchased, advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank FHLB and subordinated notes. Noninterest-bearing deposits and capital also provide sources of funding. 
 38 

We analyze our ability to maximize income generated from interest earning assets and control the interest expenses associated with our liabilities, measured as net interest income, through our net interest margin and net interest spread. Net interest margin is a ratio calculated as net interest income annualized divided by average interest earning assets for the same period. Net interest spread is the difference between average interest rates earned on interest earning assets and average interest rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities. 
 Changes in market interest rates and the interest rates we earn on interest earning assets or pay on interest-bearing liabilities, as well as in the volume and mix of interest earning assets, interest-bearing and noninterest-bearing liabilities and stockholders equity, are usually the largest drivers of periodic changes in net interest income, net interest margin and net interest spread. Fluctuations in market interest rates are driven by many factors, including governmental monetary policies, inflation, deflation, macroeconomic developments, changes in unemployment, the money supply, political and international conditions and conditions in domestic and foreign financial markets. Periodic changes in the volume and types of loans in our loan portfolio are affected by, among other factors, economic and competitive conditions in the Washington, D.C. and Baltimore metropolitan areas, as well as developments affecting the real estate, technology, government services, hospitality and tourism and financial services sectors within our target markets and throughout the Washington, D.C. and Baltimore metropolitan areas. Our ability to respond to changes in these factors by using effective asset-liability management techniques is critical to maintaining the stability of net interest income and net interest margin. 
 The table below presents the average balances and weighted average rates of the major categories of the Company s assets, liabilities, and stockholders equity for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Weighted average yields are derived by dividing annualized income by the average balance of the related assets, and weighted average rates are derived by dividing annualized expense by the average balance of the related liabilities, for the periods shown. Average outstanding balances are derived by utilizing average daily balances for the time period shown. The weighted average yields and rates include amortization of fees, costs, premiums and discounts, which are considered adjustments to yield/rates. Weighted average yields on tax-exempt securities are not calculated on a fully taxable equivalent basis.

 Total interest income was impacted by the effect of growth in average portfolio loan balances and increases in market interest rates when comparing the three months ended September 30, 2024 to the same period in 2023. The loan portfolio, excluding credit cards, continued to experience growth through the three months ended September 30, 2024, which contributed an additional 5.3 million in interest income. Total interest expense was impacted by growth in average balances of time deposits and money market accounts contributing 1.3 million and 0.5 million, respectively, in interest expense and increased rates on time deposits and money market accounts, which contributed an additional 0.5 million and 0.6 million, respectively, of interest expense. 
 When comparing the nine months ended September 30, 2024 to the same period in 2023, the greatest positive impact to total interest income was the effect of growth in average portfolio loan balances and increases in market interest rates. The loan portfolio, excluding credit cards, contributed 10.1 million in interest income from volume and 6.1 million in interest income from an increase in market interest rates for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in the 
 42 

prior year. Total interest expense was impacted by growth in average balances of time deposits and money market accounts contributing 4.2 million and 1.7 million, respectively, in interest expense and increased rates on time deposits and money market accounts, which contributed an additional 2.1 million and 3.5 million, respectively, of interest expense. 
 Provision for Credit Losses 
 The provision for credit losses represents the amount of expense charged to current earnings to fund the ACL. The amount for credit losses is based on many factors which reflect management s assessment of the risk in the loan portfolio. Those factors include historical losses, forecasted cash flows, economic conditions and trends, the value and adequacy of collateral, volume and mix of the portfolio, performance of the portfolio, and internal loan processes of the Company and Bank. For a description of the factors taken into account by our management in determining the ACL, see Note 1 Nature of Business and Basis of Presentation in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the provision for credit losses was 3.7 million, an increase of 1.5 million from the same period in 2023, attributable primarily to portfolio loan growth. Net charge-offs for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were 2.7 million, or 0.51 on an annualized basis of average portfolio loans, compared to 1.8 million, or 0.38 on an annualized basis of average portfolio loans for the same period in 2023. Of the 2.7 million in net charge-offs during the quarter, 1.0 million related to secured and partially secured credit cards and 0.7 million related to unsecured credit cards. Further, 0.6 million of net charge-offs were related to commercial real estate loans and 0.4 million were related to commercial and industrial loans. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the provision for credit losses was 9.9 million, an increase of 3.1 million from the same period in 2023, attributable primarily to portfolio loan growth and specific reserves of 1.0 million for collateral dependent loans at September 30, 2024, as compared to 0.7 million at September 30, 2023. Net charge-offs for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 6.6 million, or 0.44 on an annualized basis of average portfolio loans, compared to 6.0 million, or 0.45 on an annualized basis of average portfolio loans, for the same period in 2023. The 6.6 million in net charge-offs during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was comprised primarily of credit card portfolio net charge-offs, with 3.1 million related to secured and partially secured cards while 1.8 million was related to unsecured cards. Further, 0.6 million of net charge-offs were related to commercial real estate loans, 0.6 million were related to multi-family loans and 0.5 million were related to commercial and industrial loans. 
 Although the majority of OpenSky credit cards are secured, losses may occur. Some losses result from identity fraud, payment fraud and funding fraud. In addition, losses are sometimes incurred when customers exceed established credit limits as a consequence of certain VISA membership policies that allow cardholders to incur certain charges, such as, for example, rental car charges, gas station charges and hotel deposits, that may exceed card limits. Finally, losses to our credit card portfolio may arise if cardholders cease to maintain the account in good standing with timely payments. 
 The ACL as a percent of portfolio loans was 1.51 at September 30, 2024 as compared to 1.50 at December 31, 2023. The maintenance of a high-quality loan portfolio, with an adequate allowance for expected credit losses, will continue to be a primary objective for the Company. See additional discussion regarding the Company s ACL and reserve for unfunded commitments credit exposures at September 30, 2024 in Financial Condition - Allowance for Credit Losses.

Noninterest Income 
 Our primary sources of recurring noninterest income are credit card fees, such as interchange fees and statement fees, and mortgage banking revenue. Noninterest income does not include (i) loan origination fees to the extent they exceed the direct loan origination costs, which are generally recognized over the life of the related loan as an adjustment to yield using the interest method or (ii) annual, renewal and late fees related to our credit card portfolio, which are generally recognized over the twelve month life of the related loan as an adjustment to yield using the interest method. 
 The following table presents, for the periods indicated, the major categories of noninterest income: 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change 2024 2023 Change (in thousands) Noninterest income: Service charges on deposit accounts 235 250 (6.0) 642 724 (11.3) Credit card fees 4,055 4,387 (7.6) 12,266 13,303 (7.8) Mortgage banking revenue 1,882 1,243 51.4 5,325 3,730 42.8 Other income 463 446 3.8 1,264 1,282 (1.4) Total noninterest income 6,635 6,326 4.9 19,497 19,039 2.4 
 Mortgage banking revenue of 1.9 million increased 0.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 due to an increase in salable originations as compared to the prior year. Mortgage banking revenue of 5.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 1.6 million due to an increase in home loan sales as compared to the prior year. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, credit card fees of 4.1 million declined by 0.3 million as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily related to lower interchange and other fee income. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, credit card fees of 12.3 million declined 1.0 million as a result of lower interchange and other fee income recognized compared to the prior year. 
 The Bank s CBHL division experienced an increase of 49.3 in mortgage originations during the three months ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the same period in the prior year. Origination volumes increased 24.7 million, to 74.7 million, in the third quarter of 2024, when compared to 50.0 million in the third quarter of 2023. Gain on sale margins decreased from 2.57 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, to 2.44 for the three months ended September 30, 2024. Gain on sale margins decreased from 2.71 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, to 2.65 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Mortgage loans sold are subject to repurchase in circumstances where documentation is deficient or the underlying loan becomes delinquent or pays off within a specified period following loan funding and sale. The Bank has established a reserve under GAAP for possible repurchases. The reserve was 0.9 million and 1.0 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The Bank repurchased one loan totaling 0.3 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The Bank did not repurchase any loans during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The Bank does not originate sub-prime mortgage loans and has no exposure to this market segment. 
 Noninterest Expense 
 Generally, noninterest expense is comprised of all employee expenses and costs associated with operating our facilities, obtaining and retaining customer relationships and providing bank services, with the largest component being salaries and employee benefits expenses. Noninterest expense also includes operational expenses, such as occupancy and equipment expenses, professional fees, 
 44 

advertising expenses, loan processing expenses and other general and administrative expenses, including FDIC assessments, communications, travel, meals, training, supplies and postage. 
 The following table presents, for the periods indicated, the major categories of noninterest expense:

 Noninterest expense was 29.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 28.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 1.7 million. The change includes increases in salaries and employee benefits expenses of 0.9 million, data processing expense of 0.5 million, merger-related expenses of 0.5 million, occupancy and equipment expenses of 0.4 million, loan processing expenses of 0.2 million and operational losses of 0.1 million.

 Noninterest expense was 88.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 83.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 4.8 million, or 5.8 . The change includes increases in salaries and employee benefits expenses which increased by 2.4 million, or 6.5 , merger-related expenses of 1.3 million, occupancy and equipment expenses of 1.2 million, advertising expenses of 0.6 million and other operating expenses of 0.5 million partially offset by a decrease in professional fees of 1.6 million. 
 Income Tax Expense 
 The amount of income tax expense we incur is influenced by our pre-tax income and our nondeductible expenses. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are reflected at enacted tax rates in effect for the period in which the deferred tax assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled. A valuation allowance is established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized. 
 Income tax expense was 2.8 million and 7.6 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to 3.0 million and 8.2 million for the same periods, respectively, in 2023. Our effective tax rates increased from 23.4 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 24.6 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and from 23.3 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 24.5 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, reflective of an increase in the weighted average state income tax rate.

 Investment Securities 
 The Company uses its securities portfolio to provide a source of liquidity, provide an appropriate return on funds invested, manage interest rate risk, meet collateral requirements and meet regulatory capital requirements. 
 Management classifies investment securities as either held to maturity or available-for-sale based on our intentions and the Company s ability to hold such securities until maturity. In determining such classifications, securities that management has the positive intent and the Company has the ability to hold until maturity are classified as held to maturity and carried at amortized cost. All other securities are designated as available-for-sale and carried at estimated fair value with unrealized gains and losses included in stockholders equity on an after-tax basis. As of September 30, 2024, all securities were classified as available-for-sale. 
 To supplement interest income earned on our loan portfolio, the Company invests in U.S. Treasuries, high-quality mortgage-backed securities, government agency bonds, asset-backed securities and high-quality municipal and corporate bonds. The asset-backed securities are comprised of student loan collateral issued by the Federal Family Education Loan Program, which includes a minimum of a 97 
 46 

government repayment guarantee, as well as additional support in excess of the government guaranteed portion. 
 The following tables summarize the contractual maturities, without consideration of call features or pre-refunding dates, and weighted-average yields of investment securities at September 30, 2024 and the amortized cost and carrying value of those securities as of the indicated dates. The weighted average yields were calculated by multiplying the amortized cost of each individual security by its yield, dividing that figure by the portfolio total, and then summing the value of these results to arrive at the weighted average yield. Yields on tax-exempt investments are not calculated on a fully tax equivalent basis.

 As described in Note 4 - Investment Securities in the Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements, at September 30, 2024, management determined the Company does not have the intent to sell, nor is it more likely than not that it will be required to sell, available-for-sale debt securities in an unrealized loss position at September 30, 2024 before it is able to recover the amortized cost basis. Further, management reviewed the Company s holdings as of September 30, 2024 and concluded there were no credit-related declines in fair value. Additional information related to the types of securities held at September 30, 2024, other than securities issued or guaranteed by U.S. Government entities or agencies, is as follows: 
 Corporate Securities There have been no payment defaults on any of the Company s holdings of corporate debt securities. There are five securities all of which are subordinated debt of other financial institutions with face amounts ranging from 0.5 million to 2 million. 
 Municipal Securities All of the Company s holdings of municipal bonds were investment grade and there have been no payment defaults. Summary ratings information at September 30, 2024, based on the amortized cost basis and reflecting the lowest enhanced or underlying rating by Moody s, Standard Poors or Fitch, is as follows: AAA 82 of the portfolio; AA+ 8 ; AA 10 . 
 Asset-backed Securities There were three investment grade asset-backed securities, and there have been no payment defaults on these securities. 
 As such, it is deemed the above listed securities are not in an unrealized loss position due to credit-related issues and no further analysis is warranted as of September 30, 2024.

Portfolio Loans Receivable 
 Our primary source of income is derived from interest earned on loans. Our portfolio loans consist of loans secured by real estate as well as commercial business loans, credit card loans secured by corresponding deposits at the Bank and, to a limited extent, other consumer loans. Our loan customers primarily consist of small- to medium-sized businesses, professionals, real estate investors, small residential builders and individuals. Our owner-occupied commercial real estate loans, residential construction loans and commercial business and investment loans provide us with higher risk-adjusted returns, shorter maturities and more sensitivity to interest rate fluctuations, and are complemented by our relatively lower risk residential real estate loans to individuals. Our credit card portfolio supplements our traditional lending products with enhanced yields. Our lending activities, outside of credit cards, are principally directed to our market area consisting of the Washington, D.C. and Baltimore, Maryland metropolitan areas. 
 Residential Real Estate Loans . One-to-four family mortgage loans are primarily secured by owner-occupied primary and secondary residences and, to a lesser extent, investor-owned residences. Residential loans are originated through the commercial sales teams and CBHL division. Residential loans also include home equity lines of credit. Owner-occupied residential real estate loans usually have fixed rates for five or seven years and adjust on an annual basis after the initial term based on a typical maturity of 30 years. Investor residential real estate loans are generally based on 25-year terms with a balloon payment due after five years. Generally, the required minimum debt service coverage ratio is 115 . 
 Commercial Real Estate Loans . Commercial real estate loans are originated on owner-occupied and non-owner-occupied properties. These loans may be adversely affected by conditions in the real estate markets or in the general economy. Business equity lines of credit totaling 2.7 million as of September 30, 2024 and 14.1 million as of December 31, 2023, are included in the commercial real estate loan category. Business equity lines of credit are commercial purpose lines of credit primarily secured by the business owners residential properties. Lender finance loans totaling 29.5 million as of September 30, 2024 and 11.1 million as of December 31, 2023, are also included in the commercial real estate loan category. Lender finance loans are loans to companies used to purchase finance receivables or extend finance receivables to the underlying obligors and are secured primarily by the finance receivables held by our borrowers. The primary sources of repayment are the operating incomes of the borrowers and the collection of the finance receivables securing the loans. Commercial loans that are secured by owner-occupied commercial real estate and primarily collateralized by operating cash flows are included in the commercial real estate loan category. As of September 30, 2024, there were approximately 351.5 million of owner-occupied commercial real estate loans, representing approximately 16.6 of the loan portfolio as compared to 307.9 million, or 16.1 of the loan portfolio at December 31, 2023. Commercial real estate loan terms are generally extended for 10 years or less and amortize generally over 25 years or less. The interest rates on commercial real estate loans generally have initial fixed rate terms that adjust typically at five years. Origination fees are routinely charged for services. Personal guarantees from the principal owners of the business are generally required, supported by a review of the principal owners personal financial statements and global debt service obligations. The properties securing the portfolio are diverse in type. This diversity may help reduce the exposure to adverse economic events that affect any single industry. 
 Construction Loans . Construction loans are offered within the Company s Washington, D.C. and Baltimore, Maryland metropolitan operating areas to builders, primarily for the construction of single-family homes and condominium and townhouse conversions or renovations and, to a lesser extent, to individuals. Construction loans typically have terms of 12 to 18 months. The Company frequently transitions the end purchaser to permanent financing or re-underwriting and sale into the secondary market through its CBHL division. According to underwriting standards, the ratio of loan principal to collateral value, as established by an independent appraisal, cannot exceed 75 for investor-owned and 80 for owner-occupied properties, although exceptions are sometimes made. The Company performs a 
 48 

stress test of the construction loan portfolio at least once a year, and underlying real estate conditions are monitored as well as trends in sales outcomes versus underwriting valuations as part of ongoing risk management efforts. The borrowers progress in construction buildout is monitored against the original underwriting guidelines for construction milestones and completion timelines. 
 Commercial and Industrial . In addition to other loan products, general commercial loans, including commercial lines of credit, working capital loans, term loans, equipment financing, letters of credit and other loan products, are offered, primarily in target markets, and underwritten based on each borrower s ability to service debt from income. These loans are primarily made based on the identified cash flows of the borrower and secondarily, on the underlying collateral provided by the borrower. Most commercial business loans are secured by a lien on general business assets including, among other things, available real estate, accounts receivable, promissory notes, inventory and equipment. Personal guaranties from the borrower or other principal are generally obtained. 
 Credit Cards . Through the OpenSky credit card division, the Company offers secured, partially secured, and unsecured credit cards on a nationwide basis to under-banked populations and those looking to rebuild their credit scores through a fully digital and mobile platform. The secured lines of credit are secured by a noninterest-bearing demand account at the Bank in an amount equal to the full credit limit of the credit card. For the partially secured lines of credit, the Bank offers certain customers an unsecured line in excess of their secured line of credit by using a proprietary scoring model, which considers credit score and repayment history (typically a minimum of six months of on-time payments, but ultimately determined on a case-by-case basis). Partially secured and unsecured credit cards are only extended to existing secured card customers who have demonstrated sound credit behaviors. Approximately 89.6 million and 95.3 million in secured and partially secured credit card balances were protected by savings deposits held by the Company as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Unsecured balances were 39.7 million and 30.8 million, respectively, at the same dates. 
 Other Consumer Loans . To a limited extent and typically as an accommodation to existing customers, personal consumer loans, such as term loans, car loans and boat loans are offered. 
 Purchased Credit Deterioration . There were no loans purchased with credit deterioration during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 or the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 The repayment of loans is a source of additional liquidity for the Company. The following table details contractual maturities of our portfolio loans, along with an analysis of loans maturing after one year categorized by rate characteristic. Loans with adjustable interest rates are shown as maturing in the period during which the contract is due. The table does not reflect the effects of possible prepayments.

 Multi-family loans totaled 170.5 million at September 30, 2024 and are included in the real estate residential loan category. At September 30, 2024, the Company had approximately 66.3 million in multi-family loans in the District of Columbia secured by properties with tenants, some of whom are beneficiaries of rent stabilization or rent control programs. Under the Rent Control Act in the District of Columbia, properties built prior to 1975 limit rent increases to no more than annually unless a unit becomes vacant, and increases are generally limited to the Consumer Price Index plus 2 not to exceed 10 . Further, there must be at least 30 days notice of rent increase. The Company does not have any multi-family loans in New York City or New York state.

 Nonperforming Assets 
 Loans are placed on nonaccrual status when, in management s opinion, the borrower may be unable to meet payment obligations as they become due, as well as when required by regulatory provisions. Loans may be placed on nonaccrual status regardless of whether or not such loans are considered past due. In general, we place loans on nonaccrual status when they become 90 days past due. We also place loans on nonaccrual status if they are less than 90 days past due if the collection of principal or interest is in doubt. When the interest accrual is discontinued, all unpaid accrued interest is reversed from income. Loans are returned to accrual status when all the principal and interest amounts contractually due are brought current and future payments are, in management s opinion, reasonably assured. 
 Loans are generally charged-off in part or in full when management determines the loan to be uncollectible. Factors for charge-off that may be considered include: repayments deemed to be extended out beyond reasonable time frames, customer bankruptcy and lack of assets, and/or collateral deficiencies. Consumer credit card balances are moved into the charge off queue after they become more than 90 days past due and are charged off not later than 120 days after they become past due. Otherwise, loans that are past due for 180 days or more are charged off unless the loan is well secured and in the process of collection. 
 The Company believes its approach to lending and the management of nonperforming assets has resulted in sound asset quality and timely resolution of problem assets. The Company has established underwriting guidelines to be followed by our bankers, and routinely monitors our delinquency levels for any negative or adverse trends. There can be no assurance, however, that our loan portfolio will not become subject to increasing pressures from deteriorating borrower credit. 
 From a credit risk standpoint, we grade watchlist and problem loans into one of five credit quality indicators: pass/watch, special mention, substandard, doubtful or loss. The classifications of loans reflect a judgment about the risks of default and loss associated with each loan. Credit ratings are reviewed regularly and adjusted regularly to reflect the degree of risk and loss that our management believes to be appropriate for each credit. Our lending policy requires the routine monitoring of past due reports, daily overdraft reports, monthly maturing loans, monthly risk rating reports and internal loan review reports. The lending and credit management of the Bank meet periodically to review loans rated pass/watch. The focus of each meeting is to identify and promptly determine any necessary required action within this loan population, which consists of loans that, although considered satisfactory and performing to terms, may exhibit special risk features that warrant management s attention. 
 52 

Management is intent on maintaining a strong credit review function and risk rating process. The Company has an experienced Credit Administration function, which provides independent analysis of credit requests and the management of problem credits. The Credit Department has developed and implemented analytical procedures for evaluating credit requests, has refined the Company s risk rating system, and continues to adapt and enhance the monitoring of the loan portfolio. The loan portfolio analysis process is intended to contribute to the identification of weaknesses before they become more severe. 
 A special mention loan has potential weaknesses deserving of management s attention. If uncorrected, such weaknesses may, at a future date, impair the repayment prospects for the asset or our credit position. 
 Loans that are deemed special mention, substandard, doubtful or loss are listed in the Bank s Problem Loan Status Report. The Problem Loan Status Report provides a detailed summary of the borrower and guarantor status, loan accrual status, collateral evaluation and includes a description of the planned collection and administration program designed to mitigate the Bank s risk of loss and remove the loan from problem status. The Special Asset Committee reviews the Problem Loan Status Report on a quarterly basis for borrowers with an overall loan exposure in excess of 250,000. 
 At September 30, 2024, the recorded investment in individually assessed loans was 15.5 million, requiring a specific reserve of 1.0 million. At December 31, 2023, the recorded investment in individually assessed loans was 16.0 million, requiring a specific reserve of 0.4 million. The 16.0 million of individually assessed loans at December 31, 2023 included a single multi-unit residential real estate loan secured by four properties with a balance of 7.6 million at December 31, 2023. 
 Allowance for Credit Losses 
 We maintain an ACL that represents management s estimate of expected credit losses and risks inherent in our loan portfolio. The balance of the ACL is based on internally assigned risk classifications of loans, historical loss rates, changes in the nature of our loan portfolio, overall portfolio quality, industry concentrations, delinquency trends, current economic factors and the estimated impact of current economic conditions on certain historical loss rates. 
 A major consideration in the determination of the ACL on the credit card portfolio is based on historical loss experience in that portfolio. The Company calculates the credit card ACL collectively, applying segmentation based on collateral positions: secured, partially secured, and unsecured. 
 The following table presents key ratios for the ACL and nonaccrual loans for the periods indicated:

 As the loan portfolio and ACL review processes continue to evolve, there may be changes to elements of the allowance and this may influence the overall level of the allowance maintained. Historically, the Bank has enjoyed a high-quality loan portfolio with relatively low levels of net charge-offs and low delinquency rates. The maintenance of a high-quality portfolio will continue to be a priority. 
 Although we believe we have established our ACL in accordance with GAAP and that the ACL is currently adequate to provide for known and inherent losses in the portfolio at all times shown above, future provisions for credit losses will be subject to ongoing evaluations of the risks in our loan portfolio. 
 The following table shows the allocation of the ACL among loan categories as of the dates indicated. The total allowance is available to absorb losses from any loan category.

 Total Liabilities 
 Total liabilities at September 30, 2024 increased 309.4 million from December 31, 2023, primarily due to growth in the deposit portfolio of 290.2 million. 
 Deposits 
 Deposits are a major source of funding for the Company. We offer a variety of deposit products including interest-bearing demand, savings, money market and time accounts, all of which we actively market at competitive pricing. We generate deposits from our customers on a relationship basis and through the efforts of our commercial and business banking officers. Our credit card customers are a significant source of low cost deposits. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, our credit card customers accounted for 170.8 million and 173.9 million, or 23.8 and 28.2 , respectively, of our total noninterest-bearing deposit balances.

 Deposit costs increased 50 basis points during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 due, in large part, to a series of interest rate increases implemented by the Federal Reserve beginning in early 2022 and the corresponding move from savings accounts to higher rate money market accounts and time deposits. In addition, average noninterest-bearing deposit balances for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 2.0 million when compared to the year ended December 31, 2023, as growth in the number of customer accounts and corresponding balances outpaced the decision by some depositors to move balances from noninterest-bearing deposit accounts to interest-bearing deposit accounts. 
 The following table presents the maturities of our certificates of deposit as of September 30, 2024.

 At September 30, 2024, the Company had 511.3 million in total time deposits, an increase of 100.3 million from December 31, 2023. Total brokered time deposits of 153.0 million at September 30, 2024 increased 10.6 million from 142.4 million at December 31, 2023. Total brokered time deposits as a percentage of total deposits was 7.0 at September 30, 2024. 
 As of September 30, 2024 based on the methodologies and assumptions used for the Bank s regulatory reporting requirements, approximately 973.9 million, or 44.5 of the deposit portfolio was uninsured. As of December 31, 2023 approximately 789.4 million, or 41.6 , of the deposit portfolio was uninsured. Uninsured deposits are comprised of the portion of account balances that are in excess of FDIC insurance limits. 
 Deposits securing our OpenSky card lines of credit and deposits from title companies represent the largest concentrations in the deposit portfolio. As of September 30, 2024, these deposits represented 8 and 14 of deposits, respectively. As of December 31, 2023, these concentrations were 9 and 12 of deposits, respectively. 
 56 

Borrowings 
 We utilize short-term and long-term borrowings to supplement deposits to fund our lending and investment activities, each of which is discussed below. 
 FHLB Advances . The FHLB allows us to borrow up to 25 of our assets on a blanket floating lien status collateralized by certain securities and loans. As of September 30, 2024, approximately 597.4 million in real estate loans were pledged as collateral to the FHLB and our total borrowing capacity from the FHLB was 443.1 million. As of September 30, 2024, no investment securities were pledged with the FHLB. We utilize these borrowings to meet liquidity needs and to fund certain fixed rate loans in our portfolio. As of September 30, 2024, we had 52.0 million in outstanding advances and 391.1 million in available borrowing capacity from the FHLB. 
 Other Borrowed Funds. The Company has also issued junior subordinated debentures and other subordinated notes. At September 30, 2024, these other borrowings amounted to 12.1 million, consisting of Floating Rate Junior Subordinated Deferrable Interest Debentures and subordinated notes. 
 At September 30, 2024, our Floating Rate Junior Subordinated Deferrable Interest Debentures amounted to 2.1 million. The Floating Rate Junior Subordinated Deferrable Interest Debentures (the Floating Rate Debentures were issued in June of 2006, mature on June 15, 2036, and may be redeemed prior to that date under certain circumstances. The principal amount of the Floating Rate Debentures has not changed since issuance, and they accrue interest at a floating rate equal to the three-month CME Term SOFR plus a spread adjustment of 0.26161 (or 26.161 bps) plus 187 basis points, payable quarterly. As of September 30, 2024, the rate for the Floating Rate Debentures was 7.08 . 
 On November 30, 2020, the Company issued 10.0 million in subordinated notes due in 2030 (the Notes ). The Notes have a ten year term and have a fixed rate of 5.00 for the first five years; thereafter, the rate resets quarterly to a benchmark rate, which is expected to be the three-month SOFR, plus 490 basis points. The Notes may be redeemed in part or in whole, upon the occurrence of certain events. 
 Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond. The Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond has an available borrower in custody arrangement which allows us to borrow on a collateralized basis. The Company s borrowing capacity under the Federal Reserve s discount window program was 109.2 million as of September 30, 2024. Certain commercial loans are pledged under this arrangement. During the first quarter of 2023, we established a line of credit under the Federal Reserve Bank s Bank Term Funding Program BTFP ). As of March 31, 2024, participation in the BTFP had concluded and the Company had no outstanding balances under the BTFP at September 30, 2024. 
 The Company also has available lines of credit of 76.0 million with other correspondent banks at September 30, 2024, as well as access to certificate of deposit funding through financial intermediaries. There were no outstanding balances on the lines of credit from correspondent banks at September 30, 2024. 
 
 Liquidity 
 Liquidity is defined as the Bank s capacity to meet its cash and collateral obligations at a reasonable cost. Maintaining an adequate level of liquidity depends on the Bank s ability to meet both expected and unexpected cash flows and collateral needs efficiently without adversely affecting either daily operations or the financial condition of the Bank. Liquidity risk is the risk that we will be unable to meet our obligations as they become due because of an inability to liquidate assets or obtain adequate funding. The Bank s obligations, and the funding sources used to meet them, depend significantly on our business mix, balance sheet structure and the cash flow profiles of our on- and off-balance sheet obligations. In managing our cash flows, management regularly addresses situations that can give rise to increased liquidity risk. These include funding mismatches, market constraints on the ability to convert assets into 
 57 

cash or in accessing sources of funds (i.e., market liquidity) and contingent liquidity events. Changes in economic conditions or exposure to credit, market, operational, legal and reputational risks also could affect the Bank s liquidity risk profile and are considered in the assessment of liquidity and asset/liability management. 
 Management has established a risk management process for identifying, measuring, monitoring and controlling liquidity risk. Because of its critical importance to the viability of the Bank, liquidity risk management is integrated into our risk management processes. Critical elements of our liquidity risk management include: corporate governance consisting of oversight by the board of directors and active involvement by management; strategies, policies, procedures, and limits used to manage and mitigate liquidity risk; liquidity risk measurement and monitoring systems (including assessments of the current and prospective cash flows or sources and uses of funds) that are believed to be commensurate with the complexity and business activities of the Bank; active management of intraday liquidity and collateral; a diverse mix of existing and potential future funding sources; holding liquid marketable securities that can be used to meet liquidity needs in situations of stress; contingency funding plans that address potential adverse liquidity events and emergency cash flow requirements; and internal controls and internal audit processes believed to be sufficient to assure the adequacy of the institution s liquidity risk management process. 
 We expect funds to be available from a number of basic banking activity sources, including the core deposit base, the repayment and maturity of loans and investment security cash flows. Other potential funding sources include brokered certificates of deposit, deposit listing services, CDARS, borrowings from the FHLB and other lines of credit. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 391.1 million of available borrowing capacity from the FHLB, 109.2 million of available borrowing capacity from the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond Borrower in Custody program and available lines of credit of 76.0 million with other correspondent banks. Further, unpledged investment securities available as collateral for potential additional borrowings totaled 115.4 million at September 30, 2024. Cash and cash equivalents were 156.7 million at September 30, 2024. 
 
 Capital Resources 
 Stockholders equity increased 25.3 million for the period ended September 30, 2024 compared to December 31, 2023 largely due to net income of 23.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. In connection with the acquisition of IFHI, the Company temporarily suspended repurchases under its stock repurchase program during the first quarter 2024. 
 The Company s total stockholders equity is affected by fluctuations in the fair values of investment securities available-for-sale. The difference between amortized cost and fair value of investment securities, net of deferred income tax, is included in accumulated other comprehensive loss within stockholders equity. Accumulated other comprehensive loss is excluded from the Bank s and Company s regulatory capital ratios. The balance in accumulated other comprehensive loss related to unrealized losses on available-for-sale debt securities, net of deferred income tax, amounted to 8.6 million at September 30, 2024 and 13.1 million at December 31, 2023. Changes in accumulated other comprehensive loss are excluded from earnings and directly increase or decrease stockholders equity. To the extent unrealized losses on investment securities available-for-sale result from credit losses, unrealized losses are recorded as a charge against earnings. The investment securities section of the MD A and Notes 1 and 4 to the Notes to the Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements provide additional information concerning management s evaluation of investment securities available-for-sale for credit losses at September 30, 2024.

The Company uses several indicators of capital strength. The most commonly used measure is common equity to total assets (computed as equity divided by total assets), which was 10.94 at September 30, 2024 and 11.45 at December 31, 2023. 
 The Bank is subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can precipitate certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a material effect on the Company s financial condition. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, the Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of its assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. The capital amounts and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators. 
 Quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require the Bank to maintain minimum ratios of common equity Tier 1, Tier 1, and total capital as a percentage of assets and off-balance sheet exposures, adjusted for risk weights ranging from 0 to 1,250 . The Bank is also required to maintain capital at a minimum level based on quarterly average assets, which is known as the leverage ratio. 
 In July 2013, federal bank regulatory agencies issued a final rule that revised their risk-based capital requirements and the method for calculating risk-weighted assets to make them consistent with certain standards that were developed by Basel III and certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. The final rule applies to all depository institutions and bank holding companies and savings and loan holding companies with total consolidated assets of more than 1 billion. The Bank was required to implement the new Basel III capital standards (subject to the phase-in for certain parts of the new rules) as of January 1, 2015. In August of 2018 the Regulatory Relief Act directed the Federal Reserve Board to revise the Small BHC Policy Statement to raise the total consolidated asset limit in the Small BHC Policy Statement from 1 billion to 3 billion. The Company is currently exempt from the consolidated capital requirements. 
 The ability of the Company to continue to grow is dependent on its earnings and those of the Bank, and the ability to obtain additional funds for contribution to the Bank s capital, through additional borrowings, through the sale of additional common stock or preferred stock, or through the issuance of additional qualifying capital instruments, such as subordinated debt. The capital levels required to be maintained by the Company and Bank may be impacted as a result of the Bank s concentrations in commercial real estate loans. See "Risks Related to the Regulation of Our Industry in Part I, Item 1A - Risk Factors in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Bank was in compliance with all applicable regulatory capital requirements to which it was subject, and the Bank was classified as well capitalized for purposes of the prompt corrective action regulations. As we deploy our capital and continue to grow our operations, our regulatory capital levels may decrease depending on our level of earnings. However, we intend to monitor and control our growth relative to our earnings in order to remain in compliance with all regulatory capital standards applicable to us.

 Contractual Obligations 
 We have contractual obligations to make future payments on debt agreements. Our liquidity monitoring and management consider both present and future demands for and sources of liquidity. 
 Off-Balance Sheet Items 
 In the normal course of business, we enter into various transactions that, in accordance with GAAP, are not included in our consolidated balance sheets. We enter into these transactions to meet the financing needs of our customers. These transactions include commitments to extend credit and issue letters of credit, which involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit risk and interest rate risk in excess of the amounts recognized in our consolidated balance sheets. Our exposure to credit loss is represented by the contractual amounts of these commitments. The same credit policies and procedures are generally used in making these commitments as for on-balance sheet instruments. We are not aware of any accounting loss to be incurred by funding these commitments; however, we maintain a reserve for unfunded commitments and certain off-balance sheet credit risks, which is recorded in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. 
 Our commitments associated with outstanding letters of credit and commitments to extend credit expiring by period as of the date indicated are summarized below. Since commitments associated with letters of credit and commitments to extend credit may expire unused, the amounts shown do not necessarily reflect actual future cash funding requirements. 
 60 

As of September 30, 2024 As of December 31, 2023 (in thousands) Unfunded lines of credit 403,540 336,472 Letters of credit 4,633 4,641 Commitment to fund other investments 3,034 3,874 Total credit extension commitments 411,207 344,987 
 Unfunded lines of credit represent unused credit facilities to our current borrowers. Lines of credit generally have variable interest rates. Letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by us to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. In the event of nonperformance by the customer in accordance with the terms of the agreement with the third party, we would be required to fund the commitment. The maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make is represented by the contractual amount of the commitment. If the commitment is funded, we would be entitled to seek recovery from the customer from the underlying collateral, which can include commercial real estate, physical plant and property, inventory, receivables, cash and/or marketable securities. Our policies generally require that letter of credit arrangements contain security and debt covenants similar to those contained in loan agreements. We believe the credit risk associated with issuing letters of credit is substantially the same as the risk involved in extending loan facilities to our customers. 
 We seek to minimize our exposure to loss under letters of credit and credit commitments by subjecting them to the same credit approval and monitoring procedures as we do for on-balance sheet instruments. The effect on our revenue, expenses, cash flows and liquidity of the unused portions of these letters of credit commitments cannot be precisely predicted because we do not control the extent to which the lines of credit may be used. 
 Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend funds to a customer, as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Commitments generally have variable interest rates, fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. Since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being fully drawn, the total commitment amounts disclosed above do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. We evaluate each customer s creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral obtained, if considered necessary by us, upon extension of credit is based on management s credit evaluation of the customer. 
 We enter into forward commitments for the delivery of mortgage loans in our current pipeline. Interest rate lock commitments are entered into in order to economically hedge the effect of changes in interest rates resulting from our commitments to fund the loans. These commitments to fund mortgage loans to be sold into the secondary market, along with the interest rate lock commitments and forward commitments for the future delivery of mortgage loans to third party investors, are considered derivatives. 
 The commitment to fund other investments reflects an obligation to make an investment in a Small Business Investment Company. 
 Impact of Inflation 
 The consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. GAAP requires the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars, without considering changes in the relative value of money over time due to inflation or recession. 
 Unlike many industrial companies, substantially all of the Company s assets and liabilities are monetary in nature. As a result, interest rates have a more significant impact on our performance than the effects of general levels of inflation. Interest rates may not necessarily move in the same direction or in 
 61 

the same magnitude as the prices of goods and services. However, most other operating expenses are sensitive to changes in levels of inflation. 
 
 Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Reconciliations 
 The Company has presented the following non-GAAP financial measures because it believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors because they are used by management to evaluate our operating performance and make day-to-day operating decisions. In addition, we believe our non-GAAP results in any given reporting period reflect our on-going financial performance in that period and, accordingly, are useful to consider in addition to our GAAP financial results. We further believe the presentation of non-GAAP results increases comparability of period-to-period results. 
 Other companies may use similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures that may be calculated differently from the way we calculate such measures. Accordingly, our non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similar measures used by such companies. We caution investors not to place undue reliance on such non-GAAP financial measures, but to consider them with the most directly comparable GAAP measures. Non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for our results reported under GAAP.

Item 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 
 Interest Rate Sensitivity and Market Risk 
 As a financial institution, our primary component of market risk is interest rate volatility. Our asset liability and funds management policy provides management with the guidelines for funds management, and we have established a measurement system for monitoring our net interest rate sensitivity position . We endeavor to manage our sensitivity position within our established guidelines. 
 Fluctuations in interest rates will ultimately impact both the level of income and the market value of all interest earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, other than those that have a short term to maturity. Interest rate risk is the potential of economic losses due to future interest rate changes. These economic losses can be reflected as a loss of future net interest income and/or a loss of current fair market values. The objective is to measure the effect on net interest income and to adjust the balance sheet to minimize the inherent risk while at the same time maximizing income. 
 We endeavor to manage our exposure to interest rates by structuring our balance sheet in the ordinary course of business. We do not enter into instruments such as leveraged derivatives, financial options or financial futures contracts for the purpose of reducing interest rate risk. We endeavor to hedge the interest rate risks of our available-for-sale mortgage pipeline by using mortgage-backed securities, and short positions. Based on the nature of our operations, we are not subject to foreign exchange or commodity price risk. We do not own any trading assets. 
 Our exposure to interest rate risk is managed by the Bank s Asset/Liability Management Committee ALCO in accordance with policies approved by our board of directors. The ALCO formulates strategies based on perceived levels of interest rate risk. In determining the appropriate level of interest rate risk, the committee considers the impact on earnings and capital of the current outlook for interest rates, potential changes in interest rates, regional economies, liquidity, business strategies and other factors. The ALCO meets regularly to review, among other things, the sensitivity of assets and liabilities to interest rate changes, the book and market values of assets and liabilities, unrealized gains and losses, purchase and sale activities, commitments to originate loans and the maturities of investments and borrowings. Additionally, the ALCO reviews liquidity, cash flow flexibility, maturities of deposits and consumer and commercial deposit activity. Management employs methodologies to manage interest rate risk, which include an analysis of relationships between interest earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and an interest rate shock simulation model. 
 The following table indicates that, for periods less than one year, rate-sensitive assets exceeded rate-sensitive liabilities, resulting in an asset-sensitive position. For a bank with an asset-sensitive position, or positive gap, rising interest rates would generally be expected to have a positive effect on net interest income, and falling interest rates would generally be expected to have the opposite effect.

 We use quarterly Earnings at Risk EAR simulations to assess the impact of changing interest rates on our earnings under a variety of scenarios and time horizons. These simulations utilize both instantaneous and parallel changes in the level of interest rates, as well as non-parallel changes such as changing slopes and twists of the yield curve. Static simulation models are based on current exposures and assume a constant balance sheet with no new growth. Dynamic simulation models are also utilized that rely on assumptions regarding changes in existing lines of business, new business, and changes in management and client behavior. 
 We also use economic value-based methodologies to measure the degree to which the economic values of the Bank s positions change under different interest rate scenarios. The economic-value approach focuses on a longer-term time horizon and endeavors to capture all future cash flows expected from existing assets and liabilities. The economic value model utilizes a static approach in that the analysis does not incorporate new business; rather, the analysis shows a snapshot in time of the risk inherent in the balance sheet. 
 66 

Many assumptions are used to calculate the impact of interest rate fluctuations on our net interest income, such as asset prepayments, non-maturity deposit price sensitivity and decay rates, and key rate drivers. Because of the inherent use of these estimates and assumptions in the model, our actual results may, and very likely will, differ from our static EAR results. In addition, static EAR results do not include actions that our management may undertake to manage the risks in response to anticipated changes in interest rates or client behavior. For example, as part of our asset/liability management strategy, management has the ability to increase asset duration and decrease liability duration in order to reduce asset sensitivity, or to decrease asset duration and increase liability duration in order to increase asset sensitivity. 
 The following table summarizes the results of our EAR analysis in simulating the change in net interest income and fair value of equity over a 12-month horizon as of September 30, 2024:

 Utilizing an economic value of equity EVE approach, we analyze the risk to capital from the effects of various interest rate scenarios through a long-term discounted cash flow model. This measures the difference between the economic value of our assets and the economic value of our liabilities, which is a proxy for our liquidation value. While this provides some value as a risk measurement tool, management believes EAR is more appropriate in accordance with the going concern principle.
