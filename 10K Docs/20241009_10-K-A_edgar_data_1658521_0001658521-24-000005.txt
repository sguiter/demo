REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
 
 To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Mountain Top Properties, Inc. 
 
 Opinion on the Financial Statements 
 
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Mountain Top Properties, Inc. (the Company) as of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders deficit, and cash flows for each of the two years ended December 31, 2023, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of year ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the two years ended December 31, 2023, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
 
 Substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern 
 
 The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 3 to the financial statements, the Company has suffered recurring losses since inception, has a shareholders deficit, and the Company and has not completed its efforts to establish a stabilized source of revenues sufficient to cover operating costs over an extended period of time these factors raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management's plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 3. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 
 
 Basis for Opinion 
 
 These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 
 
 Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and 

www.vmcpafirm.com | Ph: 713.588.6622 | Fax: 1.833.694.1494 | ask@vmcpafirm.com 

significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 
 Critical Audit Matters 
 
 A critical audit matter is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee or the Company s governance and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating a critical audit, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. We determined that there are no critical audit matters communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee. 

We have served as the Company s auditor since 2022.

ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE 
 
 None. 
 
 ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 
 Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Under the supervision of our Chief Executive Officer, the Company conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023 using the criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).

A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. In its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, the Company determined that there were control deficiencies that constituted material weaknesses under COSO and SEC rules are, as described below:

(1) lack of a functioning audit committee and lack of a majority of independent directors on the Company s board of directors, resulting in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures; (2) inadequate segregation of duties consistent with control objectives; and (3) insufficient written policies and procedures for accounting and financial reporting with respect to the requirements and application of US GAAP and SEC disclosure requirements. The aforementioned potential material weaknesses were identified by the Company s Chief Financial Officer in connection with the preparation of our financial statements as of December 31, 2023 and communicated the matters to our management and board of directors.

Management is currently evaluating remediation plans for the above control deficiency.

Accordingly, the Company concluded that this control deficiency resulted in a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by the company s internal controls.

As a result of the material weaknesses described above, management has concluded that the Company did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023 based on criteria established in 
 Internal Control Integrated Framework
 issued by COSO.
