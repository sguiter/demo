 per share (the Common Stock ), at a ratio of one (1) share of Common Stock for twenty-five (25) shares of Common Stock (the Reverse Stock Split ). The Reverse Stock Split was effective on August 26, 2024 (the Effective Time ). As a result of the Reverse Stock Split, each twenty-five (25) pre-split shares of Common Stock outstanding automatically combined into one (1) new share of Common Stock without any action on the part of the holders, and the number of outstanding shares of common stock was reduced from shares to shares (subject to rounding of fractional shares) and the number of authorized shares of Common Stock was reduced from share to shares. Stockholders who otherwise were entitled to receive fractional shares because they held a number of pre-reverse stock split shares of Common Stock not evenly divisible by 25, received, in lieu of a fractional share, that number of shares rounded up to the nearest whole share. The Reverse Stock Split did not alter the par value of the Common Stock or modify any voting rights or other terms of the Common Stock. In addition, pursuant to their terms, a proportionate adjustment was made to the per share conversion exercise price and number of shares issuable under all of the Company s outstanding shares of convertible preferred stock and stock options and warrants to purchase shares of Common Stock, and the number of shares authorized and reserved for issuance pursuant to the Company s equity incentive plans was reduced proportionately. All share amounts and exercise/conversion prices in the condensed consolidated financial statements and footnotes below have been adjusted retrospectively for the Reverse Stock Split. The condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP, which requires the use of estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the amounts of assets and liabilities at the reporting date and the amounts of revenue and expenses in the periods presented. The Company believes that the accounting estimates employed are appropriate and the resulting balances are reasonable; however, due to the inherent uncertainties in making estimates, actual results may differ from the original estimates, requiring adjustments to these balances in future periods. As of September 30, 2024, the Company has operating segment (which includes the legacy Company business and the VCN business) and therefore reporting segment.

 million. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. Since inception, the Company has financed its activities principally from the proceeds from the issuance of equity securities. The Company s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the Company s ability to raise additional debt and equity capital. There can be no assurance that such capital will be available in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to the Company. The accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability of the recorded assets or the classification of liabilities that may be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. The Company does not have sufficient capital to fund its operations beyond the date that is twelve months from the date of the filing of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. In order to address the Company s capital needs, including its planned clinical trials, the Company is actively pursuing additional equity or debt financing in the form of either a private placement or a public offering. The Company has been in ongoing discussions with strategic institutional investors and investment banks with respect to such possible offerings. Such additional financing opportunities might not be available to the Company when and if needed, on acceptable terms or at all. If the Company is unable to obtain additional financing in sufficient amounts or on acceptable terms under such circumstances, the Company s operating results and prospects will be adversely affected. At September 30, 2024, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of approximately million. Based upon the Company s current business plans, management believes that the Company s current cash on hand will be sufficient to fully execute its plans into the third quarter of 2025. Commencement of planned future clinical trials is subject to the Company s successful pursuit of opportunities that will allow it to establish the clinical infrastructure and financial resources necessary to successfully initiate and complete its plan. The Company anticipates its current cash will allow it to cover overhead costs, manufacturing costs for near-term clinical supply and limited research efforts, including completing its funding requirements for its ongoing current trials for VCN-01. The Company will be required to obtain additional funding in order to continue the development of its current product candidates within the anticipated time periods (including initiation of its planned future clinical trials), if at all, and to continue to fund operations at the current cash expenditure levels. Currently, the Company does not have commitments from any third parties to provide it with capital. Potential sources of financing include strategic relationships, public or private sales of equity (including through its at the market offering sales agreement (the ATM Sales Agreement )) or debt and other sources. The Company cannot assure that it will meet the requirements for use of the ATM Sales Agreement or that additional funding will be available on favorable terms at all. If the Company fails to obtain additional funding for its clinical trials, whether through the sale of securities or a partner or collaborator, and otherwise when needed, it will not be able to execute its business plan as planned and will be forced to cease certain development activities (including initiation of planned clinical trials) until funding is received and its business will suffer, which would have a material adverse effect on its financial position, results of operations and cash flows. The actual amount of funds the Company will need to operate is subject to many factors, some of which are beyond its control. These factors include the following: the progress of its research activities; the number and scope of its research programs; the ability to recruit patients for clinical studies in a timely manner; the progress of its preclinical and clinical development activities; the progress of the development efforts of parties with whom the Company has entered into research and development agreements and amount of funding received from partners and collaborators; its ability to maintain current research and development licensing arrangements and to establish new research and development and licensing arrangements;

 period. The Company accounts for the reimbursement as a tax credit receivable related to amounts that had been approved by the Spanish government and a corresponding deferred research and development tax credit as it was determined that amounts became probable of being received upon the receipt of the approval. Additionally, the Company has elected to account for the tax credit as a contra-expense as this most appropriately reflects the nature of the transaction and will reduce future research and development expenditures as the Company continues to incur expenses in the upcoming 24-month period.

In-process R D impairment ) Effects of exchange rates Balance at September 30, 2024 During the three and nine months ending September 30, 2024, the Company experienced a sustained decline in the quoted market price of the Company s Common Stock and the Company deemed this to be a triggering event for impairment. The Company performed an interim impairment analysis using both the replacement cost method and the Income approach that requires significant judgments, including primarily the estimation of future development costs, the probability of success in various phases of its development programs, potential post-launch cash flows and a risk-adjusted weighted average cost of capital. For the three and nine months ending September 30, 2024, the Company concluded that the in-process R D with a carrying value of million was impaired and was written down to its estimated fair value of million and an impairment charge of million was recorded. For the three and nine months ending September 30, 2024, the Company concluded that goodwill with a carrying value of million was impaired and was written down to its estimated fair value of and an impairment charge of million and million, respectively, was recorded.

 million in additional consideration upon the achievement of certain milestones, including regulatory filings completed. In August 2023, the Company initiated patient dosing in the U.S. in its Phase 2 clinical trial of VCN-01 in PDAC. As a result, payment was made in the third quarter 2023 in the amount of million. The discounted cash flow method used to value this contingent consideration includes inputs of not readily observable market data, which are Level 3 inputs. The fair value of the contingent consideration was million as of September 30, 2024 and is all reflected as non-current contingent consideration liability. During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recognized in operating expense a increase and million decrease, respectfully, fair value adjustment to contingent consideration. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recognized in operating expense a increase and million decrease, respectfully, fair value adjustment to contingent consideration. There were no transfers in or out of the level 3 liabilities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The following table summarizes the change in the fair value as determined by Level 3 inputs for the contingent consideration liabilities as of December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2024: Payment of contingent consideration ) Change in fair value ) Balance at December 31, 2023 Contingent consideration, current portion Contingent consideration, net of current portion Balance at December 31, 2023

 million was written down to its estimated fair value of million and an impairment charge of million was recorded, and goodwill with a carrying value of million was written down to its estimated fair value of and an impairment charge of million was recorded. For the quarter ending June 30, 2024, goodwill with a carrying value of million was written down to its estimated fair value of million and an impairment charge of million was recorded. This analysis requires significant judgments, including primarily the estimation of future development costs, the probability of success in various phases of its development programs, potential post-launch cash flows and a risk-adjusted weighted average cost of capital. The fair value of the Company s reporting unit was determined using an income approach that utilizes a discounted cash flow model. The discounted cash flow models are dependent upon the Company s estimates of future cash flows and other factors. The Company s estimates of future cash flows are based on a comprehensive product by product forecast over a period which covers Phase 1 to approval and 15 years of commercialized revenue and involve assumptions concerning (i) future operating performance, including research and development costs through approval of the drug, the future addressable market, future sales, long-term growth rates, operating margins, allocation and timing of cash flows and the probability of achieving the estimated cash flows and (ii) future economic conditions, all which may differ from actual future cash flows. Assumptions related to future operating performance are based on management s annual and ongoing budgeting, forecasting and planning processes and represent the Company s best estimate of the future results of its operations as of a point in time. These estimates are subject to many assumptions, such as the economic environments in which it operates, demand for the products and competitor actions. Estimated future cash flows are discounted to present value using a market participant, weighted average cost of capital, which considers the risk inherent in the probability adjusted future cash flows from each product. The financial and credit market volatility directly impacts certain inputs and assumptions used to develop the weighted average cost of capital such as the risk-free interest rate, industry beta, debt interest rate and the Company s market capital structure. These assumptions are based on significant inputs not observable in the market and thus represent Level 3 measurements within the fair value hierarchy. The use of different inputs and assumptions could increase or decrease the Company s estimated discounted future cash flows, the resulting estimated fair values and the amounts of related goodwill impairments, if any.

 period. In the quarter ended June 30, 2023, the Company completed the certification and applied for direct reimbursement, as opposed to a tax credit, for its qualifying research and development expenses incurred in the year ended December 31, 2022. The Company received approvals from the Spanish government in September and October 2023. During the quarter ended June 30, 2024, the Company completed the certification and applied for direct reimbursement for its qualifying research and development expenses incurred in the year ended December 31, 2023. The Company evaluated the program and concluded that it qualified to be accounted for as government assistance. Accordingly, the Company, as allowed by U.S. GAAP, elected to account for the grant by analogizing to the guidance provided by International Accounting Standards IAS 20, Accounting for Government Grants and Disclosure of Government Assistance. Accordingly, the Company recognized a tax credit receivable of million related to amounts that had been approved by the Spanish government and a corresponding deferred research and development tax credit current portion of and a deferred research and development tax credit non-current portion of , as it was determined that amounts became probable of being received upon the receipt of the approval. Additionally, the Company has elected to account for the tax credit as a contra-expense as this most appropriately reflects the nature of the transaction and will reduce future research and development expenditures as the Company continues to incur expenses in the upcoming 24-month period. During the three and nine months ending September 30, 2024 the Company recorded and , respectively, as a reduction in research and development expense.

Expected dividends The Company has never declared or paid dividends on its Common Stock and has no plans to do so in the foreseeable future. Expected volatility Volatility is a measure of the amount by which a financial variable such as a share price has fluctuated (historical volatility) or is expected to fluctuate (expected volatility) during a period. The expected volatility assumption is derived from the historical volatility of the Company s Common Stock over a period approximately equal to the expected term. Risk-free interest rate The assumed risk-free rate used is a zero coupon U.S. Treasury security with a maturity that approximates the expected term of the option. Expected life of the option The period of time that the options granted are expected to remain unexercised. Options granted during the prior year have a maximum term of seven years. The Company estimates the expected life of the option term based on the weighted average life between the dates that options become fully vested and the maximum life of options granted. The Company records stock-based compensation based upon the stated vesting provisions in the related agreements. The vesting provisions for these agreements have various terms as follows: immediate vesting, in full on the one-year anniversary date of the grant date, half vesting immediately and the remaining over three years, quarterly over three years, annually over three years,

 ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, and our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto for the year ended December 31, 2023 included in our 2023 Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements reflecting our current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties. See Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements for a discussion of the uncertainties, risks and assumptions associated with these statements. Our actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements due to important factors and risks including, but not limited to, those set forth below under Risk Factors and elsewhere herein, and those identified under Part I, Item 1A of our 2023 Form 10-K. All share amounts and exercise or conversion prices in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q have been adjusted retrospectively for our 1-for-25 reverse stock split, which was effective on August 26, 2024. Overview We are a diversified clinical-stage company developing therapeutics designed to treat cancer and related diseases in areas of high unmet need. As a result of the acquisition in March 2022 of Theriva Biologics, S.L. VCN , formerly named VCN Biosciences, S.L.), described in more detail below (the Acquisition ), we began transitioning our strategic focus to oncology, which is now our primary focus, through the development of VCN s new oncolytic adenovirus platform designed for intravenous and intravitreal delivery to trigger tumor cell death, to improve access of co-administered cancer therapies to the tumor, and to promote a robust and sustained anti-tumor response by the patient s immune system. Our lead product candidate, VCN-01, a clinical stage oncolytic human adenovirus that is modified for tumor-selective replication and to express an enzyme, PH20 hyaluronidase, is currently being evaluated in a Phase 2 clinical study for the treatment of pancreatic cancer VIRAGE ), and has recently been used to treat patients in a Phase 1 clinical study for the treatment of retinoblastoma, and Phase 1 clinical studies for the treatment of other solid tumors including head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. Prior to the Acquisition, our focus was on developing therapeutics designed to treat gastrointestinal (GI) diseases which included our clinical development candidates: (1) SYN-004 (ribaxamase) which is designed to degrade certain commonly used intravenous (IV) beta-lactam antibiotics within the GI tract to prevent microbiome damage, thereby preventing overgrowth and infection by pathogenic organisms such Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) and vancomycin resistant Enterococci (VRE), and reducing the incidence and severity of acute graft-versus-host-disease (aGVHD) in allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) recipients, and (2) SYN-020, a recombinant oral formulation of the enzyme intestinal alkaline phosphatase (IAP) produced under cGMP conditions and intended to treat both local GI and systemic diseases. As part of our strategic transformation into an oncology focused company, we are exploring value creation options for our SYN-004 and SYN-020 assets, including out-licensing or partnering. Recent Developments Reverse Stock Split On August 15, 2024, our Board of Directors approved a reverse stock split of our authorized, issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock, at a ratio of one (1) share of Common Stock for twenty-five (25) shares of Common Stock (the Reverse Stock Split ). The Reverse Stock Split was effective on August 26, 2024. Any share amounts and exercise or conversion prices in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q have been adjusted retrospectively for the Reverse Stock Split.

 Recent Clinical and Regulatory Developments On October 16, 2024, we announced that the European Commission has adopted the European Medicines Agency (EMA) recommendation to grant orphan medicinal product designation to lead clinical candidate VCN-01for the treatment of retinoblastoma. The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has previously granted orphan drug designation and rare pediatric disease designation to VCN-01 for the treatment of retinoblastoma. The EMA recommends orphan designation for products intended to treat, prevent or diagnose a disease that is life-threatening or chronically debilitating and either the prevalence of the condition in the European Union (EU) does not exceed 5 in 10,000 or it is unlikely that marketing of the product would generate sufficient returns to justify the investment needed for its development. Additionally, there should be no authorizable method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of the condition, or, if such a method exists, the medicine must be of significant benefit to those affected by the condition. Orphan designation is designed to provide drug developers with various benefits to support the development of novel therapies, including 10 years of market exclusivity once they receive marketing authorization in the EU, protocol assistance, administrative and procedural assistance, and reduced fees for regulatory activities. On October 3, 2024, we announced a positive outcome from the Data and Safety Monitoring Committee DSMC review of results from the second Cohort of our Phase 1b/2a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trial of SYN-004 (ribaxamase) in allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant HCT recipients for the prevention of acute graft-versus-host-disease. Based on a review of the safety and pharmacokinetic data, the DSMC has recommended that the study may proceed to enroll Cohort 3 in which study drug (SYN-004 or Placebo) will be administered in combination with the IV beta-lactam antibiotic cefepime. We are pursuing additional funding to enable the conduct of the third cohort. The Phase 1b/2a study is on-going and remains blinded; however, key findings from blinded data for Cohort 2 are included below: o Adverse events AEs and serious adverse events SAEs observed in Cohort 2 were typical of those observed in allo-HCT patients and no AEs or SAEs were determined by the investigators to be related to study drug treatment. o A total of 15 SAEs were reported among 10 patients, with the most common SAE being infections and infestations, including sepsis. o No patients died within the 30-day follow-up period after the last dose of study drug; 1 patient died 95 days and another 211 days after the last dose of study drug due to cancer relapse and pneumonia respectively (not related to study drug). 
 Consistent with the findings from Cohort 1 and previous studies of SYN-004 in healthy volunteers, no patient blood samples were positive for SYN-004 at any timepoint. The pharmacokinetics of piperacillin, which can be metabolized by SYN-004, were as expected for this patient population. 
 On September 23, 2024, we announced that we have achieved our target patient enrollment of 92 evaluable patients in the VIRAGE Phase 2b clinical trial evaluating the Company s lead product candidate VCN-01 plus standard-of-care SoC chemotherapy (gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel) as a first line therapy for patients with metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma PDAC ). The trial enrolled 46 or more patients in each of the control and VCN-01 treatment arms across 15 sites in Spain and the USA within 21 months.VCN-01 has been granted Orphan Drug Designation and Fast Track Designation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration FDA for the treatment of PDAC. Patients in the VCN-01 treatment arm of the VIRAGE trial are treated with two separate IV VCN-01 doses (1x10 13 vp/patient) administered approximately 3 months apart: the first VCN-01 dose is administered 7-days prior to initiation of the 1st gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel SoC chemotherapy cycle; the second VCN-01 dose is administered 7-days prior to initiation of the 4th gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel SoC chemotherapy cycle. The VCN-01 dose used in the VIRAGE trial was determined in a previously reported Phase 1 dose-escalation study where patients administered a single dose of VCN-01 (1x10 13 vp/patient) 7-days prior to initiation of gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel SoC chemotherapy cycles (n=6) showed an overall response rate of 83 , with a median progression free survival of 6.3 months and median overall of 20.8 months. A total of 26 patients were administered different doses of VCN-01 in the Phase 1 study, and the most common treatment-related adverse events were dose-dependent and reversible pyrexia, flu-like symptoms, and increases in liver transaminases.

 On July 30, 2024, we received notice from the FDA that we had been granted Rare Pediatric Drug Designation (RPDD) for VCN-01 for the treatment of retinoblastoma. The FDA grants RPDD for rare diseases (fewer than 200,000 affected persons in the United States) that are serious and life-threatening and primarily affect children ages 18 years or younger. If a Biologics License Application for VCN-01 for the treatment of retinoblastoma is approved by the FDA, Theriva may be eligible to receive a Priority Review Voucher. Previously, the FDA granted orphan drug designation to VCN-01 for treatment of retinoblastoma. Our Current Oncology-Focused Pipeline Oncolytic Viruses Our oncology platform is based on oncolytic virotherapy OV therapy ), which exploits the ability of certain viruses to kill tumor cells and trigger an anti-tumor immune response. This novel class of anticancer agents has unique mechanisms of action compared to other cancer drugs. Oncolytic viruses OV exploit the fact that cancer cells contain mutations that cause them to lose growth control and form tumors. Once inside a tumor cell, oncolytic viruses exploit the tumor cell machinery to generate thousands of additional copies of the virus, which then kill the tumor cell and spread to neighboring cells, causing a chain reaction of cell killing. This infection and tumor cell killing by OVs also alerts the immune system, which can then attack the virus infected tumor cells to help destroy the tumor in some instances. Our OV product candidates are engineered to efficiently infect and selectively replicate to a high extent in tumor cells versus normal host cells, which enables intravenous delivery. By contrast, many other oncolytic viruses in clinical development today are administered by direct injection into the tumor. Intravenous delivery has the potential to expand the therapeutic effect of OVs because the virus can infect both the primary tumor and tumor metastases throughout the body. Our first product candidate, VCN-01, is a clinical stage oncolytic human adenovirus that is modified to express an enzyme, PH20 hyaluronidase, that degrades hyaluronan in the tumor stroma, which helps the virus and other molecules to penetrate and spread throughout the tumor. VCN-01 can be used alone or in combination with other cancer therapies, such as chemotherapy and immunotherapy, for difficult to treat cancers. An expanding intellectual property portfolio supports our oncology programs, and because our products are characterized as biologics with Orphan Drug designation in our target indications, they will be further protected by data and/or market exclusivity in major markets. VCN-01 has been administered to 142 patients across multiple Phase 1 clinical trials and the Phase 2 VIRAGE trial, including patients with pancreatic cancer, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, ovarian cancer, colorectal cancer, and retinoblastoma. Current clinical and Regulatory update We are currently conducting a Phase 2 trial of intravenous VCN-01 with or without nab-paclitaxel plus gemcitabine in patients with PDAC. Additional on-going investigator sponsored studies comprise a Phase 1 trial combining VCN-01 with huCART-meso cells in patients with pancreatic or serous epithelial ovarian cancer, and a Phase 1 trial evaluating the intravenous administration of VCN-01 in patients prior to surgical resection of high-grade brain tumors. Additionally, the Clinical Study Reports (CSRs) are being prepared for the Phase 1 Trial of intravenous VCN-01 in combination with durvalumab in subjects with recurrent/ metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (mSCCHN) and the Phase 1 trial evaluating intravitreal VCN-01 in patients with retinoblastoma. Phase 1 Clinical Trials in PDAC The safety, tolerability, and potential dosing regimens for VCN-01 in patients with PDAC or colorectal cancer were evaluated in Phase 1 clinical trials evaluating intratumoral (n=8; NCT02045589) and intravenous (n= 42; NCT02045602) VCN-01 either alone or in combination with gemcitabine nab-paclitaxel (published in J. Immunother. Cancer 2021 Nov;9(11):e003254 and J. Immunother. Cancer 2022 Mar;10(3):e003255, respectively). Intravenous VCN-01 was found to have an acceptable safety/tolerability profile in PDAC and colorectal cancer patients and demonstrated compelling biochemical and clinical outcomes that enabled the advancement of VCN-01 into Phase 2 clinical trial in patients with metastatic PDAC.

 Phase 2 Trial of intravenous VCN-01 with or without nab-paclitaxel plus gemcitabine in patients with PDAC In January 2023, we dosed the first patients in VIRAGE, the Phase 2b randomized, open-label, placebo-controlled, multicenter clinical trial of systemically administered VCN-01 in combination with standard-of-care (SoC) chemotherapy (gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel) as a first line therapy for patients with newly-diagnosed metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. The study is expected to be conducted at approximately 17 sites in the US and EU. Two doses of VCN-01 are included in the treatment arm: the 1st dose is administered on day 1, then one week later 3 cycles of gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel as standard of care is administered. The second VCN-01 dose is administered 7 days before the 4th cycle of chemotherapy (approximately 90 days after the first VCN-01 dose), followed by additional cycles of gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel chemotherapy. Patient dosing was initiated in the U.S. in July 2023 and on September 23, 2024, we announced that we have achieved our target patient enrollment of 92 evaluable patients in the VIRAGE Phase 2b clinical trial. Thirty patients have received their second doses of intravenous VCN-01, which were well tolerated and demonstrated the expected VCN-01 safety profile. On May 10, 2024, we presented data demonstrating enhanced anti-tumor effects in human pancreatic cancer xenograft-bearing mice treated with lead product candidate VCN-01 and liposomal irinotecan. These data support the potential synergy of VCN-01 and first-line pancreatic cancer chemotherapy regimens On May 23, 2024, we announced that the FDA granted Fast Track Designation (FTD) to lead clinical candidate VCN-01 in combination with gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel to improve progression-free survival and overall survival in patients with metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma. On June 1, 2024, we presented the design of VIRAGE trial in a poster at the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting 2024 Congress held and in Chicago (Illinois) from May 31- June 4, 2024. The poster discussed the objectives, endpoints and key inclusion and exclusion criteria included in the trial protocol, together with the treatment schedule for each arm of the study. On September 23, 2024, we announced that we have achieved our target patient enrollment of 92 evaluable patients in the VIRAGE Phase 2b clinical trial. Thirty patients have received their second doses of intravenous VCN-01, which were well tolerated and demonstrated the expected VCN-01 safety profile. According to the IDMC s assessment of clinical data from patients enrolled across 6 sites open in the U.S. and 9 sites open in Spain, the ongoing Phase 2b trial will continue without any changes to the protocol. No safety concerns were raised based on the evaluation of data presented at the IDMC meeting. Intravenous VCN-01 has been well tolerated and demonstrated a safety profile consistent with prior clinical trials. Importantly, no additional toxicities were observed in patients receiving a second dose of VCN-01, providing the first clinical evidence of the feasibility of repeated systemic dosing. Retinoblastoma Phase 1 Trial of intravitreal VCN-01 in patients with retinoblastoma During the third quarter of 2017, VCN entered into a Clinical Trial Agreement with Hospital Sant Joan de D u (Barcelona, Spain) to conduct an investigator sponsored Phase 1 clinical study evaluating the safety and tolerability of two intravitreal injections of VCN-01 in patients with intraocular retinoblastoma refractory to systemic, intra-arterial or intravitreal chemotherapy, or radiotherapy, in whom enucleation was the only recommended treatment (NCT03284268). Patients received two intravitreal injections of VCN-01, 14 days apart, at a dose of either 2 x 10 9 vp/eye (n=1) or 2 x 10 10 vp/eye (n=8). Enrollment, dosing and safety follow-up in this study have been completed and the clinical study report is being prepared. On April 23, 2024, we announced positive topline data from this study, with agreement by the study Monitoring Committee that the study had a positive outcome. VCN-01 was well tolerated after intravitreal administration at the 2 doses and the most frequently reported treatment-related adverse events were Grade 1 or 2. There were no dose limiting toxicities and no ocular or systemic toxicities equal to or greater than Grade 3 during the evaluation period. Some degree of ocular inflammation and associated turbidity was observed after VCN-01 injection. Inflammation was managed, and vitreous haze improved in some cases, by local and systemic administration of anti-inflammatory drugs.

 VCN-01 does not appear to change the retinal function, and selective VCN-01 replication in retinoblastoma cells has been observed by immunohistochemical analysis. Replication within retinoblastoma tumors over time was detected Intravitreal VCN-01 demonstrated promising antitumor activity: 
 o Four patients presented a response characterized by unequivocal improvement in vitreous seed density. o Eye enucleation was avoided in 3 patients to date, one of whom has retained their eye after 4 years of follow-up. 
 Per the terms of the clinical trial agreement, the determination by the study Monitoring Committee that the study had a positive outcome means we will receive an exclusive, worldwide technology license, and related patents from Hospital Sant Joan de D u for the treatment of pediatric patients with advanced retinoblastoma and we will pay to Hospital Sant Joan de D u the amount of three hundred twenty thousand Euros 320,000) or 345,000. A pre-Investigational New Drug IND meeting with the FDA was held on December 19, 2023 to discuss the path forward for VCN-01 as an adjunct to chemotherapy in pediatric patients with advanced retinoblastoma. The FDA provided some guidance on the potential endpoints and patient population for an advanced clinical trial and encouraged submission of a formal protocol under a US IND in order to provide more detailed commentary. On April 23, 2024, we announced positive topline data from the investigator sponsored Phase 1 Trial of intravitreal VCN-01 in pediatric patients with refractory retinoblastoma. Safety and clinical outcomes support the therapeutic potential of VCN-01 in retinoblastoma and emphasize VCN-01 s potential for use in diverse cancer. The Monitoring Committee determined that the trial results were positive, and therefore, the Company will receive an exclusive, worldwide license, and related patents from Sant Joan de D u-Barcelona Children s Hospital for the treatment of pediatric patients with advanced retinoblastoma. On July 30, 2024, we received notice from the FDA that we had been granted Rare Pediatric Drug Designation (RPDD) for VCN-01 for the treatment of retinoblastoma. Previously, the FDA granted orphan drug designation to VCN-01 for treatment of retinoblastoma. Phase 1 Trial of intravenous VCN-01 in Combination with Durvalumab in Subjects with Recurrent/ Metastatic SCCHN In February 2019, VCN entered into a Clinical Trial Agreement with Catalan Institute of Oncology (ICO) (Spain) to conduct an investigator sponsored Phase 1 clinical study to evaluate the safety, tolerability and RP2D of a single intravenous injection of VCN-01 combined with durvalumab in two administration regimens: VCN-01 concomitantly with durvalumab, or sequentially with durvalumab starting two weeks after VCN-01 administration (NCT03799744). The study is also designed to evaluate whether VCN-01 treatment can re-sensitize PD-(l)-1 refractory tumors to subsequent anti-PD-L1 therapy. Durvalumab is a human monoclonal antibody (mAb) of the immunoglobulin G (IgG) 1 kappa subclass that inhibits binding of PD-L1. It is marketed as IMFINZI by AstraZeneca/MedImmune, who supplied the product for its use in the clinical study. This Phase I trial is a multicenter, open label, dose escalation study in patients with histologically confirmed head and neck squamous cell carcinoma from specific sites: oral cavity, oropharynx, larynx or hypopharynx that is recurrent/metastatic (R/M) and not amenable to curative therapy by surgery or radiation. In addition, all patients should have undergone prior exposure to anti-PD-(L) 1 and progressed. Patients are entered at each dose level, according to a planned dose escalation schedule. The treatment is a single intravenous VCN-01 dose combined with concomitant intravenous durvalumab (MEDI4736) 1500 mg Q4W (Arm I) or durvalumab starting two weeks after VCN-01 administration sequential schedule Arm II). Patient recruitment into Arm I and Arm II was performed concurrently. Intravenous VCN-01 was administered to each patient only once during the trial at the VCN-01 dose level to which they were randomized. Durvalumab was administered Q4W until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, or another discontinuation criterion. Patient recruitment into the study was completed in February 2022 with a total of 18 patients enrolled. On September 05, 2022 we announced a presentation of initial data from this study in a poster at the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) Congress. The poster reported that treatment with VCN-01 had an acceptable safety profile when administered with durvalumab in the sequential schedule and the most common treatment-related adverse events were dose-dependent and reversible pyrexia, flu-like symptoms and increases in liver transaminases. Sustained blood levels of VCN-01 viral genomes and increased serum hyaluronidase levels were maintained for over six weeks and analysis of tumor samples showed an increase in CD8 T cells (a marker of tumor inflammation); upregulation of PD-L1; and downregulation of matrix-related pathways after VCN-01 administration. The last patients in this study are currently being followed for overall survival and patent samples are being analyzed to evaluate potential VCN-01 pharmacodynamic effects.

 On October 16, 2023, we presented additional data from this study in a poster at the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) 2023 Congress held virtually and in Madrid, Spain from October 20-24, 2023. Key data and conclusions featured in the ESMO presentation include: 20 patients were enrolled with a median of 4 prior lines of therapy, from which six in the concomitant (CS) (single dose of VCN-01 in combination with durvalumab on day 1) and 12 in the sequential (SS) (single dose of VCN-01 on day -14 and durvalumab on day 1) were evaluable for response. In the CS cohort at the 3.3 10 12 viral particles (vp) dose, overall survival (OS) was 10.4 months. In the SS cohort at the 3.3 10 12 vp dose OS was 15.5 months, whereas in the SS cohort at the 1 10 13 vp dose OS was 17.3 months. 11 patients (61.1 were alive >12 months (2 in CS; 5 in SS at 3.3 10 12 vp, 4 in SS at 1 10 13 vp). In spite of the advanced stage of the disease, and a global objective response rate for the trial of 5.5 , most of the patients appeared to benefit from subsequent treatment, with 2 patients showing complete responses to palliative chemotherapy and at least one patient still alive 4 years after entering the study. Biological activity: Patients showed VCN-01 replication and increased serum hyaluronidase levels were maintained for over six weeks. Observed an increase in CD8 T cells, a marker of tumor inflammation and an upregulation of PD-L1 in tumors. Increase of PDL1-CPS (16/21; p=0.013) and CD8 T-cells (12/21; p=0.007) from baseline were found in tumor biopsies. There was a statistically significant correlation between OS observed in patients and CPS on day 8 (p=0.005). Phase 1 Trial evaluating the safety and feasibility of huCART-meso cells when given in combination with VCN-01 In July 2021, VCN entered into a Clinical Trial Agreement with the University of Pennsylvania (Philadelphia) to conduct an investigator sponsored Phase 1 clinical study to evaluate the safety, tolerability and feasibility of intravenous administration of VCN-01 in combination with lentiviral transduced huCART-meso cells (developed by the laboratory of Dr. Carl June) in patients with histologically confirmed unresectable or metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma and serous epithelial ovarian cancer (NCT05057715). This is a Phase I study evaluating the combination of VCN-01 when given in combination with huCART-meso cells in a dose-escalation design in two cohorts (N = 3-6), where patients receive VCN-01 as a single IV infusion (at 3.3x10 12 or 1x10 13 vp) on Day 0, followed by a single dose of 5x10 7 huCART-meso cells on Day 14 via IV infusion. huCART-meso cells are modified T-cells targeting the mesothelin antigen, which is frequently expressed in multiple tumor types, particularly in pancreatic and ovarian cancers. Dr. June s previous clinical studies have shown that huCART-meso cells encounter significant challenges in the tumor microenvironment, including immunosuppressive cells and soluble factors as well as metabolic restrictions. Initial VCN-01 clinical data from the studies described above suggest that administration of VCN-01 may increase tumor immunogenicity and improve access of the huCART-meso cells to tumor cells. This Phase I study will evaluate the safety and tolerability of the VCN-01 huCART-meso cell combination and test the hypothesis that administration of VCN-01 may enhance the potential antitumor effects of the co-administered huCART-meso cells. On July 8, 2022, we were notified that the first patient to be dosed with VCN-01 had passed the safety evaluation period in this study. On June 22, 2023, at their Cellicon Valley conference, and again at the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC) meeting in San Diego, CA on November 03, 2023, and the International Oncolytic Virotherapy Conference (IOVC2023) in Calgary on November 13 2023, University of Pennsylvania investigators presented preliminary clinical safety and pharmacokinetic data from this study highlighting the feasibility of administering VCN-01 in sequence with huCART-meso cells in pancreatic and ovarian cancer patients. VCN-01 persistence was suggestive of tumor infection and active replication. The peak and duration of huCART-meso T cells in the peripheral blood as well as duration of stable disease in evaluable patients showed encouraging trends. The study is ongoing and may test higher doses of VCN-01 and interrogate tumor biopsies to gain further insights. The results will inform and guide optimization of the combination of CAR T cells with oncolytic virus.

 Phase 1 Trial evaluating the intravenous administration of VCN-01 in patients prior to surgical resection of high-grade brain tumors In the second quarter of 2021, VCN entered into a Clinical Trial Agreement with the University of Leeds (UK) to sponsor a proof-of-concept Phase 1 clinical study to evaluate whether intravenously administered VCN-01 can cross the blood-brain barrier and infect the target brain tumor. This is an open-label, non-randomized, single center study of VCN-01 given intravenously at a dose of 1x10 13 virus particles to patients prior to planned surgery for recurrent high-grade primary or metastatic brain tumors. We believe that the intravenous delivery of anti-cancer therapy to brain tumors, if effective, may enable the treatment of systemically disseminated brain metastases and may allow for reduction in the need to use neurosurgery to administer the drugs. This study aims to assess the presence of VCN-01 within the resected surgical specimen after systemic VCN-01 delivery and determine the safety of intravenous VCN-01 in patients with recurrent high-grade glioma or brain metastases. By confirming the presence of VCN-01 in high grade brain tumors following intravenous delivery, this study may pave the way for larger trials to study VCN-01 efficacy, both as a monotherapy and in combination with PD-1/PD-L1 blockade. This trial has already received approval from Medicines Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) from UK Government. On January 9, 2023, we issued a press release announcing that the first patient was dosed in this study and recruitment is on-going. Our Current Gastrointestinal (GI) and Microbiome-Focused Pipeline Our SYN-004 (ribaxamase) and SYN-020 clinical programs are focused on the gastrointestinal tract (GI) and the gut microbiome, which is home to billions of microbial species and composed of a natural balance of both good beneficial species and potentially bad pathogenic species. When the natural balance or normal function of these microbial species is disrupted, a person s health can be compromised. All of our programs are supported by our growing intellectual property portfolio. We are maintaining and building our patent portfolio through: prosecuting existing applications; and licensing and acquiring new patents and patent applications. We are exploring value creation options for our SYN-004 assets, including out-licensing or partnering. SYN-004 (ribaxamase) Prevention of antibiotic-mediated microbiome damage, thereby preventing overgrowth and infection by pathogenic organisms such as Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) and vancomycin resistant Enterococci (VRE), and reducing the incidence and severity of acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) in allogeneic HCT recipients SYN-004 (ribaxamase) is a proprietary oral capsule prophylactic therapy designed to degrade certain IV beta-lactam antibiotics excreted into the GI tract and thereby maintain the natural balance of the gut microbiome. Preventing beta-lactam damage to the gut microbiome has a range of potential therapeutic outcomes, including prevention of CDI, suppression of the overgrowth of pathogenic species (particularly antimicrobial-resistant organisms) and potentially reducing the incidence and/or severity of aGVHD in allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) patients. SYN-004 (ribaxamase) 75 mg capsules are intended to be administered orally while patients are administered certain IV beta-lactam antibiotics. The capsule dosage form is designed to release the SYN-004 (ribaxamase) enzyme into proximal small intestine, where it has been shown to degrade beta-lactam antibiotics in the GI tract without altering systemic antibiotic levels. Beta-lactam antibiotics are a mainstay in hospital infection management and include the commonly used penicillin and cephalosporin classes of antibiotics. Clostridioides difficile Infection Clostridioides difficile (formerly known as Clostridium difficile and often called C. difficile or CDI) is a leading type of hospital acquired infection and is frequently associated with IV beta-lactam antibiotic treatment. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) identified C. difficile as an urgent public health threat, particularly given its resistance to many drugs used to treat other infections. CDI is a major unintended risk associated with the prophylactic or therapeutic use of IV antibiotics, which may adversely alter the natural balance of microflora that normally protect the GI tract, leading to C. difficile overgrowth and infection. Other risk factors for CDI include hospitalization, prolonged length of stay (estimated at 7 days), underlying illness, and immune-compromising conditions including the administration of chemotherapy and advanced age. According to a paper published in BMC Infectious Diseases (Desai K et al. BMC Infect Dis. 2016; 16: 303) the economic cost of CDI was approximately 5.4 billion in 2016 4.7 billion in healthcare settings; 725 million in the community) in the U.S., mostly due to hospitalizations.

 Phase 1b/2a Clinical Study in Allogeneic HCT Recipients In August 2019, we entered into a Clinical Trial Agreement (CTA) with the Washington University School of Medicine (Washington University) to conduct a Phase 1b/2a clinical trial of SYN-004 (ribaxamase). Under the terms of this agreement, we serve as the sponsor of the study and supply SYN-004 (ribaxamase). Dr. Erik R. Dubberke, Professor of Medicine and Clinical Director, Transplant Infectious Diseases at Washington University and a member of the SYN-004 (ribaxamase) steering committee serves as the principal investigator of the clinical trial in collaboration with his Washington University colleague Dr. Mark A. Schroeder, Associate Professor of Medicine, Division of Oncology, Bone Marrow Transplantation and Leukemia. The Phase 1b/2a clinical trial is a single center, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trial of oral SYN-004 (ribaxamase) in up to 36 evaluable adult allogeneic HCT recipients. The goal of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability and potential absorption into the systemic circulation (if any) of oral SYN-004 (ribaxamase; 150 mg four times daily) administered to allogeneic HCT recipients who receive an IV carbapenem or beta-lactam antibiotic to treat fever. Study participants are enrolled into three sequential cohorts administered a different study-assigned IV antibiotic. Each cohort seeks to complete eight evaluable participants treated with SYN-004 (ribaxamase) and four evaluable participants treated with placebo. Safety and pharmacokinetic data for each cohort will be reviewed by an independent Data and Safety Monitoring Committee, which will make a recommendation on whether to proceed to the next IV antibiotic cohort. The study will also evaluate potential protective effects of SYN-004 on the gut microbiome as well as generate preliminary information on potential therapeutic benefits and patient outcomes of SYN-004 in allogeneic HCT recipients. To date, we have completed 2 of 3 cohorts (Cohorts 1 and 2) in this study. On September 27, 2022, we issued a press release announcing positive outcomes from the Data and Safety Monitoring Committee DSMC review of results from the first Cohort and their recommendation that the study may proceed to enroll Cohort 2 in which study drug (SYN-004 or Placebo) is administered in combination with the IV beta-lactam antibiotic piperacillin/tazobactam. On October 3, 2024, we announced a positive outcome from the Data and Safety Monitoring Committee DSMC review of results from the second Cohort of our Phase 1b/2a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trial of SYN-004 (ribaxamase) in allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant HCT recipients for the prevention of acute graft-versus-host-disease. Based on a review of the safety and pharmacokinetic data, the DSMC has recommended that the study may proceed to enroll Cohort 3 in which study drug (SYN-004 or Placebo) will be administered in combination with the IV beta-lactam antibiotic cefepime. Based upon our current available funding and our focus on our clinical development of VCN-01 we do not anticipate that enrollment for the third cohort will commence unless we obtain grant funding, or find a licensee or partner for the SYN-004 development program. On February 16, 2023 and April 13, 2023, we announced the presentation of safety and pharmacokinetic data from Cohort 1 of the Phase 1b/2a Clinical Trial of SYN-004 (ribaxamase) in allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant recipients at the 2023 Tandem Meetings: Transplantation Cellular Therapy Meetings of ASTCT and CIBMTR and at the European Congress of Clinical Microbiology Infectious Diseases (ECCMID), respectively. SYN-020 Oral Intestinal Alkaline Phosphatase (IAP) SYN-020 is a quality-controlled, recombinant version of bovine Intestinal Alkaline Phosphatase (IAP) produced under cGMP conditions and formulated for oral delivery. The published literature indicates that IAP functions to diminish GI and systemic inflammation, tighten the gut barrier to diminish leaky gut, diminish fat absorption, and promote a healthy microbiome. Despite its broad therapeutic potential, a key hurdle to commercialization has been the high cost of IAP manufacture which is commercially available for as much as 10,000 per gram. We believe we have developed technologies to traverse this hurdle and now have the ability to produce more than 3 grams per liter of SYN-020 and anticipate a cost of roughly a few hundred dollars per gram at commercial scale. Based on the known mechanisms as well as our own supporting animal model data, we intended to initially develop SYN-020 to mitigate the intestinal damage caused by radiation therapy that is routinely used to treat pelvic cancers. While we believe SYN-020 may play a pivotal role in addressing acute and long-term complications associated with radiation exposure to the GI tract, we have also begun planning for potential development of SYN-020 in large market indications with significant unmet medical needs. Such indications include celiac disease, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease NAFLD ), and indications to treat and prevent metabolic and inflammatory disorders associated with aging.

 On June 30, 2020, we submitted an IND application to the FDA in support of an initial indication for the treatment of radiation enteropathy secondary to pelvic cancer therapy. On July 30, 2020, we announced that we received a study-may-proceed letter from the FDA to conduct a Phase 1a single-ascending-dose SAD study in healthy volunteers designed to evaluate SYN-020 for safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetic parameters (NCT04815993). On June 29, 2021, we announced that enrollment, patient dosing and observation had been completed in the Phase 1, open-label, SAD study of SYN-020. The SAD study enrolled 6 healthy adult volunteers into each of four cohorts with SYN-020 given orally as single doses ranging from 5 mg to 150 mg. The data demonstrated that SYN-020 maintained a favorable safety profile, was well tolerated at all dose levels, and no adverse events were attributed to the study drug. No serious adverse events were reported. During the third quarter of 2021 we initiated a Phase 1 clinical study evaluating multiple ascending doses MAD of SYN-020 (NCT05045833). The placebo-controlled, blinded study enrolled 32 healthy adult volunteers into four cohorts with SYN-020 administered orally in doses ranging from 5 mg to 75 mg twice daily for 14 days with a follow-up evaluation at day 35. Each cohort included six subjects who received SYN-020 and two who received placebo. On May 10, 2022, we announced positive safety data from the Phase 1 MAD study demonstrating that SYN-020 maintained a favorable safety profile and was well-tolerated across all dose levels. There were a few treatment-related adverse events, and all were mild (grade 1) and resolved without medical intervention. The most common adverse event, constipation, occurred in three out of 24 subjects in the treatment arm and in one out of eight subjects in the placebo arm. No adverse event led to discontinuation of the study drug and there were no serious adverse events. Additionally, fecal SYN-020 analyses verified intestinal bioavailability while plasma levels of SYN-020 were below the limit of quantitation in all samples at all timepoints verifying that SYN-020 was not absorbed into the systemic circulation. During the second quarter of 2020, we announced that we entered into an agreement with Massachusetts General Hospital MGH granting us an option for an exclusive license to intellectual property and technology related to the use of IAP to maintain GI and microbiome health, diminish systemic inflammation, and treat age-related diseases, which option was later amended liver fibrosis in select diseases, including NAFLD. The option expired unexercised on July 1, 2024. The Phase 1 data from our SAD and MAD studies are intended to support the development of SYN-020 in multiple clinical indications including radiation enteritis, NAFLD, celiac disease, and diseases associated with aging. With our transition to an oncology focused Company, we are exploring strategic opportunities to enable advancement of this potentially valuable asset. Research Programs VCN-01 + Topoisomerase Inhibitors On May 10, 2024, we presented non-clinical describing enhanced anti-tumor effects in human pancreatic cancer xenograft-bearing mice treated with lead product candidate VCN-01 and liposomal irinotecan in a poster at the 27 th American Society of Gene and Cell Therapy (ASGCT) 2024 Congress held in Baltimore (Maryland) from May 7-11, 2024. These data support the potential synergy of VCN-01 and additional first-line pancreatic cancer chemotherapy regimens FOLFIRINOX and NALIRIFOX. Key finding reported in the poster include: The combination of VCN-01 + topoisomerase I (topo1) inhibitors, such as liposomal irinotecan, has a tolerable toxicity profile and may improve efficacy in the treatment of human pancreatic cancer. Viral protein expression was increased in human pancreatic cancer cell lines when they were exposed to topo1 inhibiting chemotherapeutics, irinotecan, its active metabolite, SN-38, and topotecan. Synergy of VCN-01 plus liposomal irinotecan was observed in animals bearing subcutaneous human pancreatic tumors. 
 o In human pancreatic mouse xenograft models, treatment with VCN-01 at a dose of 4x1010 vp or liposomal irinotecan alone (at both the 10 mg/kg and 5 mg/kg doses) resulted in significant tumor growth inhibition compared to saline. o Combination therapy with VCN-01 + liposomal irinotecan at either dose displayed significantly reduced tumor growth compared to each treatment alone. o qPCR analyses performed on tumors collected at end of study confirmed the presence of viral genomes, indicating ongoing transcriptional activity of VCN-01, which is consistent with viral replication for several days after administration.

 VCN-X Next Generation OVs and Albumin Shield Technology In parallel with VCN-01 clinical development, we are developing next-generation oncolytic adenoviruses (termed VCN-X) with novel therapeutic payloads and structural modifications to increase tumor cell killing and improve systemic virus pharmacokinetics. Preclinical proof-of-concept has been established with VCN-11, which has been engineered to contain all of the features of VCN-01 as well as an additional modification to include an albumin binding domain (ABD) in the virus capsid. The virus capsid is the target for neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) that are generated by the host immune system to destroy circulating viruses. The presence of an ABD, however, blocks the binding of most neutralizing antibodies, which allows the virus to reach the tumor following intravenous administration. This Albumin Shield works because human blood contains a large amount of albumin to coat the ABD-containing virus. Importantly, this coating of albumin appears to be displaced after the virus reaches tumor cells to infect them. In pre-clinical mouse studies to test the functionality of the Albumin Shield , mice pre-immunized with virus are able to completely neutralize an unmodified OV because they have a large concentration of neutralizing antibodies in their blood. By contrast, viruses such as VCN-11 that contain the ABD are not neutralized and retain their ability to infect and destroy tumor cells. We believe the results with VCN-11 support the application of the Albumin Shield technology in our VCN-X program to advance treatments for tumors in which rapid multi-dosing may be beneficial. In March 2021, preclinical data obtained with VCN-11 was published (J Control Release. 2021 Apr 10;332:517-528), showing that the ABD-containing virus induced 450 times more cytotoxicity in tumor cells than in normal cells. Hyaluronidase production was confirmed by measuring the activity of the PH20 enzyme with a hyaluronic acid-degradation assay, and by measuring PH20 activity in VCN-11 infected tumors in vivo. The ABD-containing virus evaded NAbs from different sources and tumor levels of virus were demonstrated in the presence of high levels of NAbs in vivo, whereas the control virus without ABD was neutralized. VCN-11 showed a low toxicity profile in athymic nude mice and Syrian hamsters, allowing treatments with high doses and fractionated administrations without major toxicities (up to 1.2x10 11 vp/mouse and 7.5x10 11 vp/hamster). ALT levels were increased on day 3 within an acceptable range that returned to normal levels by day 9. Fractionated intravenous administration of the ABD-containing virus (splitting the dose into two portions administered 4 h apart) appeared to improve virus circulation kinetics and increase tumor levels. Antitumor efficacy was observed in the presence of NAbs against Ad5 and the ABD-containing virus. In May 2022, we presented data at the 25th Annual Meeting of the American Society of Gene Cell Therapy (ASGCT). The presentation included preclinical results showcasing the potential of the Albumin Shield Technology to effectively target tumors after intravenous re-administration, even in the presence of high level NAbs, with no major toxicities observed. Our internal VCN-X discovery programs are currently evaluating new oncolytic viruses that contain the Albumin Shield technology and may expand the potential efficacy of Theriva s oncolytic viruses. Intellectual Property All of our programs are supported by growing patent estates. In total, Theriva Biologics has over 175 U.S. and foreign patents and over 60 U.S. and foreign patents pending. VCN, through assignment or exclusive licenses, controls over 50 U.S. and foreign patents and over 15 U.S. and foreign patents pending. The SYN-004 (ribaxamase) program is supported by intellectual property IP that is assigned to Theriva Biologics, namely U.S. and foreign patents (in most major markets, e.g. Europe (including Germany, Great Britain and France), Japan, China and Canada, among others) and U.S. and foreign patents pending (in most major markets, e.g. Europe (including Germany, Great Britain and France), Japan, China and Canada, among others). For instance, U.S. Patent Nos. 8,894,994 and 9,587,234, which include claims to compositions of matter and pharmaceutical compositions of beta-lactamases, including SYN-004 (ribaxamase), have patent terms to at least 2031. Further, U.S. Patent 9,301,995 and 9,301,996, both of which will expire in at least 2031, cover various uses of beta-lactamases, including SYN-004 (ribaxamase), in protecting the microbiome, and U.S. Patent Nos. 9,290,754, 9,376,673, 9,404,103, 9,464,280, and 9,695,409 which will expire in at least 2035, covers further beta-lactamase compositions of matter related to SYN-004 (ribaxamase). The SYN-020 (oral intestinal alkaline phosphatase (IAP)) program is supported by IP that is assigned to Theriva Biologics, namely U.S. and foreign patents and patent applications (in many major markets, e.g. Europe, China, Japan, Korea, Canada, and Australia). These patents and patent applications, which cover various formulations, medical uses and manufacture of SYN-020, are expected to expire in 2038-2040, without taking potential patent term extensions or patent term adjustment into account.

 The VCN-01 and Albumin Shield programs are supported by U.S. and foreign patents and patent applications that are assigned to VCN or exclusively licensed from Fundaci Privada Institut d Investigacio Biomedica de Bellvitge (IDIBELL), Institut Catala d Oncologia (ICO), and Hospital Sant Joan de D u in Barcelona. The patents and patent applications include U.S. patents and foreign patents (in most major markets, e.g. Europe, China, Japan, Korea, Canada, Israel, Mexico, Russia, and Australia) and U.S. and foreign patents pending (in most major markets, e.g. Europe, China, Korea, Canada, Mexico, and India). The patents and patent applications cover compositions of matter and pharmaceutical compositions of oncolytic adenoviruses and various medical uses of the same. For instance, U.S. Patent No. 10,316,065, which expires in 2030 without taking potential patent term extensions or patent term adjustment into account, provides composition of matter and pharmaceutical composition coverage for a genus of engineered oncolytic adenovirus suitable for the treatment of solid tumors. Other patents and patent applications, if granted, will provide protection to 2037 without taking potential patent term extensions or patent term adjustment into account. Our goal is to (i) obtain, maintain, and enforce patent protection for our products, formulations, processes, methods, and other proprietary technologies, (ii) preserve our trade secrets, and (iii) operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of other parties worldwide. We seek, where appropriate, the broadest intellectual property protection for product candidates, proprietary information, and proprietary technology through a combination of contractual arrangements and patents. Critical Accounting Estimates The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP) which requires the use of estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed consolidated financial statements, and the reported amounts of expenses in the periods presented. We believe that the accounting estimates employed are appropriate and resulting balances are reasonable; however, due to inherent uncertainties in making estimates, actual results may differ from the original estimates, requiring adjustments to these balances in future periods. There are accounting policies, each of which requires significant judgments and estimates on the part of management, that we believe are significant to the presentation of our consolidated financial statements. The most significant accounting estimates relate to goodwill and IPR D, research and development costs, contingent consideration, and impairment of long-lived assets. Goodwill and IPR D We classify intangible assets into two categories: (1) intangible assets with indefinite lives not subject to amortization and (2) goodwill. Intangible assets that are deemed to have indefinite lives, including goodwill, are reviewed for impairment annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. The impairment test for indefinite-lived intangibles, other than goodwill, consists of a comparison of the fair value of the intangible asset with their carrying amount. If the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, an impairment charge is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. Indefinite-lived intangible assets, such as goodwill, are not amortized. We test the carrying amounts of goodwill for recoverability on an annual basis or when events or changes in circumstances indicate evidence a potential impairment exists, using a fair value-based test. If a reporting unit s carrying value exceeds its fair value, then we will record a goodwill impairment charge for the excess amount. IPR D assets are considered to be indefinite-lived until the completion or abandonment of the associated research and development projects. IPR D assets represent the fair value assigned to technologies that we acquire, which at the time of acquisition have not reached technological feasibility and have no alternative future use. During the period that the assets are considered indefinite-lived, they are tested for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if we become aware of any events occurring or changes in circumstances that indicate that the fair value of the IPR D assets are less than their carrying amounts. If and when development is complete, which generally occurs upon regulatory approval and the ability to commercialize products associated with the IPR D assets, these assets are then deemed definite-lived and are amortized based on their estimated useful lives at that point in time. If development is terminated or abandoned, we may have a full or partial impairment charge related to the IPR D assets, calculated as the excess of carrying value of the IPR D assets over fair value. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price paid when we acquired VCN in March 2022, over the fair values of the acquired tangible or intangible assets and assumed liabilities. We conduct an impairment test of goodwill on an annual basis as of October 1 of each year and will also conduct tests if events occur or circumstances change that would, more likely than not, reduce our fair value below our net equity value.

 Contingent Consideration Consideration paid in a business combination may include potential future payments that are contingent upon the acquired business achieving certain milestones in the future contingent consideration ). Contingent consideration liabilities are measured at their estimated fair value as of the date of acquisition, with subsequent changes in fair value recorded in the consolidated statements of operations. We estimate the fair value of the contingent consideration as of the acquisition date using the estimated future cash outflows based on the probability of meeting future milestones. The milestone payments will be made upon the achievement of clinical and commercialization milestones. Subsequent to the date of acquisition, we reassess the actual consideration earned and the probability-weighted future earn-out payments at each balance sheet date. Any adjustment to the contingent consideration liability will be recorded in the consolidated statements of operations. Contingent consideration liabilities expected to be settled within 12 months after the balance sheet date are presented in current liabilities, with the non-current portion recorded under long term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. Research and Development Costs We expense research and development costs associated with developmental products not yet approved by the FDA to research and development expense as incurred. Research and development costs consist primarily of license fees (including upfront payments), milestone payments, manufacturing costs, salaries, stock-based compensation and related employee costs, fees paid to consultants and outside service providers for laboratory development, legal expenses resulting from intellectual property prosecution and other expenses relating to the design, development, testing and enhancement of our product candidates. Research and development expenses include external contract research organization CRO services. Additionally, the grant income is used to offset research and development costs. We make payments to the CROs based on agreed upon terms and may include payments in advance of study services. We review and accrue CRO expenses based on services performed and rely on estimates of those costs applicable to the stage of completion of study as provided by the CRO. Accrued CRO costs are subject to revisions as such studies progress to completion. At September 30, 2024 and 2023, we have accrued CRO expenses of 2.4 million and 1.4 million, respectively, that are included in accrued expenses. As of September 30, 2024 and 2023, we have prepaid CRO costs of 0.4 million and 1.2 million, respectively, that are included in prepaid expenses. Results of Operations Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 General and Administrative Expenses General and administrative expenses increased to 2.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 212,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. This increase of 986 is primarily related to a 1.5 million decrease in contingent consideration during the three months ended September 30, 2023, resulting in a reduction of prior period expenses and a 0.5 million increase in contingent consideration during the three months ended September 30, 2024. Additionally, there was a decrease in investor relations expenses, Theriva S.L. expenses, and lower director and officer insurance, offset by increased audit and registration fees. The charge related to stock-based compensation expense was 118,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 95,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Research and Development Expenses Research and development expenses decreased to 2.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from approximately 4.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease of 32 is primarily the result of lower clinical trial expenses related to our VIRAGE Phase 2 clinical trial of VCN-01 in PDAC, lower expenses related to our Phase 1a clinical trial of SYN-020 which has completed, and lower expenses to our Phase 1b/2a clinical trial of SYN-004 (ribaxamase) in allogeneic HCT recipients. We anticipate research and development expense to increase as we continue our VIRAGE Phase 2 clinical trial of VCN-01 and plan for our Phase 3 clinical trial of VCN-01 in PDAC, advance our VCN-01 program in retinoblastoma, expand GMP manufacturing activities for VCN-01, and continue supporting our other preclinical and discovery initiatives. The charge related to stock-based compensation expense was 59,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 40,000 related to stock-based compensation expense for the three months ended September 30, 2023.

 The following table sets forth our research and development expenses directly related to our product candidates for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. These direct expenses were external costs associated with preclinical studies and clinical trials. Indirect research and development expenses related to employee costs, facilities, stock-based compensation and research and development support services that are not directly allocated to specific product candidates.

We performed an interim impairment analysis using the Income approach that requires significant judgments, including primarily the estimation of future development costs, the probability of success in various phases of our development programs, potential post-launch cash flows and a risk-adjusted weighted average cost of capital. We concluded that the in-process R D with a carrying value of 19.8 million was written down to its estimated fair value of 18.6 million and an impairment charge of 1.3 million was recorded, and goodwill with a carrying value of 1.5 million was written down to its estimated fair value of zero and an impairment charge of 1.5 million was recorded during the quarter. The decrease in the valuation was primarily driven by an increase in the discount rate which was impacted by an increase in the company specific risk premium, and not by material changes to the clinical and administrative operations of the business. Other Income/Expense Other income was 161,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to other income of 388,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Other income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 is primarily comprised of interest income of 158,000 and an exchange gain of 3,000. Other income for the three months ended September 30, 2023 is primarily comprised of interest income of 382,000 and an exchange gain of 6,000. Net Loss Attributable to Common Stockholders Our net loss attributable to common stockholders was approximately 7.7 million, or 6.81 per basic and diluted common share, for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to a net loss of approximately 3.3 million, or 4.85 per basic and diluted common share, for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 General and Administrative Expenses General and administrative expenses increased to 5.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 5.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This increase of 12 is primarily comprised of the contingent consideration adjustment of 1.5 million and registration fees, offset by a decrease in compensation costs, consulting, legal fees, audit fees and lower director and officer insurance. The charge related to stock-based compensation expense was 335,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 288,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

 Research and Development Expenses Research and development expenses decreased to 9.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from approximately 10.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease of 10 is primarily the result of lower clinical trial expenses related to our VIRAGE Phase 2 clinical trial of VCN-01 in PDAC, lower expenses related to our Phase 1a clinical trial of SYN-020, offset by increased expenses related to the Phase 1 trial of intravitreal VCN-01 in patients with retinoblastoma, and increased expenses related to our Phase 1b/2a clinical trial of SYN-004 (ribaxamase) in allogeneic HCT recipients. We anticipate research and development expense to increase as we continue our VIRAGE Phase 2 clinical trial of VCN-01and plan for our Phase 3 clinical trial of VCN-01 in PDAC, advance our VCN-01 program in retinoblastoma, expand GMP manufacturing activities for VCN-01, and continue supporting our other preclinical and discovery initiatives.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources As of September 30, 2024, we have a significant accumulated deficit, and with the exception of the three months ended June 30, 2010 and the three months ended December 31, 2017, the Company has experienced significant losses and incurred negative cash flows since inception. We have incurred an accumulated deficit of 330.5 million as of September 30, 2024, and expect to continue to incur losses in the foreseeable future with the recognition of revenue being contingent on successful phase 3 clinical trials and requisite approvals by the FDA or foreign equivalents. Our cash and cash equivalents totaled 16.4 million as of September 30, 2024, a decrease of 6.8 million from December 31, 2023. During the year ended December 31, 2023 and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the primary use of cash was for working capital requirements and operating activities which resulted in a net loss of 18.3 million and 21.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 and the nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. With our cash position of approximately 14.1 million in early November 2024, we believe we will be able to fund our operations into the third quarter of 2025. Following the anticipated completion of our ongoing Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials for VCN-01, and preclinical studies supporting VCN-01 and our discovery initiatives, we will need to obtain additional funds for future clinical trials. We anticipate that our future clinical trials will be much larger in size and require larger cash expenditures than the aforementioned clinical programs. We do not have any committed sources of financing for future clinical trials at this time, and it is uncertain whether additional funding will be available when we need it on terms that will be acceptable to us, or at all. Management believes its plan, which is focused on the advancement of VCN-01 will allow us to meet our financial obligations, further advance key products, and maintain our planned operations. Based on our current plans, our cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to complete our planned clinical trials of VCN-01 (in PDAC and retinoblastoma), but may not be sufficient for additional trials of VCN-01, SYN-020 or SYN-004, or to complete the last cohort of the Phase 1a/2a clinical trial of SYN-004, which are expected to require significant cash expenditures. Based upon our current available funding and our focus on our clinical development of VCN-01 we do not anticipate that enrollment for the third cohort will commence unless we obtain grant funding, or find a licensee or partner for the SYN-004 development program. However, the amount of additional capital needed by us will also depend upon the costs to advance our VCN-01 clinical programs and whether we continue to develop SYN-004 internally, or out-license or partner such development. If necessary, we may attempt to utilize the at the market sales facility (the ATM or seek to raise additional capital in other financing transactions, neither of which is guaranteed. Use of the ATM is limited by certain restrictions and management s plan does not rely on additional capital from either of these sources. If we are not able to obtain additional capital (which is not assured at this time), our long-term business plan may not be accomplished, and we may be forced to cease certain development activities. More specifically, the completion of any later stage clinical trial will require significant financing or a significant partnership. Historically, we have financed our operations primarily through public and private sales of our securities, and we expect to continue to seek and obtain additional capital in a similar manner. During the year ended December 31, 2023, our only source of cash was from sales of our Common Stock through the ATM pursuant to which we sold 81,000 shares of our Common Stock for net proceeds of 2.2 million. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our only source of cash was from sales of our Common Stock through the Amended and Restated ATM Sales Agreement pursuant to which we sold 569,000 shares of our Common Stock for net proceeds of 3.6 million and from the sale of our securities in our public offering of 918,600 shares of Common Stock in combination with accompanying warrants to purchase an aggregate of 1,428,600 shares of the Common Stock for gross proceeds of 2.5 million (net proceeds of 2.0 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and estimated expenses). There can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to raise funds through the sale of shares of Common Stock through the ATM or other equity financings. If we raise funds by selling additional shares of Common Stock or other securities convertible into Common Stock, the ownership interest of our existing stockholders will be diluted. If we are not able to obtain funding for future clinical trials when needed, we will be unable to carry out our business plan and we will be forced to delay the initiation of future clinical trials until such time as we obtain adequate financing and may need to abandon some of our development programs.

 We have spent, and expect to continue to spend, a substantial amount of funds in connection with implementing our business strategy, including our planned product development efforts, preparation for our planned clinical trials, performance of clinical trials and our research and discovery efforts. Based on our current plans, our cash and cash equivalents will not be sufficient to enable us to meet our near term or long-term expected plans as it is anticipated that we will not have enough cash to continue our operations for the next twelve months from the date of the filing of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. We will be required to obtain additional funding in order to continue the development of certain product candidates within the anticipated time periods (including initiation of planned clinical trials), if at all, and to continue to fund operations at the current cash expenditure levels. We do anticipate that our current cash of approximately 14.1 million as of early November 2024 will allow us to cover overhead costs, manufacturing costs for near-term clinical supply, manufacturing costs of VCN-01 for clinical trail use and limited research efforts, including completing our funding requirements for our ongoing Phase 1b/2a clinical study (cohort II) of SYN-004 (ribaxamase) in allogeneic HCT recipients for the prevention of aGVHD, our ongoing Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials for VCN-01, preclinical studies supporting VCN-01 and our ongoing discovery initiatives, and to fund our committed obligations under the terms of the VCN Share Purchase Agreement (the VCN Purchase Agreement related to the VCN Acquisition into the third quarter of 2025. Our independent registered public accounting firm has issued a report for the year ended December 31, 2023 that includes an explanatory paragraph referring to our recurring losses from operations (anticipated continued losses in the future) and net capital deficiency that raise substantial doubt in our ability to continue as a going concern without additional capital becoming available. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to obtain additional equity or debt financing, attain further operating efficiencies, reduce expenditures, and, ultimately, to generate revenue. Our notes to the consolidated financial statements contain an explanatory paragraph referring to our recurring and continuing losses from operations and expressing substantial doubt in our ability to continue as a going concern without additional capital becoming available. We cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to obtain the required funding to achieve our current business plan, obtain the required regulatory approvals for our product candidates or complete additional corporate partnering or acquisition transactions in order to commercialize such product candidates once regulatory approval is received. If we fail to obtain additional funding for our clinical trials, whether through the sale of securities or a partner or collaborator, and otherwise when needed, we will not be able to execute our business plan as planned and will be forced to cease certain development activities (including initiation of planned clinical trials) until funding is received and our business will suffer, which would have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to raise additional capital. Our cash and cash equivalents will not be sufficient to enable us to meet our near term or long-term expected plans, including initiation or completion of future registrational studies for VCN-01, any potential future trials of SYN-004 including Phase 3 clinical programs of SYN-004 (ribaxamase) for prevention of CDI or the Phase 1b/2a clinical study of SYN-004 (ribaxamase) in allogeneic HCT recipients, or later-stage clinical trials of SYN-020. Therefore, we do not intend to commence future new studies of VCN-01, SYN-004 (ribaxamase) or SYN-020 until we are confident that we have funding necessary to complete such trials. We are actively pursuing additional equity or debt financing, in the form of either a private placement or a public offering and have been in ongoing discussions with strategic institutional investors and investment banks with respect to such possible offerings. However, we do not currently have commitments from any third parties to provide us with capital. Potential sources of financing that we are pursuing include strategic relationships, public or private sales of our equity (including through the ATM) or debt and other sources. Such additional financing opportunities might not be available to us when and if needed, on acceptable terms or at all. We cannot assure that we will meet the requirements for use of the ATM especially in light of the fact that we are currently limited by rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC as to the number of shares of Common Stock that we can sell pursuant to the ATM due to the market value of our Common Stock held by non-affiliates. Even if we meet the requirements for use of the ATM, there can be no assurance that we will be able to raise funds through the sale of shares of Common Stock through the ATM. Additionally, we may seek to access the public or private equity markets when conditions are favorable due to our long-term capital requirements. If we are unable to obtain additional capital (which is not assured at this time), our long-term business plan may not be accomplished and we may be forced to cease certain development activities. More specifically, the completion of future Phase 3 and/or registrational clinical studies will require significant financing or a significant partnership. If we raise funds by selling additional shares of Common Stock or other securities convertible into Common Stock, the ownership interest of our existing stockholders will be diluted. If we are not able to obtain funding for future clinical trials when needed, we will be unable to carry out our business plan and we will be forced to delay the initiation of future clinical trials until such time as we obtain adequate financing and our operating results and prospects will be adversely affected.

 Cash Flows Cash Used in Operating Activities Net cash used in operating activities was 12.2 million and 12.5 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, which was primarily due to the use of funds in our operations related to the development of VCN-01 our product candidate. Cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased compared to the same period in 2023 due primarily to the decrease in net loss in 2024. Cash Used In Investing Activities Cash used in investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 1,000 and 146,000 for equipment purchases. Cash Provided by Financing Activities Cash provided by financing activities was 5.5 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2.1 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023.Cash provided by financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 included at the market offering proceeds of 3.6 million from sales of 569,000 shares of our Common Stock offset by payments related to loans extended by certain Spanish institutions of 67,000 and net proceeds of 2.0 million from the sale of our securities in our public offering of 918,600 shares of Common Stock in combination with accompanying warrants to purchase an aggregate of 1,428,600 shares. Cash provided by financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 included at the market offering proceeds of 2.2 million from sales of 81,000 shares of our Common Stock which was offset by 75,000 of debt payments. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we did not have, and we do not currently have, any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined under SEC rules. Contractual Obligations Leases At the inception of a contract we determine if the arrangement is, or contains, a lease. Right of use ROU assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at the commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. We have made certain accounting policy elections whereby we (i) do not recognize ROU assets or lease liabilities for short-term leases (those with original terms of 12-months or less) and (ii) combine lease and non-lease elements of our operating leases. As of September 30, 2024, we did not have any material finance leases.

 ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve our capital to fund operations. We also seek to maximize income from our investments without assuming significant risk. Our exposure to market risk is confined to our cash and cash equivalents. As of September 30, 2024 our cash and cash equivalents consisted primarily of investments in treasury securities. We do not engage in any hedging activities against changes in interest rates. Due to the short-term duration of our investment portfolio and the low risk profile of our investments, we would not expect our operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by the effect of a sudden change in market interest rates or credit conditions on our securities portfolio. We may, however, require additional financing to fund future obligations and no assurance can be given that the terms of future sources of financing will not expose us to material market risk. ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. (a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer who also serves as our Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. The term disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. We have adopted and maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as defined Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in the reports filed under the Exchange Act, such as this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, is collected, recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules of the SEC. The Company s disclosure controls and procedures are also designed to ensure that such information is accumulated and communicated to management to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Due to the material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting as described below, our Chief Executive Officer who also serves as our Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective. Based on its assessment, management has concluded that the Company did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2024, due to the following previously reported material weaknesses that continued to exist: Management did not design and maintain effective review controls at a sufficient level of precision with certain financial statement areas and over unusual transactions involving complex accounting and related disclosure requirements. Management did not maintain effective information technology general controls over user access, program change management, and segregation of duties, within certain key information systems supporting the Company s accounting and financial reporting processes. Additionally, many of the Company s business process controls dependent upon the information derived from these information systems were also ineffective, as management did not design and implement controls to validate the completeness and accuracy of underlying data utilized in the operation of those controls.

 Management s Plan for Remediation In response to the material weaknesses, management, with oversight of the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, has identified and begun to implement steps to remediate the material weaknesses. We have hired a third party consultant during 2024 to assist with the remediation efforts. While we have made progress during 2024, the remediation efforts are ongoing, as additional time is needed to complete the remediation and allow for the internal controls to be tested by management. Our continued internal control remediation efforts include the following: Enhancing existing policies and procedures to facilitate more efficient operations and improve the timely execution of key controls by company personnel. Enhancing program change management, user access provisioning, and monitoring controls to ensure changes to key applications are appropriately reviewed and approved and to enforce appropriate system access and segregation of duties. Improving the design of key controls to ensure reports used in the performance of such controls are complete and accurate as part of the controls execution. 
 We are committed to ensuring that our internal controls over financial reporting are designed and operating effectively. Management believes the efforts taken to date and the planned remediation will improve the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. While these remediation efforts are ongoing, the controls must be operating effectively for a sufficient period of time and be tested by management in order to consider them remediated and conclude that the design is effective to address the risks of material misstatement. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Except for the material weaknesses described above, there has been no change in the Company s internal control over financial reporting during the Company s most recent quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

 PART II OTHER INFORMATION ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS. From time to time we may become involved in legal proceedings or be subject to claims arising in the ordinary course of our business. We are not presently a party to any legal proceedings that, if determined adversely to us, would individually or taken together have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition or cash flows. Regardless of the outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on us because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources and other factors. ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS. The following information updates, and should be read in conjunction with, the information disclosed in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors, contained in our 2023 Form 10-K. Except as disclosed below, there have been no material changes from the risk factors disclosed in our 2023 Form 10-K. RISKS RELATING TO OUR BUSINESS There is uncertainty regarding our ability to maintain liquidity sufficient to operate our business effectively, which raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our consolidated unaudited financial statements as of September 30, 2024 have been prepared under the assumption that we will continue as a going concern for the next twelve months. Our management concluded that our recurring losses from operations and the fact that as of September 30, 2024 we have an accumulated deficit of approximately 330.5 and working capital of 12.2 million raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern for the next twelve months after issuance of our financial statements. As of September 30, 2024, we had a cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash balance of approximately 16.5 million. At December 31, 2023, we had an accumulated deficit of 309.3 million and working capital of 20.7 million. As of December 31, 2023, we had a cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash balance of approximately 23.3 million consisting of cash and investments in highly liquid U.S. money market funds. We expect to continue to incur losses from expenses related to the development of our product candidates and related administrative activities for the foreseeable future. We expect that our current cash will be able to fund operations into the third quarter of 2025 but will not be sufficient to fund operations for twelve months from the date of the filing of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and we will need to seek additional capital to fulfill our operating and capital requirement for the next 12 months to advance our clinical development program to later stages of development and commercialize our clinical product candidate. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to obtain additional equity or debt financing, attain further operating efficiencies, reduce expenditures, and, ultimately, to generate revenue. Although management has been successful in raising capital in the past, there can be no assurance that we will be successful or that any needed financing will be available in the future at terms acceptable to us. As such, we cannot conclude that such plans will be effectively implemented within one year after the date that the financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are filed with the SEC and there is uncertainty regarding our ability to maintain liquidity sufficient to operate our business effectively, which raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.

 We will need to raise additional capital to operate our business and our failure to obtain funding when needed may force us to delay, reduce or eliminate certain of our development programs or commercialization efforts. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our operating activities used net cash of approximately 12.2 million and our cash and cash equivalents were approximately 16.4 million as of September 30, 2024. With the exception of the three months ended June 30, 2010 and the three months ended December 31, 2017, we have experienced significant losses since inception and have a significant accumulated deficit. As of September 30, 2024, our accumulated deficit totaled approximately 330.5 million on a consolidated basis. Pursuant to the VCN Purchase Agreement, we have agreed to use reasonable efforts to commercialize VCN-01 and we agreed as a post- closing covenant to commit to fund VCN s research and development programs, including but not limited to VCN-01 PDAC phase 2 clinical trial, VCN-01 RB trial and necessary G A within a budgetary plan of approximately 27.8 million over three years. We expect to incur additional operating losses in the future and therefore expect our cumulative losses to increase. With the exception of the quarter ended June 30, 2010, and limited laboratory revenues from Adeona Clinical Laboratory, which we sold in March 2012, we have generated very minimal revenues. We do not expect to derive revenue from any source in the near future until we or our potential partners successfully commercialize our products. We expect our expenses to increase in connection with our anticipated activities, particularly as we continue research and development, initiate and conduct clinical trials, and seek marketing approval for our product candidates. Until such time as we receive approval from the FDA and other regulatory authorities for our product candidates, we will not be permitted to sell our products and therefore will not have product revenues from the sale of products. For the foreseeable future we will have to fund all of our operations and capital expenditures from equity and debt offerings, cash on hand, licensing and collaboration fees and grants, if any. We will need to raise additional capital to fund our operations and meet our current timelines and we cannot be certain that funding will be available on acceptable terms on a timely basis, or at all. Based on our current plans, our cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to complete our planned clinical trials of VCN-01 (in PDAC and retinoblastoma), but may not be sufficient for additional trials of VCN-01, SYN-020 or SYN-004, or to complete the last cohort of the Phase 1a/2a clinical trial of SYN-004, which are expected to require significant cash expenditures. In addition, based on the significant anticipated cost of a Phase 3 clinical program in a broad indication for SYN-004, we expect it will not be feasible for us to initiate and complete this trial at this time without a partner given the capital constraints tied to our current market cap and share price. We intend to focus our capital on our VCN-01 clinical trials and do not intend to provide further funding for our development of VCN-004 internally but intend to our license or partner further development ofSYN-004. Further development of VCN s product candidates will require additional funding. To the extent that we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities, our stockholders may experience significant dilution. Any debt financing, if available, may involve restrictive covenants that may impact our ability to conduct our business and also have a dilutive effect on our stockholders. A failure otherwise to secure additional funds when needed in the future whether through an equity or debt financing or a sufficient amount of capital without a strategic partnership could result in us being unable to complete planned preclinical and clinical trials or obtain approval of our product candidates from the FDA and other regulatory authorities. In addition, we could be forced to delay, discontinue or curtail product development, forego sales and marketing efforts, and forego licensing in attractive business opportunities. Our ability to raise capital through the sale of securities may be limited by the rules of the SEC and NYSE American that place limits on the number and dollar amount of securities that may be sold. There can be no assurances that we will be able to raise the funds needed, especially in light of the fact that our ability to sell securities registered on our registration statement on Form S-3 will be limited until such time the market value of our voting securities held by non-affiliates is 75 million or more. We also may be required to seek collaborators for our product candidates at an earlier stage than otherwise would be desirable and on terms that are less favorable than might otherwise be available. We expect to seek to raise additional capital in the future, which may be dilutive to stockholders or impose operational restrictions. We expect to seek to raise additional capital in the future to help fund development of our proposed products. If we raise additional capital through the issuance of equity or of debt securities, the percentage ownership of our current stockholders will be reduced. We may also enter into strategic transactions, issue equity as consideration for acquisitions or part of license issue fees to our licensors, compensate consultants or settle outstanding payables using equity that may be dilutive. We are authorized to issue 350,000,000 shares of Common Stock, of which 2,782,449 shares of Common Stock were outstanding as of November 8, 2024. If all of the unissued authorized shares were issued stockholders ownership percentage will be diluted. In order to raise additional capital, we may in the future offer additional shares of our Common Stock or other securities convertible into or exchangeable for our Common Stock at prices that may not be the same as the price per share paid by existing stockholders, thereby subjecting such stockholders to dilution. Our stockholders may experience additional dilution in net book value per share and any additional equity securities may have rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of the holders of our Common Stock. 

 49 

Table of Contents 
 We may sell shares or other securities in any other offering at a price per share that is less than the price per share paid by existing stockholders, and investors purchasing shares or other securities in the future could have rights superior to existing stockholders. The price per share at which we sell additional shares of our Common Stock, or securities convertible or exchangeable into Common Stock, in future transactions may be higher or lower than the price per share paid by existing stockholders. We have identified material weaknesses in our internal controls, and we cannot provide assurances that these weaknesses will be effectively remediated or that additional material weaknesses will not occur in the future If our internal control over financial reporting or our disclosure controls and procedures are not effective, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results, prevent fraud, or file our periodic reports in a timely manner, which may cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information and may lead to a decline in our stock price. Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over our financial reporting, as defined in Rule 13a- 15(f) under the Exchange Act. Based on our assessment, we have concluded that as of September 30, 2024 we did not maintain effective review controls at a sufficient level of precision with certain financial statement areas and over unusual transactions involving complex accounting and related. disclosure requirements. We also did not maintain effective information technology general controls over user access, program change management, and segregation of duties, within certain key information systems supporting our accounting and financial reporting processes. Additionally, many of our business process controls dependent upon the information derived from these information systems were also ineffective, as we did not design and implement controls to validate the completeness and accuracy of underlying data utilized in the operation of those controls. While we plan to take remedial action to address the material weaknesses, we cannot provide any assurance that such remedial measures, or any other remedial measures we take, will be effective. If we fail to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results, detect or prevent fraud, or file our periodic reports in a timely manner, which may, among other adverse consequences, cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information and lead to a decline in our stock price. In addition, a material weakness will not be considered remediated until the applicable controls operate for a sufficient period of time and management has concluded, through testing, that these controls are designed and operating effectively. Although management believes that the material weaknesses will be remediated by the end of the fiscal year there can be no assurance that the deficiencies will be remediated at such time or that the internal control over financial reporting, as modified, will enable us to identify or avoid material weaknesses in the future. We cannot assure you that our Common Stock will be liquid or that it will remain listed on the NYSE American. Our Common Stock is listed on the NYSE American. The NYSE American s listing standards generally mandate that we meet certain requirements relating to stockholders equity, stock price, market capitalization, aggregate market value of publicly held shares and distribution requirements We cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain the continued listing standards of the NYSE American. The NYSE American requires companies to meet certain continued listing criteria including a minimum stockholders equity of 6.0 million if an issuer has sustained losses from continuing operations and/or net losses in its five most recent years, as outlined in the NYSE American Company Guide and trading of the stock above 0.10 per share. The NYSE American Company Guide also states that the NYSE normally will not consider removing from listing securities of an issuer if it is in compliance with all of the following: a total value of market capitalization of at least 50.0 million; 1,100,000 publicly-held shares; a market value of publicly held shares of at least 15.0 million; and 400 round lot shareholders. In addition, the NYSE American has informed us that it can commence delisting proceedings and immediately suspend trading in the event that our Common Stock trades at levels viewed to be abnormally low and no longer suitable for listing pursuant to Section 1003(f)(v) of the NYSE American Company Guide. Generally the NYSE American views trading at or below a price of 0.10 to be abnormally low. As stated above, in the event that we were to fail to meet the requirements of NYSE American per share price requirement the NYSE American could commence delisting proceedings and immediately suspend trading of our Common Stock o the NYSE American or if we fail to meet other requirements such as the stockholders equity requirement and we could not timely cure such deficiency, our listing could become subject to NYSE American continued listing evaluation and follow-up procedures, which could result in delisting procedures. We previously received notification from the NYSE American citing failure to comply with the minimum stockholders equity continued listing standard as set forth in Part 10, Section 1003 of the Company Guide. Although in the past we have been able to cure previously cited deficiencies, there can be no assurance that we will continue to meet the NYSE American continued listing requirements.

Table of Contents 
 In addition, in the future we may not be able to ensure that our Common Stock trades at levels not viewed to be abnormally low and no longer suitable for listing or maintain minimum stockholders equity and/or issue additional equity securities in exchange for cash or other assets, if available, to maintain certain minimum stockholders equity required by the NYSE American. If we are delisted from the NYSE American then our Common Stock will trade, if at all, only on the over-the-counter market, such as the OTC Bulletin Board securities market, and then only if one or more registered broker-dealer market makers comply with quotation requirements. In addition, delisting of our Common Stock could depress our stock price, substantially limit liquidity of our Common Stock and materially adversely affect our ability to raise capital on terms acceptable to us, or at all. Delisting from the NYSE American could also have other negative results, including the potential loss of confidence by suppliers and employees, the loss of institutional investor interest and fewer business development opportunities. We cannot assure you that our Common Stock will be liquid or that it will remain listed on the NYSE American. A failure to regain compliance with the NYSE American stockholders equity requirements or failure to continue to meet the other listing requirements could result in a de-listing of our Common Stock. ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS. (a) Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities 
 We did not sell any equity securities during the three months ended September 30, 2024 in transactions that were not registered under the Securities Act other than as previously disclosed in our filings with the SEC. (b) Use of Proceeds 
 Not applicable. (c) Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities
