 MARINUS PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARY NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS reduction in our workforce in the fourth quarter of 2024. We also commenced a process to explore strategic alternatives with the goal of maximizing value for our stockholders and engaged Barclays as an advisor to assist in our review of strategic alternatives. There can be no assurance that the exploration of strategic alternatives will result in any agreements or transactions, or as to the timing of any such agreements or transactions. In June 2024, we announced top-line results from our Phase 3 RAISE trial of intravenous (IV) ganaxolone for the treatment of Refractory Status Epilepticus (RSE). Status Epilepticus (SE) is a life-threatening condition characterized by continuous, prolonged seizures or rapidly recurring seizures without intervening recovery of consciousness. If SE is not treated urgently, permanent neuronal damage may occur, which contributes to high rates of morbidity and mortality. Patients with SE who do not respond to first-line benzodiazepine treatment are classified as having Established Status Epilepticus (ESE) and those who then progress to and subsequently fail at least one second-line antiepileptic drug (AED) are classified as having RSE. The top-line results from RAISE showed that the trial met its first co-primary endpoint, a statistically significant proportion of patients had status epilepticus cessation within 30 minutes of initiating IV ganaxolone compared to placebo, but failed to achieve statistical significance on its second co-primary endpoint, the proportion of patients not progressing to IV anesthesia for 36 hours following initiation of IV ganaxolone compared to placebo. We continue to analyze the full RAISE dataset and are scheduled to meet with the FDA by the end of 2024 to discuss a potential path forward for IV ganaxolone in RSE. We had been developing ganaxolone in formulations for two different routes of administration: IV and oral. The different formulations were intended to maximize potential therapeutic applications of ganaxolone for adult and pediatric patient populations, in both acute and chronic care. While the precise mechanism by which ganaxolone exerts its therapeutic effects in the treatment of seizures is unknown, its anticonvulsant effects are thought to result from positive allosteric modulation of the gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABA A receptor in the central nervous system. Ganaxolone is a synthetic analog of allopregnanolone, an endogenous neurosteroid, and targets both synaptic and

 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. There is no assurance that profitable operations will be achieved in the future, and if achieved, could be sustained on a continuing basis. Our accumulated deficit as of September 30, 2024 was million, and we expect to incur substantial losses in future periods. Management s operating plan, which underlies the analysis of our ability to continue as a going concern, involves the estimation of the amount and timing of future cash inflows and outflows. Actual results could vary from the operating plan. We follow the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 205-40, Presentation of Financial Statements Going Concern, which requires management to assess our ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date the financial statements are issued. We had Cash and cash equivalents of million as of September 30, 2024. We believe that such amount is not sufficient to fund our operations for the one-year period after the date these financial statements are issued. As a result, there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern through the one-year period from the date these financial statements are issued. Cost reduction activities were implemented in the second and fourth quarters of 2024, as further discussed in Note 13 and Note 14. As a result of the TrustTSC outcome announced in October 2024, we discontinued further ganaxolone clinical development, other than activities required by the FDA and EMA specific to post-approval commitments of Ztalmy for CDD, and have taken additional steps to reduce costs, including an approximate reduction in our workforce in the fourth quarter of 2024. We also commenced a process to explore strategic alternatives with the goal of maximizing value for our stockholders and engaged Barclays as an advisor to assist in our review of strategic alternatives. There can be no assurance that the exploration of strategic alternatives will result in any agreements or transactions, or as to the timing of any such agreements or transactions.

 customers, of which, Orsini Pharmaceutical Services, LLC (Orsini), a specialty pharmacy that dispenses ZTALMY directly to patients, represents approximately of our ZTALMY revenue to date. Our contract with Orsini has a single performance obligation to deliver ZTALMY upon receipt of a purchase order, which is satisfied when Orsini receives ZTALMY. We recognize ZTALMY revenue at the point in time when control of ZTALMY is transferred to Orsini, which is upon delivery to Orsini. The transaction price that we recognize for ZTALMY revenue includes an estimate of variable consideration. Shipping and handling costs to Orsini are recorded as selling, general and administrative expenses. The components of variable consideration include: Trade Discounts and Allowances. We provide contractual discounts, including incentive prompt payment discounts and chargebacks. Each of these potential discounts is recorded as a reduction of ZTALMY revenue and Accounts receivable in the period in which the related ZTALMY revenue is recognized. We estimate the amount of variable consideration for all discounts and allowances using the expected value method. Product Returns and Recall. We provide for ZTALMY returns in accordance with our Return Good Policy. We estimate the amount of ZTALMY that may be returned using the expected value method, and we present this amount as a reduction of ZTALMY revenue in the period the related ZTALMY revenue is recognized. In the event of a recall, we will promptly notify Orsini and will reimburse Orsini for direct administrative expenses incurred in connection with the recall as well as the cost of replacement product. Government Rebates. We are subject to discount obligations under state Medicaid programs, Medicare and the Tricare Retail Refund Program. We estimate reserves related to these discount programs and record these obligations in the same period the related revenue is recognized, resulting in a reduction of ZTALMY revenue. Patient Assistance . We offer a voluntary co-pay patient assistance program intended to provide financial assistance to eligible patients with a prescription drug co-payment required by payors and coupon programs for cash payors. The calculation of the Current liability for this assistance is based on an estimate of claims and the cost per claim that we expect to receive associated with ZTALMY that has been recognized as Product revenue but remains in the distribution channel inventories at the end of each reporting period.

 million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. As of both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had allowance for doubtful accounts. An allowance for doubtful accounts is determined based on our assessment of the credit worthiness and financial condition of our customers, aging of receivables, as well as the general economic environment. Any allowance would reduce the net receivables to the amount that is expected to be collected. We have customers, of which, Orsini Pharmaceutical Services, LLC (Orsini), a specialty pharmacy that dispenses ZTALMY directly to patients, represents approximately of our ZTALMY revenue to date. Payment terms for Orsini are from the shipment date.

 million for commercially saleable product and materials were incurred and included in Research and development expenses. As a result, Cost of product revenues related to ZTALMY initially reflected a lower average per unit cost of materials and continued to do so into the second quarter of 2024, as previously expensed inventory was utilized for commercial production and sold to customers. We expect Cost of product revenues related to ZTALMY to begin to reflect the current on-going average per unit cost of materials for the remainder of 2024 and thereafter.

Underwritten Public Offering In connection with an underwritten public offering in November 2022 and the closing of the related exercise of the underwriters option in December 2022, we issued a total of shares of common stock and pre-funded warrants (the Pre-funded Warrants) resulting in aggregate net proceeds, after underwriting discounts and commissions in the public offering and fees, of million. The exercise price and the number of shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of each Pre-funded Warrant are subject to appropriate adjustment in the event of certain stock dividends and distributions, stock splits, stock combinations, reclassifications or similar events affecting the common stock as well as upon any distribution of assets, including cash, stock or other property, to our stockholders. The Pre-funded Warrants are exercisable at any time, will not expire and are exercisable in cash or by means of a cashless exercise.

As of September 30, 2024, our operating lease for real estate had a remaining lease term of . The right-of-use (ROU) asset is included in Other assets on our interim consolidated balance sheets as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, and represents our right to use the underlying asset for the applicable lease terms. Our obligations to make lease payments are included in both Accrued expenses and Other long-term liabilities on our interim consolidated balance sheets as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Additionally, we entered into several operating leases for clinical site equipment which were subsequently cancelled due to the discontinuation of the RAISE II trial. Our operating leases for clinical site equipment each had a term of prior to the May 2024 terminations of each lease. The ROU assets were included in Other assets on our consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2023, and represented our right to use the underlying assets for the applicable lease terms. The ROU assets related to the clinical site equipment operating leases were written off and included in restructuring costs for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Our obligations to make lease payments were included in both Accrued expenses and Other long-term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2023. All ROU assets were initially measured at cost, which comprise the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for lease payments made at or before the lease commencement date, plus any initial direct costs incurred, less any lease incentives received. The ROU asset(s) are subsequently measured throughout the lease term at the carrying amount of the lease liability, plus initial direct costs, plus (minus) any prepaid (accrued) lease payments, less the unamortized balance of lease incentives received. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, ROU assets were million and million, respectively, and operating lease liabilities were million and million, respectively. We have entered into various short-term operating leases, primarily for clinical trial equipment, with an initial term of twelve months or less. These leases are not recorded on our balance sheets. All operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recognized million and million, respectively, in total lease costs, of which million recognized during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were restructuring costs resulting from the RAISE II trial equipment lease terminations as noted above. During each of the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recognized million in total lease costs. In all periods, we recognized less than million related to short-term operating leases. Because the rate implicit in each lease is not readily determinable, we use our incremental borrowing rate to determine the present value of the lease payments. The weighted average incremental borrowing rate used to determine the initial value of ROU assets and lease liabilities was , derived from a corporate yield curve based on a synthetic credit rating model using a market signal analysis. We have certain contracts for real estate which may contain lease and non-lease components which we have elected to treat as a single lease component. ROU assets for operating leases are periodically reduced by impairment losses. We use the long-lived assets impairment guidance in ASC Subtopic 360-10, Property, Plant, and Equipment Overall, to determine whether an ROU asset is impaired, and if so, the amount of the impairment loss to recognize. As of September 30, 2024, we recognized million of impairment losses for our ROU asset related to the RAISE II trial equipment leases. These costs were including in restructuring costs in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. There were impairment losses recorded for the three months ended September 30, 2024. As of December 31, 2023, we had t recognized any impairment losses for our ROU assets.

In May 2022, we entered into an amendment (the Credit Agreement Amendment) to extend the commitment date for the tranche C Term Loans (Tranche C Term Loans) commitment from June 30, 2023 to December 31, 2023, and to eliminate the commitment fees associated with the Tranche C Term Loans. Also in May 2022, we delivered to Oaktree a separate notice of commitment termination with respect to the tranche D term loans (Tranche D Term Loans) commitment. In October 2022, we entered into an amendment to, among other things, allow for the consummation of the Revenue Interest Financing Agreement with Sagard and the transactions thereunder.

 million of previously drawn Term Loans with no additional funds available thereunder. Until the June 6, 2024 amendment, the Credit Agreement contained a minimum liquidity covenant that required us to maintain cash and cash equivalents of at least million from the funding date of the Tranche B Term Loans until the maturity of the Term Loans. The Term Loans will be guaranteed by certain of our future subsidiaries (Guarantors). Our obligations under the Credit Agreement are secured by a pledge of substantially all of our assets and will be secured by a pledge of substantially all of the assets of the Guarantors. The Term Loans mature on May 11, 2026 (Maturity Date). The Term Loans bear interest at a fixed per annum rate (subject to increase during an event of default) of , and we are required to make quarterly interest payments until the Maturity Date. We are also required to make quarterly principal payments beginning on June 30, 2024 in an amount equal to of the aggregate amount of the previously drawn Term Loans, and continuing until 2025, at which time we are required to make quarterly principal payments in an amount equal to of the aggregate amount of the previously drawn Term Loans until the Maturity Date. On the Maturity Date, we are required to pay in full all outstanding Term Loans and other amounts owed under the Credit Agreement. At the time of borrowing any tranche of the Term Loans, we were required to pay an upfront fee of of the aggregate principal amount borrowed at that time. In addition, a commitment fee of basis points per annum began to accrue on each of the tranche B, C, and D commitments for the period beginning after the funding date of the Tranche A-2 Term Loans and continued until the applicable tranche was either funded or terminated, at which time the related commitment fees were due. The Tranche A-2 Term Loans were funded on September 27, 2021, and as such, we began accruing the commitment fees for tranche B, C, and D Term Loans later, on January 25, 2022. We drew down the additional million of Tranche B Term Loans in March 2022, and paid less than million in commitment fees related to Tranche B Term Loans.

If prepayment occurs after May 11, 2025, prepayment premium is due. The June 2024 prepayment of million resulted in an additional million of prepayment premiums that are included in interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. In addition, we are required to pay an exit fee in an amount equal to of all principal repaid, whether as a mandatory prepayment, voluntary prepayment, or a scheduled repayment. Prior to the October 28, 2022 amendment to the Credit Agreement, the exit fee was . The increase in the exit fee resulted in an additional million of debt issuance costs that are classified as a contra-liability on the consolidated balance sheets and is being recognized as Interest expense over the term of the loan using the effective interest method.

The Payments are subject to a hard cap equal to of the Investment Amount (Hard Cap) or million. Sagard s right to receive payments will terminate when Sagard has received payments in respect of the Included Products, including any additional payments described below, equal to the Hard Cap. Further, we have the right to make voluntary prepayments to Sagard, and such payments will be credited against the Hard Cap. If Sagard has not received aggregate payments equaling at least of the Investment Amount by December 31, 2027 or at least of the Investment Amount by December 31, 2032 (each, a Minimum Amount), then we will be obligated to make a cash payment to Sagard in an amount sufficient to gross up Sagard up to the applicable Minimum Amount within a specified period of time after each reference date. The obligations under the Revenue Interest Financing Agreement, including the Payments, will be guaranteed by certain of our future subsidiaries that are required to become a party thereto as guarantors (Guarantors).

 million million) upfront payment from Orion in July 2021. In connection with the upfront fee, we agreed to provide Orion with the results of a planned genotoxicity study on the M2 metabolite of ganaxolone, a Combined Micronucleus Comet study in vivo. In May 2022, the final study report was received, which confirmed that no genotoxicity was found, as measured by formation of micronuclei in the bone marrow or comet morphology in the liver. In the event that the results of such study were positive, based on the criteria set forth in the study s protocol, Orion would have had the right to terminate the Orion Collaboration Agreement within ninety 90 days after its receipt of the final report of such study, in which case we would have been required to refund Orion percent of the upfront fee. We are eligible to receive up to an additional million in R D reimbursement and cash milestone payments based on specific clinical and commercial achievements, as well as tiered royalty payments based on net sales ranging from the low double-digits to high teens for the oral programs and the low double-digits to low 20s for the IV program. Also, as part of the overall arrangement, we have agreed to supply the Licensed Products to Orion at an agreed upon price. The Orion Collaboration Agreement shall remain effective until the date of expiration of the last to expire Royalty Term, which is defined as the period beginning on the date of the first commercial sale Licensed Product in such country and ending on the latest to occur of (a) the tenth (10th) anniversary of the first commercial sale of Licensed Product in such country, (b) the expiration of the last-to-expire licensed patent covering the manufacture, use or sale of such Licensed Product in such country, and (c) the expiration of regulatory exclusivity period, if any, for such Licensed Product in such country. The Orion Collaboration Agreement has a term of at least ten 10 years since a commercial sale has yet to occur. The Orion Collaboration Agreement allows for termination in certain specific events, such as material breach, in the event Orion challenges the validity, enforceability or scope of the licensed patent rights, termination for forecast failure, insolvency and force majeure, none of which are probable at contract inception. In accordance with the guidance, we identified the following commitments under the arrangement: (i) exclusive rights to develop, use, sell, have sold, offer for sale and import any product comprised of Licensed Product (License) (ii) development and regulatory activities (Development and Regulatory Activities), and (iii) requirement to supply Orion with the Licensed Product at an agreed upon price (Supply of Licensed Product). We determined that these three commitments represent distinct performance obligations for purposes of recognizing revenue or reducing expense, which we will recognize such revenue or expense, as applicable, as we fulfill these performance obligations. At contract inception, we determined that the non-refundable portion of the upfront payment plus the research and development reimbursement constitutes the transaction price as of the outset of the Orion Collaboration Agreement. The refundable portion of the upfront payment and the future potential regulatory and development milestone payments were fully constrained at contract inception as the risk of significant revenue reversal related to these amounts had not yet been resolved. During 2022, the refundable portion of the upfront payment was determined to be included in the transaction price as the final genotoxicity study on the M2 metabolite of ganaxolone was received as described above and the remaining million of the upfront payment was recorded as collaboration revenue in the year ended December 31, 2022. The achievement of the future potential milestones is not within our control and is subject to certain research and development success and therefore carry significant uncertainty. As a result of the July 2023 EC approval of ZTALMY oral suspension for the adjunctive treatment of epileptic seizures associated with CDD in patients two to 17 years of age, we are now eligible under the Orion Collaboration Agreement to receive a commercial milestone payment of million, if commercial sales of ZTALMY commence in the Territory, due upon the earlier of (1) the first commercial sale of ZTALMY within two of a select set of countries consisting of Germany, France, Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom and (2) the 18-month anniversary of the first commercial sale of ZTALMY in the Territory. We will reevaluate the likelihood of achieving these milestones at the end of each reporting period and adjust the transaction price in the period the risk is resolved. In addition, we will recognize any consideration related to sales-based milestones and royalties when the subsequent sales occur since those payments relate primarily to the License, which was delivered by us to Orion upon entering into the Orion Collaboration Agreement. The transaction price was allocated to the performance obligations based on the estimated stand-alone selling prices at contract inception. The stand-alone selling price of the License was based on a discounted cash flow approach and considered several factors including, but not limited to, discount rate, development timeline, regulatory risks, estimated market demand and future revenue potential using an adjusted market approach. The stand-alone selling

 million and a total contract asset of million. In accordance with ASC 210-20, the contract liability was offset by the contract asset related to the reimbursement of research and development costs, which resulted in a net contract liability of million as of December 31, 2023. Transaction Price and Net Contract Liability as of December 31, 2023: - Development and Regulatory Services Supply of Licensed Product - Less Total Contract Asset Net Contract Liability During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we amortized million of the transaction price associated with the Development and Regulatory Services as a reduction of research and development costs. These reductions to the transaction price resulted in a total contract liability of million as of September 30, 2024. In accordance with ASC 210-20, the contract liability of million is offset by the contract asset of million related to the reimbursement of research and development costs, resulting in a net contract liability of million as of September 30, 2024.

These contract acquisition costs were allocated consistent with the transaction price, resulting in million of expense recorded to selling, general and administrative expense commensurate with the recognition of the License performance obligation and million recorded as capitalized contract costs, included in other current assets and other assets, which are being amortized as Development and Regulatory Services and Supply of Licensed Product obligations are met. Tenacia Collaboration Agreement On November 16, 2022 (Effective Date), we entered into a Collaboration and Supply Agreement (Tenacia Collaboration Agreement) with Tenacia Biotechnology (Shanghai) Co., Ltd. (Tenacia).

Of the milestones, million relates to regulatory approvals with separate milestones related to each of oral and intravenous formulations and the Selected Product, and an aggregate of million of sales-based milestones are connected to annual revenue thresholds specific to each of the oral, intravenous and Selected Product formulations of ganaxolone. Tenacia has further agreed to pay us tiered royalty payments based on annual net sales of Licensed Products ranging from the low double digits to the mid-teens for each of the oral formulation, intravenous formulation and Selected Product formulation of Licensed Products. Tenacia s obligations to pay royalties to us with respect to sales of a Licensed Product in each particular jurisdiction of the Territory will commence on the date of first commercial sale in such jurisdiction and expire upon the latest of (i) following the first commercial sale of such Licensed Product in such jurisdiction, (ii) the expiration of the last-to-expire valid claim of any licensed patent rights that covers such Licensed Product in such jurisdiction and (iii) the expiration of all regulatory exclusivities for such Licensed Product in such jurisdiction. Royalty payments are subject to reduction in specified circumstances as set forth in the Tenacia Collaboration Agreement, including if net sales decrease by a certain percentage after the introduction of a generic product. Tenacia will be primarily responsible for the development of Licensed Products in the Territory and regulatory interactions related thereto, including conducting and sponsoring clinical studies in the Field in the Territory to support regulatory filings in the Territory. All regulatory approvals filed by Tenacia in the Territory will be in the name of and owned by us unless otherwise required by applicable law, in which case such regulatory approvals would be in the name of and owned by Tenacia for the benefit of us. We and Tenacia have agreed to enter into clinical and commercial supply agreements pursuant to which we will supply Tenacia with its requirements of Licensed Products necessary for Tenacia to develop and commercialize Licensed Products in the Field in the Territory. The parties entered into the clinical and commercial supply agreement in May 2023. The agreement contains pricing, delivery, acceptance, payment, termination, forecasting, and other terms consistent with the Tenacia Collaboration Agreement, as well as certain quality assurance, indemnification, liability and other standard industry terms. Tenacia will be responsible for, at Tenacia s sole cost and expense, obtaining regulatory approval and commercializing the Licensed Product in the Field in Mainland China. Tenacia enrolled patients in our Phase 3 randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled trial (TrustTSC trial) of adjunctive ganaxolone.

Overview We are a commercial-stage pharmaceutical company dedicated to the development of innovative therapeutics for the treatment of seizure disorders, including rare genetic epilepsies and status epilepticus (SE). On March 18, 2022, the FDA approved our new drug application (NDA) for the use of ZTALMY (ganaxolone) oral suspension CV for the treatment of seizures associated with CDD in patients two years of age and older. ZTALMY, our first FDA approved product, became available for commercial sale and shipment in the third quarter of 2022. On July 28, 2023, the EC granted marketing authorization for ZTALMY for the adjunctive treatment of epileptic seizures associated with CDD in patients two to 17 years of age. ZTALMY may be continued in patients 18 years of age and older. We have an exclusive collaboration agreement with Orion for European commercialization of ganaxolone for ZTALMY. Orion has prepared for the expected commercial launches of ZTALMY in select European countries, and they have informed us that they will be considering the outcome of our strategic alternatives review we announced on October 24, 2024 before committing to launch timing and further launch preparations. On July 18, 2024, we announced that the China National Medical Products Administration (CNMPA) has approved ganaxolone oral suspension for the treatment of epileptic seizures in patients two years of age and older with CDD. We have a collaboration agreement with Tenacia for the commercialization of ganaxolone in Mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan. We had been developing ganaxolone in formulations for two different routes of administration: IV and oral. The different formulations were intended to maximize potential therapeutic applications of ganaxolone for adult and pediatric patient populations, in both acute and chronic care. We had been pursuing the development of ganaxolone for selected indications based on the mechanism of action and clinical profile of ganaxolone. While the precise mechanism by which ganaxolone exerts its therapeutic effects in the treatment of seizures is unknown, its anticonvulsant effects are thought to result from positive allosteric modulation of the gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABA A receptor in the central nervous system. Ganaxolone is a synthetic analog of allopregnanolone, an endogenous neurosteroid, and targets both synaptic and extrasynaptic GABA A . This unique receptor binding profile may contribute to the anticonvulsant, antidepressant and anxiolytic effects shown by neuroactive steroids in animal models, clinical trials or both. On October 24, 2024, we announced top-line data from our Phase 3 trial in Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC) clinical trial (TrustTSC). TSC is a rare, multisystem genetic disorder caused by inherited mutations in the TSC1 gene or TSC2 gene. TSC is often characterized by non-cancerous tumors, skin abnormalities, and severe neurological manifestations including refractory seizures and neurodevelopmental delays. TSC is a leading cause of genetic epilepsy. TrustTSC did not meet the primary endpoint of percent change in 28-day TSC-associated seizure frequency. As a result of the TrustTSC outcome, we discontinued further ganaxolone clinical development, other than activities required by the FDA and EMA specific to post-approval commitments of Ztalmy for CDD, and have taken additional steps to reduce costs, including an approximate 45 reduction in our workforce in the fourth quarter of 2024. We also commenced a process to explore strategic alternatives with the goal of maximizing value for our stockholders and engaged Barclays as an advisor to assist in our review of strategic alternatives. There can be no assurance that the exploration of strategic alternatives will result in any agreements or transactions, or as to the timing of any such agreements or transactions.

 In June 2024, we announced top-line results from our RAISE trial of intravenous (IV) ganaxolone for the treatment of RSE. SE is a life-threatening condition characterized by continuous, prolonged seizures or rapidly recurring seizures without intervening recovery of consciousness. If SE is not treated urgently, permanent neuronal damage may occur, which contributes to high rates of morbidity and mortality. Patients with SE who do not respond to first-line benzodiazepine treatment are classified as having Established Status Epilepticus (ESE) and those who then progress to and subsequently fail at least one second-line antiepileptic drug (AED) are classified as having RSE. The top-line results from RAISE showed that the trial met its first co-primary endpoint, a statistically significant proportion of patients had status epilepticus cessation within 30 minutes of initiating IV ganaxolone compared to placebo: 80 vs. 13 , respectively (p Our Oral Product and Product Candidates ZTALMY (ganaxolone) oral suspension CV ZTALMY is an oral suspension given three times per day that we have developed for the treatment of CDD-associated seizures. CDD is a serious and rare genetic disorder that is caused by a mutation of the CDKL5 gene, located on the X chromosome. CDD is a severely debilitating and potentially fatal genetic condition, which occurs with an estimated frequency of 1:40,000 live births in the U.S. It predominantly affects females and is characterized by early onset, difficult to control seizures and severe neurodevelopmental impairment. The CDKL5 gene encodes proteins essential for normal brain structure and function. Most children affected by CDD have neurodevelopmental deficits such as difficulty walking, talking and taking care of themselves. Many also suffer from scoliosis, gastrointestinal dysfunction or sleep disorders. Genetic testing is available to determine if a patient has a mutation in the CDKL5 gene. ZTALMY was approved by the FDA in March 2022 for the treatment of seizures associated with CDD in patients two years of age and older. ZTALMY, our first FDA approved product, became available for commercial sale and shipment in the third quarter of 2022. We recorded ZTALMY net product revenue of 8.5 million and 23.9 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. We recorded ZTALMY net product revenue of 5.4 million and 13.0 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. On July 28, 2023, the EC granted marketing authorization for ZTALMY for the adjunctive treatment of epileptic seizures associated with CDD in patients two to 17 years of age. ZTALMY may be continued in patients 18 years of age and older. With the EC marketing authorization granted for ZTALMY, Orion, our commercialization partner for ZTALMY in Europe, has prepared for the expected commercial launches of ZTALMY in select European countries, and they have informed us that they will be considering the outcome of our strategic alternatives review we announced on October 24, 2024 before committing to launch timing and further launch preparations. The pricing and reimbursement process can be time-consuming and may delay Orion s commercial launch of ZTALMY in one or more European countries. In June 2017, we were granted FDA orphan drug designation for ganaxolone for the treatment of CDD. The designation provides the drug developer with a seven-year period of U.S. marketing exclusivity, tax credits for clinical research costs, the ability to apply for annual grant funding, clinical research trial design assistance and waiver of Prescription Drug User Fee Act filing fees. In July 2020, the FDA granted Rare Pediatric Disease Designation (RPD Designation) for ganaxolone for the treatment of CDD. The FDA grants RPD Designation for diseases that affect fewer than 200,000 people in the U.S. and in which the serious or life-threatening manifestations occur primarily in individuals 18 years of age and younger. Upon FDA approval of ZTALMY for CDD in March 2022, the FDA awarded us a Rare Pediatric Disease Priority Review Voucher (PRV), which we monetized in August 2022 for 110.0 million in cash. In August 2022, we received a letter from Purdue Neuroscience Company (Purdue) in which Purdue claimed that it was owed 5.5 million by us from the sale of the PRV pursuant to the Purdue License Agreement. We responded to Purdue that we did not agree with their claim. In February 2024, following discussions with Purdue, we agreed to pay Purdue 4.0 million in respect of its claim. The first 2.0 million installment was paid to Purdue in March 2024, and the second 2.0 million installment was paid in June 2024.

 In November 2019, the European Medicines Agency s (EMA) Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products (COMP) granted orphan drug designation for ganaxolone for the treatment of CDD. Prior to the grant of the marketing authorization, the COMP was required to determine whether the orphan drug designation criteria were still met. On May 26, 2023, the COMP provided a positive opinion to maintain the orphan drug designation for ganaxolone for CDD in the EU. The U.S. and EC approvals of ZTALMY for CDD are based on data from a Phase 3 double-blind placebo-controlled trial (Marigold Trial), in which 101 patients were randomized and treated with ZTALMY. Clinical trial patients receiving ZTALMY showed a median 30.7 reduction in 28-day major motor seizure frequency, compared to a median 6.9 reduction for those receiving placebo, achieving the trial s primary endpoint (p=0.0036). At two years in the open label extension phase of the Marigold Trial, patients (n=50) treated with ZTALMY experienced a median 48.2 reduction in major motor seizure frequency. These data suggest that patients who remain on treatment long-term may demonstrate continued reductions in seizure frequency. The most common adverse events (AEs) in the double-blind portion of the Marigold Trial were somnolence (36.0 in the ganaxolone group compared to 15.7 in the placebo group), pyrexia (18.0 and 7.8 , respectively) and salivary hypersecretion (6.0 and 2.0 , respectively). We own families of patents and pending patent applications that claim certain formulations of ganaxolone and cover certain therapeutic uses of ganaxolone, including for treating CDD. The 20-year terms for patents, and applications that issue as patents, in these families run from 2026 through 2042, absent any available patent term adjustments or extensions. We have also licensed from Ovid certain patents that claim certain therapeutic uses of ganaxolone for the treatment of CDD. The licensed patents include a granted U.S. patent, and pending applications in the U.S. and Europe. The 20-year term for these licensed patents and applications that issue as patents will run through 2037, absent any available patent term adjustments. U.S. Commercial Strategy. Since ZTALMY was approved by the FDA, we have been focused on the implementation and execution of an integrated launch plan to make ZTALMY available to CDD patients in the U.S. through a specialty pharmacy. Key commercial strategies have included and continue to include: (1) executing our supply chain network and quality management system to assure product is available to patients; (2) driving clinical awareness of ZTALMY as the first and only FDA approved product indicated specifically for seizures associated with CDD; (3) deploying our field sales force to target physicians who treat this rare pediatric patient population; (4) engaging commercial and government payers with the objective of obtaining insurance coverage; and (5) enhancing our internal capabilities (such as Finance, Human Resources, Information Technology, Data Analytics and Compliance) to support our first launch as a commercial company. U.S. Marketing Strategy . Our marketing strategy in the U.S. is to reinforce that seizures are central to the constellation of CDD symptoms, establish ZTALMY as central to the comprehensive management of seizures associated with CDD, and ensure that patients have seamless access to ZTALMY from prescription through fulfillment. Our marketing campaign for ZTALMY is active, and our integrated commercial launch activities initiated in the third quarter of 2022. U.S. Sales Strategy . Our U.S. commercial strategy divides our sales territories into 16 U.S. territories where our experienced regional account managers target key accounts and centers of excellence for CDD. Based on market research, we estimate the addressable patient population for ZTALMY for CDD in the U.S. is approximately 2,000 pediatric patients. As this is the first product approved by the FDA specifically for seizures associated with CDD and the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD10) code for CDD was established in 2021, there is limited data available for this specific market. U.S. Market Access . We have established a payer and reimbursement account team with the objective of obtaining and maintaining reimbursement (coverage) of ZTALMY in the U.S. We are focusing our efforts on reimbursement from commercial payers where pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) control the majority of commercial pharmacy-benefit lives and government payers, primarily Medicaid for the target population for CDD. We expect approximately 50 of the CDD patient population will access primary coverage through Fee-for-Service or Managed Medicaid, with the remaining approximately 50 accessing primary coverage through commercial payers, with the top PBMs having significant influence. The prescribing and fulfillment process for ZTALMY in the U.S. is managed

 through ZTALMY One , a comprehensive patient support program. Enrollment in the program offers various support and information to help caregivers and patients prescribed ZTALMY access their ZTALMY prescription and assist in determining eligibility for and access to co-pay support or free drug programs. U.S. Specialty Pharmacy . We are utilizing Orsini Pharmaceutical Services, LLC (Orsini), a specialty pharmacy, to provide services for patients in the U.S., including patient enrollment, benefit verification and investigation, prior authorization support, patient education and drug counseling, dispensing of product and shipment coordination . U.S. Specialty Distributor . We are utilizing ASD Specialty Healthcare, LLC (ASD), a specialty distributor, to provide distribution services in the U.S. in connection with ZTALMY to institutional inpatient pharmacies, U.S. governmental customers, including any Department of Veterans Affairs or Department of Defense sites, and Kaiser Permanente facilities. Infrastructure . We continue to enhance our internal capabilities and processes to support a commercial-stage company. We have implemented a healthcare compliance program to guide our compliance with rules and regulations regarding pharmaceutical sales. Manufacture of Commercial Supply . We have executed commercial supply agreements for ganaxolone active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) with our current manufacturer and also with our current supplier for finished bulk drug product. Additionally, we have executed a master supply agreement with a second API supplier to undertake certain process development activities and potentially provide commercial supplies of API and/or API intermediates. Regulated as a Controlled Substance in the U.S . On June 1, 2022, the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) published an interim final rule in the Federal Register placing ganaxolone and its salts in schedule V of the Controlled Substances Act (CSA), which rule became final December 9, 2022. Under the CSA, drugs are classified into five (5) distinct categories or schedules depending upon the drug s acceptable medical use and the drug s abuse or dependency potential. Schedule V is defined by the DEA as drugs with lower potential for abuse than schedule IV and consist of preparations containing limited quantities of certain narcotics. ZTALMY became available for commercial sale and shipment in the third quarter of 2022. As a controlled substance, ganaxolone is subject to the applicable CSA requirements such as registration, security, recordkeeping and reporting, storage manufacturing, distribution, importation and other requirements. FDA Post-Marketing Requirements . In connection with FDA approval of ZTALMY for CDD, we have several post-marketing commitments. The Phase 1 renal impairment study commitment was submitted to the FDA in May 2022, the Phase 1 hepatic impairment study and the thorough QTc study were submitted to the FDA in December 2022, the extractable/leachable study results on the container closure system were submitted to the FDA in July 2023, the M17 in vitro drug-drug interaction (DDI) study was submitted in August 2023, and the M17 in vivo PK study with Brain Penetrance was submitted in December 2023. The remaining post-marketing requirements include: 2-year carcinogenicity studies of ganaxolone and the major human unconjugated plasma metabolite, M2, in rats; a 26-week carcinogenicity of ganaxolone in transgenic mice; and a juvenile animal toxicity study of M2 in rats. We expect to be able to complete these remaining required FDA studies and are working with the FDA with respect to the timing of their completion and submission. While we have discontinued further ganaxolone clinical development, we will continue to complete activities required by the FDA specific to post-approval commitments of Ztalmy for CDD. Managed Access Program (MAPS) . We have a global managed access program with Uniphar Durbin Ireland LTD to support physician access to ZTALMY for appropriate patients with seizures associated with CDD in geographies where there is no available patient access, local regulatory criteria and program eligibility are satisfied, and we do not already have a commercial distribution relationship in place. Marketing Authorization Application In August 2021, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the EMA granted our request for accelerated assessment of ganaxolone for the treatment of seizures associated with CDD. The marketing authorization application (MAA) for ganaxolone was submitted to the EMA on October 11, 2021, and on October 28,

 2021, we received formal notification from the EMA that the CDD MAA was validated. With this validation, the EMA began its formal review of the MAA under the centralized procedure. On May 26, 2023, the CHMP adopted a positive opinion recommending approval of ZTALMY. On July 28, 2023, the EC approved ZTALMY oral suspension for the adjunctive treatment of epileptic seizures associated with CDD in patients two to 17 years of age. ZTALMY may be continued in patients 18 years of age and older. The EC decision is applicable to all 27 EU member states plus Iceland, Norway and Liechtenstein. ZTALMY is the first treatment in the EU indicated for the treatment of seizures associated with CDD. EC Post-Authorization Measures . In connection with the EC approval of ZTALMY for CDD, we have several post-marketing authorization measures. The clinical study report (CSR) for Study 1042-HME-1001 was submitted in September 2023. The ganaxolone Steady-State Metabolite Study report, the final Study 1042-CDD-3001 CSR with the open-label trial completion, the M17 in vitro DDI study, and the M17 in vivo PK study with Brain Penetrance were submitted in December 2023. The updated Environmental Risk Assessment, including a Sediment Dwelling Organism toxicity study, was submitted in February 2024. The remaining post-marketing authorization measures include: participating in Study LLF001 (CANDID observational study) and providing annual updates; participating in the CDD-IPR-CDD-0 CDKL5 Deficiency Disorder International Patient Registry and providing six monthly updates; developing a sodium benzoate-free suspension and assessing the compatibility of the oral suspension with food, drinks, enteral tubes, shake time and stand time; conducting a 26-Week Oral Gavage Toxicity Study of M2; conducting a M2 Embryo-fetal Development study; and conducting a 26-week Oral Gavage Carcinogenicity Study of ganaxolone and M2. The EMA also requested weight of evidence (WoE) assessments to evaluate the need for a 2-year carcinogenicity study in rats with ganaxolone, a 2-year carcinogenicity study in rats with M2, and a juvenile toxicity study with M2. We expect to be able complete the remaining required studies and are working with the EMA with respect to the timing of their completion and submission. While we have discontinued further ganaxolone clinical development, we will continue to complete activities required by the EMA specific to post-approval commitments of Ztalmy for CDD. Ganaxolone for CDD approved by the China National Medical Products Administration On July 18, 2024, we announced that the CNMPA approved ganaxolone oral suspension for the treatment of epileptic seizures in patients two years of age and older with CDD. In November 2022, we entered into a collaboration agreement with Tenacia which granted Tenacia the right to develop and commercialize ganaxolone in Mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan in exchange for royalties and other payments associated with net sales and commercial and regulatory milestones. Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC) TSC is a rare genetic disorder that causes non-malignant tumors in the brain, skin, kidney, heart, eyes, and lungs. Rarely, patients may develop malignant tumors of the kidney, breast or thyroid gland. The condition is caused by inherited mutations in either the TSC1 or TSC2 gene. It occurs with a frequency of approximately 1:6,000 live births, with a genetic mutation being found in 85 of patients. While the disease phenotype can be extremely variable, epilepsy occurs with a frequency of up to 85 . TSC is a leading cause of genetic epilepsy, often manifesting in the first year of life as either focal seizures or infantile spasms. There are currently few disease-specific treatments approved for seizures in TSC. Orphan drug designation for ganaxolone for the treatment in TSC was granted by the FDA in August 2021 and by the EMA in October 2021. On October 24, 2024, we announced top-line data from the TrustTSC trial. The trial did not meet the primary endpoint of percent change in 28-day TSC-associated seizure frequency. The top-line data demonstrated that TrustTSC did not achieve statistical significance on its primary endpoint of percent reduction in 28-day frequency of TSC-associated seizures: median reduction was 19.7 for ganaxolone compared with 10.2 for placebo (p=0.09). In this trial, ganaxolone was generally well-tolerated with a safety profile consistent with previous clinical trials. In this trial, the most frequent adverse event was somnolence: 28.1 for ganaxolone compared with 16.9 for placebo. As a result of the TrustTSC outcome, we discontinued further ganaxolone clinical development, other than activities required by the FDA and EMA specific to post-approval commitments of Ztalmy for CDD, and have taken additional steps to reduce costs, including an approximate 45 reduction in our workforce in the fourth quarter of 2024. We also commenced a process to explore strategic alternatives with the goal of maximizing value for our stockholders and engaged Barclays as

 an advisor to assist in our review of strategic alternatives. There can be no assurance that the exploration of strategic alternatives will result in any agreements or transactions, or as to the timing of any such agreements or transactions. In July 2023, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office USPTO) granted us a patent (U.S. Patent No. 11,701,367) on certain methods for treating TSC-related epilepsy by administering oral ganaxolone. This issued patent expires in 2040. In May 2024, the USPTO granted us a second patent (U.S. Patent No. 11,980,625) on methods for treating TSC-related epilepsy by administering oral ganaxolone. This issued patent expires in 2040. In October 2024, the USPTO granted us a patent (U.S. Patent No. 12,115,169) for ZTALMY (ganaxolone) oral titration regimens covering the treatment of a range of epilepsy disorders, including CDD, TSC and LGS. This issued patent expires in 2042. We continue to prosecute patent applications in this family relating to certain therapeutic regimens for the treatment of TSC. Other Oral Development for Ganaxolone We had plans to pursue the development of ganaxolone in Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome (LGS), other epileptic encephalopathies , and prodrug formulations. As a result of the TrustTSC results, we have discontinued further ganaxolone clinical development, other than activities required by the FDA and EMA specific to post-approval commitments of Ztalmy for CDD. Our IV Product Candidates Status Epilepticus (SE) SE is a life-threatening condition characterized by continuous, prolonged seizures or rapidly recurring seizures without intervening recovery of consciousness. If SE is not treated urgently, permanent neuronal damage may occur, which contributes to high rates of morbidity and mortality. Patients with SE who do not respond to first-line benzodiazepine treatment are classified as having ESE and those who then progress to and subsequently fail at least one second-line AED are classified as having RSE. In RSE, synaptic GABA A receptors are internalized into the neuron, resulting in decreased responsiveness to drugs such as benzodiazepines. RSE unresponsiveness to one or more second-line AEDs may require treatment with IV anesthesia to terminate seizures and prevent neuronal injury and other complications. The IV anesthetic is increased to a level that induces deep coma and is maintained at that rate for 24 hours or more. SE that recurs following an attempted wean of IV anesthesia is classified as super refractory status epilepticus (SRSE). In April 2016, we were granted FDA orphan drug designation for the IV formulation of ganaxolone for the treatment of SE, which includes RSE. In January 2021, we enrolled the first patient in the RAISE trial, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in patients with RSE, who have failed two or more antiseizure medications. The RAISE trial has approximately 70 trial sites, primarily in the U.S. and Canada. It was designed to enroll approximately 124 patients who were randomized to receive ganaxolone or placebo added to standard of care. We reached alignment with the FDA on a protocol amendment, including a proposal for an interim analysis when two-thirds of the patients (approximately 82) had completed assessment of the primary and key secondary trial endpoints. The enrollment target for the interim analysis was completed in the first quarter of 2024. On April 15, 2024, we announced that the trial did not meet the pre-defined interim analysis stopping criteria on the co-primary endpoints. We decided to complete enrollment in the RAISE trial at 100 patients. On June 17, 2024, we announced top-line results, which showed that the trial met its first co-primary endpoint, with a statistically significant proportion of patients achieving SE cessation within 30 minutes of initiating IV ganaxolone compared to placebo: 80 vs. 13 , respectively (p

 To date, we have provided IV ganaxolone for treatment of SRSE in 34 patients under emergency IND applications. As a result of the TrustTSC outcome, we discontinued further ganaxolone clinical development, other than activities required by the FDA and EMA specific to post-approval commitments of Ztalmy for CDD, and have taken additional steps to reduce costs, including an approximate 45 reduction in our workforce in the fourth quarter of 2024. As a result, we are no longer accepting requests for SRSE emergency IND applications. We commenced a separate Phase 3 RSE trial to support an MAA in Europe (RAISE II) in 2023. In the second quarter of 2024, we decided to discontinue the RAISE II trial. On September 7, 2021, the USPTO granted us a patent (U.S. Patent No. 11,110,100) on a method of treating SE which includes claims related to our clinical therapeutic regimen for the treatment of SE using IV ganaxolone. This issued patent expires in 2040. That patent is a member of a patent family we own that includes pending patent applications that claim certain therapeutic regimens for the treatment of SE, including RSE, using intravenous ganaxolone. The USPTO granted us a second patent for SE on June 20, 2023 (U.S. Patent No.11,679,117) with claims that cover therapeutic regiments in which high doses of ganaxolone are administered, which we believe is relevant for some patients, and strengthens our intellectual property portfolio for the treatment of SE, including SRSE, using ganaxolone. In July 2022, the USPTO issued U.S. Patent No. 11,395,817 (Ovid 817 Patent) to Ovid Therapeutics, Inc. (Ovid) with claims that may encompass our product candidate for the treatment of SE. On March 15, 2023, we filed a petition seeking post-grant review (PGR) of the Ovid 817 Patent with the USPTO Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB). Our petition for PGR argued that the claims of the Ovid 817 Patent are unpatentable on multiple grounds. Ovid filed a preliminary response to our petition on June 20, 2023. In Ovid s reply to our request for PGR, Ovid disclaimed claims 1-21, 23 and 24 of the Ovid 817 Patent, which has the effect of erasing these claims from the patent, irrespective of the outcome of the PGR. On August 17, 2023, the PTAB issued a decision granting institution of our petition seeking PGR of the Ovid 817 Patent. In instituting the PGR, the PTAB stated that it was more likely than not that we would be able to invalidate the remaining claims (22 and 25-31) of the Ovid 817 Patent during the proceeding. On August 1, 2024, the PTAB issued its final written decision on the PGR Marinus Pharms., Inc. v. Ovid Therapeutics, Inc. , PGR2023-00020, Paper 41 (Aug. 1, 2024)), concluding that all remaining claims claims 22 and 25-31 were unpatentable as obvious. The decision is publicly available on the Patent Office s website (PTAB Open Data (uspto.gov) ). This decision was not appealed by Ovid within the appeal period. As a result of the PTAB decision, the Ovid patent 817 is invalid and cannot be asserted against Marinus in any future proceeding. On March 24, 2024, Ovid filed an Inter Partes Review (IPR) challenge of one of our patents for the use of ganaxolone in treating SE and RSE (U.S. Patent No. 11,110,100). We filed our preliminary response to the IPR on June 26, 2024. Following our response, the PTAB had 3 months to determine whether or not to institute the Ovid IPR. On September 20, 2024, the PTAB issued a decision denying institution of the IPR, stating that Ovid had not established a reasonable likelihood that it would prevail in showing the unpatentability of at least one claim challenged in the petition. Ovid did not choose to file for rehearing or seek director review at the PTAB within 30 days from the September 20, 2024 PTAB decision date. As a result, the decision of the PTAB denying institution of the IPR is final. Ovid cannot appeal the denial of institution to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. Operations Our operations to date have consisted primarily of organizing and staffing our company, developing ganaxolone, including conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials, raising capital, partnering ZTALMY in certain geographies and the early commercialization of ZTALMY. We have funded our operations primarily through sales of equity and debt securities. We recorded 8.5 million and 23.9 million of ZTALMY net sales in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. We recorded 5.4 million and 13.0 million of ZTAMLY net sales in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. Since inception, we have incurred negative cash flows from our operations, and other than for the three months ended September 30, 2022 due to a one-time net gain from the sale of our PRV, we have incurred net losses. We have generated limited product revenues, and there is no assurance that profitable operations will be achieved in the future, and if achieved, could be sustained on a continuing basis. We incurred Net losses of 24.2 million and 98.7 million for the three and nine months ended September 30,

 2024, respectively. We incurred Net losses of 33.0 million and 99.6 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. Our accumulated deficit as of September 30, 2024 was 670.6 million. We anticipate that we will continue to incur substantial losses in future periods as we: maintain sales, marketing and distribution capabilities to continue to commercialize ganaxolone; conduct other preclinical studies and clinical trials to support required FDA and EMA post-marketing requirements for the CDD indication; and maintain and protect our global intellectual property portfolio; and 
 continue and complete a process to explore strategic alternatives with the goal of maximizing value for our stockholders. 
 We had Cash and cash equivalents of 42.2 million as of September 30, 2024. We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents as of September 30, 2024 will be sufficient to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements into the second quarter of 2025. This expectation includes cost reduction activities that were implemented in the second and fourth quarters of 2024. As a result of the TrustTSC outcome, we discontinued further ganaxolone clinical development, other than activities required by the FDA and EMA specific to post-approval commitments of Ztalmy for CDD, and have taken additional steps to reduce costs, including an approximate 45 reduction in our workforce in the fourth quarter of 2024. We also commenced a process to explore strategic alternatives with the goal of maximizing value for our stockholders and engaged Barclays as an advisor to assist in our review of strategic alternatives. There can be no assurance that the exploration of strategic alternatives will result in any agreements or transactions, or as to the timing of any such agreements or transactions. We will need to secure additional funding in the future, from one or more equity or debt financings, government funding, collaborations, licensing transactions, other commercial transactions or other sources in order to carry out all of our commercialization activities with respect to ganaxolone. Financial Overview Product Revenue, net Our first FDA approved product, ZTALMY, became available for commercial sale and shipment in the third quarter of 2022. We have three customers, one of which, Orsini, a specialty pharmacy that dispenses ZTALMY directly to patients, represents approximately 98 of our ZTALMY revenue to date. Our contract with Orsini has a single performance obligation to deliver ZTALMY upon receipt of a purchase order, which is satisfied when Orsini receives ZTALMY. We recognize ZTALMY revenue at the point in time when control of ZTALMY is transferred to Orsini, which is upon delivery to Orsini. The transaction price that we recognize for ZTALMY revenue includes an estimate of variable consideration. Shipping and handling costs to Orsini are recorded as selling, general and administrative expenses. The components of variable consideration include: Trade Discounts and Allowances. We provide contractual discounts, including incentive prompt payment discounts and chargebacks. Each of these potential discounts are recorded as a reduction of ZTALMY revenue and accounts receivable in the period in which the related ZTALMY revenue is recognized. We estimate the amount of variable consideration for discounts and allowances using the expected value method. Product Returns and Recall. We provide for ZTALMY returns in accordance with our Return Good Policy. We estimate the amount of ZTALMY that may be returned using the expected value method, and we present this amount as a reduction of ZTALMY revenue in the period the related ZTALMY revenue is recognized. In the event of a recall, we will promptly notify Orsini and will reimburse Orsini for direct administrative expenses incurred in connection with the recall as well as the cost of replacement product.

 Government Rebates. We are subject to discount obligations under state Medicaid programs, Medicare, and the Tricare Retail Refund Program. We estimate reserves related to these discount programs and record these obligations in the same period the related Product revenue is recognized, resulting in a reduction of Product revenue. Patient Assistance . We offer a voluntary co-pay patient assistance program intended to provide financial assistance to eligible patients with a prescription drug co-payment required by payors and coupon programs for cash payors. The calculation of the current liability for this assistance is based on an estimate of claims and the cost per claim that we expect to receive associated with ZTALMY that has been recognized as Product revenue but remains in the distribution channel inventories at the end of each reporting period. Federal Contract Revenue In September 2020, we entered into a contract (BARDA Contract) with the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), a division of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response. Under the BARDA Contract, we receive d an award of up to an estimated 51 million for development of IV-administered ganaxolone for the treatment of RSE. The BARDA Contract provides for funding to support, on a cost-sharing basis, the completion of a Phase 3 clinical trial of IV-administered ganaxolone in patients with RSE, which covers the RAISE trial, funding of preclinical studies to evaluate IV-administered ganaxolone as an effective treatment for RSE due to chemical nerve gas agent exposure, and funding of certain ganaxolone manufacturing scale-up and regulatory activities. In March 2022, we entered into an amendment with BARDA to extend the end date of our base performance period for funding under the BARDA Contract from September 1, 2022 to December 31, 2023. In September 2022, we entered into an amendment with BARDA that, among other things, (i) provides for the exercise of BARDA s option under the BARDA Contract to support U.S. onshoring of the manufacturing capabilities for ganaxolone API (Option 2), (ii) changes the end date of our performance period under Option 2 from December 31, 2026 to July 31, 2025, (iii) increases the government cost share amount under Option 2 from approximately 11.5 million to approximately 12.3 million, and (iv) increases our cost share amount under Option 2 from approximately 4.9 million to approximately 5.3 million. In September 2023, we entered into an amendment with BARDA to extend the end date of our base performance period for funding under the BARDA Contract from December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024. The BARDA Contract consists of an approximately four-year base period, including the extension periods, during which BARDA agreed to provide up to approximately 21 million of funding for the RAISE trial on a cost share basis and funding of additional preclinical studies of ganaxolone in nerve agent exposure models. As of December 31, 2023, the entire base period funding of approximately 21 million had been recorded. Following successful completion of the RAISE trial and preclinical studies in the contract period, the BARDA Contract provides for approximately 31 million of additional BARDA funding for three options in support of ganaxolone manufacturing, supply chain, clinical, regulatory and toxicology activities, including the 12.3 million exercise of Option 2 as described above. Under the BARDA Contract, we will be responsible for cost sharing in the amount of approximately 33 million and BARDA will be responsible for approximately 52 million if all development options are completed. The contract period-of-performance (base period plus option exercises) is up to approximately five years. We recognize Federal contract revenue from the BARDA Contract in the period in which the allowable research and development expenses are incurred. We expect Federal contract revenue to decrease as the entire base period funding of approximately 21 million had been recorded as of December 31, 2023. As such, funding is currently limited to Option 2, which supports onshoring of the manufacturing capabilities for ganaxolone API. Collaboration Revenue In July 2021, we entered into a collaboration agreement (Orion Collaboration Agreement) with Orion. Under the terms of the Orion Collaboration Agreement, we granted Orion an exclusive, royalty-bearing, sublicensable license to certain of our intellectual property rights with respect to commercializing biopharmaceutical products incorporating ganaxolone (Licensed Products) in the European Economic Area, the United Kingdom and Switzerland (collectively, the Territory) for the diagnosis, prevention and treatment of certain human diseases, disorders or conditions (Field), initially in the indications of CDD, TSC and RSE.

 Under the terms of the Orion Collaboration Agreement, we received a 25.0 million 29.6 million at then-existing exchange rate) upfront payment from Orion in July 2021. We are eligible to receive up to an additional 97 million in R D reimbursement and cash milestone payments based on specific clinical and commercial achievements. Also, as part of the overall arrangement, we have agreed to supply the Licensed Products to Orion at an agreed upon price. We identified the following commitments under the arrangement: (i) exclusive rights to develop, use, sell, have sold, offer for sale and import any product comprised of Licensed Product (License); (ii) development and regulatory activities (Development and Regulatory Activities); and (iii) requirement to supply Orion with the Licensed Product at an agreed upon price (Supply of Licensed Product). We determined that these three commitments represent distinct performance obligations for purposes of recognizing revenue and will recognize license and collaboration revenue or a reduction of expense as we fulfill each performance obligation. On November 16, 2022, we entered into a Collaboration and Supply Agreement (Tenacia Collaboration Agreement) with Tenacia Biotechnology (Shanghai) Co., Ltd. (Tenacia). Under the terms of the Tenacia Collaboration Agreement, we granted Tenacia an exclusive, royalty-bearing, sublicensable license to certain of our intellectual property rights to develop, commercialize and otherwise exploit certain products incorporating certain oral and intravenous formulations of the our product candidate ganaxolone (Licensed Products) in Mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan (collectively, Territory) for the diagnosis, prevention and treatment of certain human diseases, disorders or conditions (Field), initially for the treatment of CDD, TSC and SE (including RSE) (collectively, Initial Indications). The collaboration can be expanded to include additional indications and formulations of ganaxolone pursuant to a right of first negotiation. Under the terms of the Tenacia Collaboration Agreement, Tenacia agreed to pay us an upfront cash payment of 10 million (Upfront Fee) within forty-five (45) days after the Effective Date, which was received in December 2022. In addition to the Upfront Fee, Tenacia has agreed to make cash payments to us upon the achievement of certain development, regulatory and sales-based milestones related to (i) the Initial Indications and (ii) the first new formulation or pro-drug of ganaxolone or any back-up compound of ganaxolone in a new indication (Selected Product) for which the parties amend the Tenacia Collaboration Agreement in connection with Tenacia s exercise of its right of first negotiation and for which there is no other Licensed Product approved in China (for clarity, the milestone payments under this clause (ii) will only apply to one Selected Product), up to an aggregate amount of 256 million. Of the milestones, 15 million relates to regulatory approvals with separate milestones related to each of oral and intravenous formulations and the Selected Product, and an aggregate of 241 million of sales-based milestones are connected to annual revenue thresholds specific to each of the oral, intravenous and Selected Product formulations of ganaxolone. Tenacia has further agreed to pay us tiered royalty payments based on annual net sales of Licensed Products ranging from the low double digits to the mid-teens for each of the oral formulation, intravenous formulation and Selected Product formulation of Licensed Products. Tenacia s obligations to pay royalties to us with respect to sales of a Licensed Product in each particular jurisdiction of the Territory will commence on the date of first commercial sale in such jurisdiction and expire upon the latest of (i) ten years following the first commercial sale of such Licensed Product in such jurisdiction, (ii) the expiration of the last-to-expire valid claim of any licensed patent rights that covers such Licensed Product in such jurisdiction and (iii) the expiration of all regulatory exclusivities for such Licensed Product in such jurisdiction. Royalty payments are subject to reduction in specified circumstances as set forth in the Tenacia Collaboration Agreement, including if net sales decrease by a certain percentage after the introduction of a generic product. Tenacia will be primarily responsible for the development of Licensed Products in the Territory and regulatory interactions related thereto, including conducting and sponsoring clinical studies in the Field in the Territory to support regulatory filings in the Territory. All regulatory approvals filed by Tenacia in the Territory will be in the name of and owned by us unless otherwise required by applicable law, in which case such regulatory approvals would be in the name of and owned by Tenacia for the benefit of us. We and Tenacia agreed to enter into clinical and commercial supply agreements pursuant to which we will supply Tenacia with its requirements of Licensed Products necessary for Tenacia to develop and commercialize Licensed Products in the Field in the Territory. The parties entered into one such clinical and commercial supply agreement in May 2023. The agreement contains pricing, delivery, acceptance, payment, termination, forecasting, and other terms consistent with the Tenacia Collaboration Agreement, as well as certain quality assurance, indemnification, liability and other standard industry terms. Tenacia will be responsible for, at Tenacia s sole

 cost and expense, obtaining regulatory approval and commercializing the Licensed Product in the Field in Mainland China. Tenacia enrolled patients in our Phase 3 randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled trial (TrustTSC trial) of adjunctive ganaxolone. The term of the Tenacia Collaboration Agreement extends for so long as royalties are payable anywhere in the Territory. Subject to the terms of the Tenacia Collaboration Agreement, (i) for a specified period of time after the Effective Date, Tenacia may terminate the Tenacia Collaboration Agreement in its entirety for any or no reason upon written notice to us, and (ii) either party may terminate the Tenacia Collaboration Agreement for the other party s material breach following a cure period or insolvency. In accordance with the guidance, we identified the following commitments under the arrangement: (i) grant to Tenacia the exclusive rights to develop, commercialize and otherwise exploit Licensed Product in the Field in the Territory (License) and (ii) requirement to supply Tenacia with the Licensed Product at an agreed upon price (Supply of Licensed Product). We determined that these two commitments represent distinct performance obligations for purposes of recognizing revenue or reducing expense, which we will recognize such revenue or expense, as applicable, as we fulfill these performance obligations. We have also entered into agreements for commercialization of ganaxolone in other territories with (i) NovaMedica LLC (NovaMedica), whereby NovaMedica has the right to market and sell ganaxolone in Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, Russia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Ukraine and Uzbekistan, and (ii) Biologix FZCo (Biologix), whereby Biologix has the right to distribute and sell ganaxolone in Algeria, Bahrain, Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Lebanon, Libya, Morocco, Oman, Qatar, Tunisia and United Arab Emirates. In exchange for these rights, we will be the exclusive supplier of our products to NovaMedica and Biologix on terms set forth in the respective agreements in exchange for a negotiated purchase price for the products. As of the first quarter of 2023, we had initiated limited sales of ZTALMY to NovaMedica to support on-going early access programs associated with patients from the Marigold Trial. We are in the process of initiating a global managed access program with Uniphar Durbin Ireland LTD to support physician access to ZTALMY for appropriate patients with seizures associated with CDD in geographies where there is no available patient access, local regulatory criteria and program eligibility are satisfied, and we do not already have a commercial distribution relationship in place. We continue to assess opportunities in other markets to further expand the distribution and commercialization of ganaxolone globally. Research and Development Expenses Our research and development expenses consist primarily of costs incurred for the development of ganaxolone, which include: employee-related expenses, including salaries, benefits, travel and stock-based compensation expense; expenses incurred under agreements with clinical research organizations (CROs) and investigative sites that conduct our clinical trials and preclinical studies; the cost of acquiring, developing and manufacturing clinical trial materials; facilities, depreciation and other expenses, which include direct and allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities, enterprise technology, and other supplies; costs associated with preclinical activities and regulatory operations; and costs associated with developing new formulations and prodrugs of ganaxolone.

 We expense research and development costs when we incur them. We record costs for some development activities, such as clinical trials, based on an evaluation of the progress to completion of specific tasks using data such as patient enrollment, clinical site activations and information our vendors provide to us. We have incurred substantial costs beyond our clinical trials in order to file an NDA and Supplemental NDAs, or MAAs outside the U.S., for ganaxolone for various clinical indications, and in each case, the nature, design, size and cost of further clinical trials and other studies have depended in large part on the outcome of preceding studies and trials and discussions with regulators. It is difficult to determine with certainty the costs and duration of clinical trials and preclinical studies, or if, when or to what extent we will generate revenue from the commercialization and sale of ganaxolone if we obtain regulatory approval in other indications. We may never succeed in achieving regulatory approval for ganaxolone in other indications and, if approved, we may not be successful in commercialization of ganaxolone in other indications. In addition, the probability of success for our clinical programs has depended on numerous factors, including competition, manufacturing capability and commercial viability. See the Risk Factors section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed on March 5, 2024 for more information with respect to such factors. Our continued commercial success depends upon attaining significant market acceptance, if approved, among physicians, patients, healthcare payers and the medical community. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses consist principally of salaries and related costs for executive, commercial and other administrative personnel and consultants, including stock-based compensation and travel expenses. Other Selling, general and administrative expenses include professional fees for commercial, legal, patent review, consulting and accounting services. Selling, general and administrative expenses are expensed when incurred. Restructuring Costs Restructuring costs primarily consist of severance payments, employee benefits and related costs, as well as noncash stock compensation expense and contract termination costs. Restructuring costs are expensed when incurred. Cost of Product Revenue Cost of product revenue includes the cost of inventory sold, which includes direct manufacturing and supply chain costs. Also included in Cost of product revenue are royalty payments owed to Purdue Neuroscience Company (Purdue) and Ovid in accordance with the respective license agreements. We began capitalizing Inventory related to ZTALMY subsequent to the March 2022 FDA approval of ZTALMY, as the related costs were expected to be recoverable through the commercialization and subsequent sale of ZTALMY. Prior to FDA approval of ZTALMY, costs estimated at approximately 2.0 million for commercially saleable product and materials were incurred and included in Research and development expenses. As a result, Cost of product revenues related to ZTALMY initially reflected a lower average per unit cost of materials, and continued to do so into the second quarter of 2024, as previously expensed inventory was utilized for commercial production and sold to customers. We expect Cost of product revenues related to ZTALMY to begin to reflect the current on-going average per unit cost of materials for the remainder of 2024 and thereafter. Interest Income Interest income consists principally of interest earned on Cash and cash equivalents and Short-term investments balances. Interest Expense Interest expense consists of interest expense and amortization of debt discount related to our Notes Payable and our Revenue Interest Financing Payable.

 Other Income, net Other income and expense consist principally of non-operational transactions, including research and development tax credits, gains or losses on disposal of fixed assets held for sale, foreign currency transactions, and fair value adjustments. Results of Operations Product Revenue, net We recognized 8.5 million and 5.4 million of ZTALMY net product revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. We recognized 23.9 million and 13.0 million of ZTALMY net product revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. The increases in the both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the 2023 periods were primarily due to an increase in patients in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as ZTALMY had only recently become available for commercial sale and shipment in the comparable 2023 periods. Federal Contract Revenue We recognized 0.1 million and 1.9 million of federal contract revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively, as a result of the BARDA Contract. We recognized 0.3 million and 10.8 million of federal contract revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively, as a result of the BARDA Contract. The decreases in both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the 2023 periods primarily related to expenses incurred in connection with validation of a new third-party supplier of ganaxolone API in the 2023 periods, and no revenue related to the base period funding in 2024. As of December 31, 2023, the entire base period funding had been recorded, resulting in no revenue for the base period funding in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. Collaboration Revenue Collaboration revenue, which resulted from our agreement with Biologix, was less than 0.1 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023.

 Research and Development Expenses We record direct Research and development expenses, consisting principally of external costs, such as fees paid to investigators, consultants, central laboratories and CROs in connection with our clinical trials, and costs related to manufacturing, to specific product development programs. We do not allocate costs related to purchasing clinical trial materials, employee and contractor-related costs, costs associated with our facility expenses, including depreciation or other indirect costs, to specific product programs because these costs are deployed across multiple product programs under research and development and, as such, are not separately classified. The table below shows our research and development expenses incurred with respect to each active program. The primary drivers of our Research and development expenditures are currently in our product development programs for CDD, RSE, and TSC. We did not allocate research and development expenses to any other specific product development programs during the periods presented (in thousands):

The decrease in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the 2023 period was due to decreased phase 3 clinical trial activity in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the 2023 period, as well as increased activity associated with the MAA application and review in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 with no comparable costs in the 2024 period. These decreases were partially offset by increases in PIP clinical trial activity in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 with no comparable costs in the 2023 period. (2) Costs remained relatively consistent and were immaterial in each of the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the 2023 periods. (3) The decrease in both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the 2023 periods were due primarily to increased global site activity in the 2023 periods which was partially offset by increased Phase 3 TSC trial activity in the 2024 periods. (4) The increases in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the 2023 periods were due primarily to higher manufacturing development activity related to clinical trial batches than in the prior 2023 periods.

Table of Contents 
 (5) The decrease in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the 2023 period was primarily due to decreased clinical trial activity in the three months ended September 30, 2024. The increase in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the 2023 period was primarily due to increased RAISE and RAISE II trial and close out activities in the 2024 period. (6) The decreases in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the 2023 periods were due primarily to the start-up costs associated with validation of a new third-party U.S. supplier of ganaxolone API in the 2023 periods. (7) The decrease in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the 2023 period was due primarily to decreases in safety study activity. The increase in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the 2023 period was due primarily to an increase in post-marketing studies. Other research and development expenses include external expenses associated with preclinical development of ganaxolone, including safety studies, stability studies, preclinical studies, including animal toxicology and pharmacology studies and studies related to post-marketing commitments, and other professional fees. (8) The decreases in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the 2023 periods were primarily related to decreases in personnel costs, which were partially offset by increases in costs related to software. Indirect research and development expenses include personnel costs and non-study specific research and development costs. 
 Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses were 12.6 million and 47.9 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. Selling, general and administrative expenses were 14.9 million and 45.8 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The primary drivers of the decrease for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the 2023 period were 2.1 million in decreased personnel costs, 0.6 million in decreased consulting fees, 0.4 million in decreased professional fees and other general costs, and 0.2 million in decreased software related expenses, which were partially offset by 1.0 million in increased stock-based compensation costs. The primary drivers of the increase for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the 2023 period were 2.7 in increased stock-based compensation costs, 2.1 million in increased commercial costs, and 1.0 million in increased professional fees and other general costs, which were partially offset by 1.8 million in decreased personnel costs, 1.1 million in decreased consulting costs, and 0.8 million in software related expenses.

 Restructuring Costs Restructuring costs were approximately 2.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, with no comparable costs in 2023, and primarily consisted of severance payments, employee benefits and related costs, as well as noncash stock compensation expense and contract termination costs. There were no restructuring costs in the three months ended September 30, 2024. Cost of Product Revenue Cost of product revenue was 0.7 million and 2.2 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 0.5 million and 1.0 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The increases were due primarily to Cost of product revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 beginning to reflect the current on-going average per unit cost of materials. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, Cost of product revenues related to ZTALMY reflected a lower average per unit cost of materials, as prior to FDA approval of ZTALMY, costs estimated at approximately 2.0 million for commercially saleable product and materials were incurred and included in Research and development expenses. We expect ongoing Cost of product revenues related to ZTALMY to continue to reflect the on-going average per unit cost of materials throughout the remainder of 2024 and thereafter. Interest Income Interest income was 0.6 million and 3.2 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to 1.9 million and 6.4 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, and consisted of interest earned on Cash and cash equivalents and Short-term investments. The decreases were due to a decrease in Cash and cash equivalent and Short-term investments in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. Interest Expense Interest expense was 3.8 million and 12.8 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to 4.2 million and 12.6 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. Interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 included 6.3 million of interest paid and 1.5 million of debt amortization in connection with our Note Payable (Note 10 in accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements), and 4.5 million of non-cash interest expense and 0.4 million of debt amortization related to our Revenue interest financing payable (Note 11 in accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements). Interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 included 6.5 million of interest paid and 1.5 million of debt amortization in connection with our Note Payable, and 4.4 million of non-cash interest expense and 0.2 million of debt amortization related to our Revenue interest financing payable, Other Income, net Other income, net was 0.1 million for each of the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 due primarily to a research and development tax credit. Other income, net was 1.0 million and 1.1 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, primarily due to the IRS Employee Retention Tax Credit program. Other income, net consists principally of other non-operational transactions, including research and development tax credits, gains or losses on disposal of fixed assets held for sale, foreign currency transactions, and fair value adjustments.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources Since inception, we have incurred negative cash flows from our operations, and other than for the three months ended September 30, 2022 due to a one-time net gain from the sale of our PRV, we have incurred net losses. We incurred a Net loss of 98.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Our Cash used in operating activities was 87.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 91.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Historically, we have financed our operations principally through the sale of common stock, notes payable, preferred stock and convertible debt. In August 2022, we received a letter from Purdue in which Purdue claimed that it was owed 5.5 million by us from the sale of the PRV pursuant to the Purdue License Agreement. We responded to Purdue that we did not agree with their claim. In February 2024, following discussions with Purdue, we agreed to pay Purdue 4.0 million in respect of its claim. We paid the first installment of 2.0 million in March 2024 and the second installment of 2.0 million in June 2024. In September 2023, in connection with the amended Equity Distribution Agreement (EDA) with JMP Securities LLC (JMP), we received net proceeds totaling approximately 25.9 million from the sale of 3.7 million shares of our common stock at an average price of 7.17 per share. As of September 30, 2024, we had Cash and cash equivalents 42.2 million. We did not have any Short-term investments as of September 30, 2024. We believe that our existing Cash and cash equivalents as of September 30, 2024 will be sufficient to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements into the second quarter of 2025. This expectation includes cost reduction activities that were implemented in the second and fourth quarters of 2024. Oaktree Credit Agreement On May 11, 2021 (Closing Date) and as amended on May 17, 2021, May 23, 2022, October 28, 2022 and June 6, 2024 (Credit Agreement), we entered into the Credit Agreement with Oaktree Fund Administration, LLC as administrative agent (Oaktree) and the lenders party thereto (collectively, Lenders) that provided for a five-year senior secured term loan facility in an aggregate original principal amount of up to 125.0 million that was available to us in five tranches (collectively, Term Loans). As of September 30, 2024, we had drawn on three tranches with no additional funds available thereunder. We received 15.0 million of Tranche A-1 Term Loans on the Closing Date, 30.0 million of Tranche A-2 Term Loans in September 2021 after formal acceptance by the FDA of an NDA filing relating to the use of ganaxolone in the treatment of CDD, and 30.0 million of Tranche B Term Loans in March 2022 after FDA approval of ZTALMY for CDD. In connection with the second amendment to the Credit Agreement, we prepaid 15.0 million of the Tranche B Term Loans in June 2024 as well as the associated prepayment penalties, exit fee and accrued interest. Additionally, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we began paying the required quarterly principal payments. As of September 30, 2024, the loans under the Credit Agreement consisted of 58.1 million of previously drawn Term Loans with no additional funds available thereunder. The Term Loans mature on May 11, 2026 (Maturity Date). The Term Loans bear interest at a fixed per annum rate (subject to increase during an event of default) of 11.50 , and we are required to make quarterly interest payments until the Maturity Date. We began making quarterly principal payments beginning on June 30, 2024 in an amount equal to 2.5 of the aggregate amount of the previously drawn Term Loans, and continuing until 2025, at which time we are required to make quarterly principal payments in an amount equal to 5.0 of the aggregate amount of the previously drawn Term Loans until the Maturity Date. On the Maturity Date, we are required to pay in full all outstanding Term Loans and other amounts owed under the Credit Agreement. At the time of borrowing any tranche of the Term Loans, we were required to pay an upfront fee of 2.0 of the aggregate principal amount borrowed at that time.

 In connection with the Revenue Interest Financing Agreement with Sagard as described below, on October 28, 2022, we entered into an amendment to the Credit Agreement to, among other things, allow for the consummation of the Revenue Interest Financing Agreement and the transactions thereunder, and paid 0.3 million in administrative fees in connection with the execution of the amendment. In addition, the amendment increased the exit fee due by us upon any repayment, whether as a prepayment or a scheduled repayment, of the principal of the loans under the Credit Agreement from 2.00 to 2.67 . Sagard Financing Agreement In October 2022, we entered into a revenue interest financing agreement (the Revenue Interest Financing Agreement) with Sagard Healthcare Royalty Partners, LP (Sagard) pursuant to which we received 32.5 million. In exchange for the Investment Amount, we agreed to make quarterly payments to Sagard (Payments) as follows: (i) for each calendar quarter from and after the closing date of such financing through and including the quarter ended June 30, 2026, an amount equal to 7.5 of (a) our U.S. net sales of ZTALMY and all other pharmaceutical products that contain ganaxolone (Net Sales), in each case with any dosage form, dosing regimen, or strength, or any improvements related thereto (collectively, Included Products) and (b) certain other payments received by us in connection with the manufacture, development and sale of the Included Products in the U.S. (Other Included Payments, and, together with Net Sales, Product Revenue); and (ii) for each calendar quarter following the calendar quarter ended June 30, 2026, an amount equal to (x) 15.0 of the first 100 million in annual Product Revenue of the Included Products and (y) 7.5 of annual Product Revenue of the Included Products in excess of 100 million. The Payments are subject to a hard cap equal to 190 61.8 million) of the Investment Amount (Hard Cap). Sagard s right to receive payments will terminate when Sagard has received payments in respect of the Included Products, including any additional payments described below, equal to the Hard Cap. Further, we have the right to make voluntary prepayments to Sagard, and such payments will be credited against the Hard Cap. If Sagard has not received aggregate payments equaling at least 100 of the Investment Amount by December 31, 2027 or at least 190 of the Investment Amount by December 31, 2032 (each, Minimum Amount), then we will be obligated to make a cash payment to Sagard in an amount sufficient to gross up Sagard up to the applicable Minimum Amount within a specified period of time after each reference date. BARDA Contract In September 2020, we entered into a contract (BARDA Contract) with the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), a division of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response. Under the BARDA Contract, we received an award of up to an estimated 51 million for development of IV-administered ganaxolone for the treatment of RSE. The BARDA Contract provides for funding to support, on a cost-sharing basis, the completion of a Phase 3 clinical trial of IV-administered ganaxolone in patients with RSE, which covers the RAISE trial, funding of preclinical studies to evaluate IV-administered ganaxolone as an effective treatment for RSE due to chemical nerve gas agent exposure, and funding of certain ganaxolone manufacturing scale-up and regulatory activities. In March 2022, we entered into an amendment with BARDA to extend the end date of our base performance period for funding under the BARDA Contract from September 1, 2022 to December 31, 2023. In September 2022, we entered into an amendment with BARDA that, among other things, (i) provides for the exercise of BARDA s option under the BARDA Contract to support U.S. onshoring of the manufacturing capabilities for ganaxolone API (Option 2), (ii) changes the end date of our performance period under Option 2 from December 31, 2026 to July 31, 2025, (iii) increases the government cost share amount under Option 2 from approximately 11.5 million to approximately 12.3 million, and (iv) increases our cost share amount under Option 2 from approximately 4.9 million to approximately 5.3 million. In September 2023, we entered into an amendment with BARDA to extend the end date of our base performance period for funding under the BARDA Contract from December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024.

Table of Contents 
 The BARDA Contract consists of an approximately four-year base period, including the extension periods, during which BARDA agreed to provide up to approximately 21 million of funding for the RAISE trial on a cost share basis and funding of additional preclinical studies of ganaxolone in nerve agent exposure models. As of December 31, 2023, the entire base period funding of approximately 21 million had been recorded. Following successful completion of the RAISE trial and preclinical studies in the base period and extension periods, the BARDA Contract provides for approximately 31 million of additional BARDA funding for three options in support of ganaxolone manufacturing, supply chain, clinical, regulatory and toxicology activities, including the 12.3 million exercise of Option 2 as described above. Under the BARDA Contract, we will be responsible for cost sharing in the amount of approximately 33 million and BARDA will be responsible for approximately 52 million if all development options are completed. The contract period-of-performance (base period plus option exercises) is up to approximately five years. Equity Financings In connection with the closing of an equity financing in November 2022 and the December 2022 exercise of the related underwriters option, we issued a total of 12,421,053 shares of common stock and 2,105,264 pre-funded warrants to purchase common stock in an underwritten public offering resulting in aggregate net proceeds of 64.5 million, after deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses paid or payable by us. Equity Distribution Agreement On July 9, 2020, we entered into an Equity Distribution Agreement (EDA) with JMP Securities LLC (JMP), as amended by the March 31, 2023 Amendment No. 1 to the EDA (Amended EDA), to create an at the market equity program under which we from time to time may offer and sell shares of our common stock without a specified maximum aggregate offering price. The Amended EDA was entered into in connection with our filing of a Registration Statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-271041) with the SEC (the 2023 Registration Statement), which includes a prospectus supplement covering the offering, issuance and sale by us of up to 75,000,000 of shares of common stock that may be issued and sold under the Amended EDA. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Amended EDA, JMP will be entitled to a commission of up to 3.0 of the gross proceeds from each sale of shares of our common stock. We did not sell any shares of our common stock during each of the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 under the EDA. As of September 30, 2024, we had up to 48.6 million of shares of common stock that may be issued and sold under the Amended EDA. Cash Flows Operating Activities. Cash used in operating activities was 87.8 million and 91.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Excluding the noncash impacts primarily related to depreciation and amortization, debt issuance costs, interest accretion net of cash paid, stock-based compensation, and changes in the net contract assets/liabilities related to the Orion, Tenacia and Biologix Collaboration Agreements, the change in cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023, was primarily the result of decreases in the changes in accounts payable, accrued expenses, including the 4.0 million installment to be paid to Purdue, other long term-liabilities, prepaid expenses, other current assets, inventory and accounts receivable and a decrease in operating expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the 2023 period, which was due primarily to a decrease in personnel costs related to our reduction-in-force (RIF) in the second quarter of 2024 which impacted approximately 20 of our workforce. Investing Activities. Cash provided by investing activities of 28.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 represents 29.9 million in maturities of Short-term investments, which was partially offset by 1.2 million in purchases of manufacturing equipment. Cash used in investing activities of 35.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily represents 52.0 million in purchases of Short-term investments, which was partially offset by 17.0 million in maturities of Short-term investments. Financing Activities. Cash used in financing activities of 19.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 represents 19.6 million in principal prepayments, including associated financing costs and exit fees, on our Long-term debt and 0.3 million in proceeds from the exercise of stock options. Cash provided by financing activities of 

 47 

Table of Contents 
 26.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 represents 25.9 million in net proceeds related to the sale of common stock in connection with the Amended EDA, and 0.8 million in proceeds from the exercise of stock options, which were partially offset by 0.7 million of other financing activities. Funding Requirements Since inception, we have incurred negative cash flows from our operations, and other than for the three months ended September 30, 2022 due to a one-time net gain from the sale of our PRV, we have incurred net losses. We incurred Net losses of 24.2 million and 98.7 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. We have generated limited product revenues, and there is no assurance that profitable operations will be achieved in the future, and if achieved, could be sustained on a continuing basis. We had Cash and cash equivalents of 42.2 million as of September 30, 2024. We believe that our existing Cash and cash equivalents as of September 30, 2024 will be sufficient to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements into the second quarter of 2025. This expectation includes cost reduction activities that were implemented in the second and fourth quarters of 2024. As a result of the TrustTSC outcome, we discontinued further ganaxolone clinical development, other than activities required by the FDA and EMA specific to post-approval commitments of Ztalmy for CDD, and have taken additional steps to reduce costs, including an approximate 45 reduction in our workforce in the fourth quarter of 2024. We also commenced a process to explore strategic alternatives with the goal of maximizing value for our stockholders and engaged Barclays as an advisor to assist in our review of strategic alternatives. There can be no assurance that the exploration of strategic alternatives will result in any agreements or transactions, or as to the timing of any such agreements or transactions. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including: the results of our preclinical studies and clinical trials; the development, formulation and commercialization activities related to ganaxolone, including ZTALMY; 
 the timing of, and the costs involved in, obtaining regulatory approvals for ganaxolone, including ZTALMY in indications other than CDD in the U.S., EU, or other significant markets, and any other future product candidates in these markets; 
 the cost of commercialization activities for ZTALMY in CDD in the U.S., including marketing, sales and distribution costs; the cost of commercialization activities for ZTALMY, ganaxolone in any other indications, or any other future product candidates, are approved for sale, including marketing, sales and distribution costs; the cost of manufacturing and formulating ganaxolone, or any other future product candidates, to internal and regulatory standards for use in preclinical studies, clinical trials and, if approved, commercial sale; 
 our ability to establish and maintain strategic collaborations, licensing or other arrangements and the financial terms of such agreements; 
 our ability to receive funding under the BARDA Contract; 
 our expectations regarding the amount and timing of milestone and royalty payments owed to us pursuant to our collaboration and supply agreements with Orion for the commercialization of ganaxolone in Europe, our collaboration and supply agreements with Tenacia for the commercialization of ganaxolone in Mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan and our exclusive distribution and supply agreement with Biologix for the distribution and supply of ganaxolone in the Middle East and North Africa region;

 our expectations regarding the amount and timing of milestone and royalty payments owed by us pursuant to our Revenue Interest Financing Agreement with Sagard; 
 any product liability, infringement or other lawsuits related to ZTALMY or other indications being developed for ganaxolone and, if approved, products; capital needed to attract and retain skilled personnel; the timing and results of our strategic alternatives review; the costs involved in preparing, filing, prosecuting, maintaining, defending and enforcing patent claims, including litigation costs and the outcome of such litigation; and the timing, receipt and amount of sales of, or royalties on, ZTALMY in CDD and on future approved products, if any. 
 Please see the Risk Factors section included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the SEC on March 5, 2024 for additional risks associated with our substantial capital requirements. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors. Discussion of Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to use judgment in making certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses in our financial statements and accompanying notes. Critical accounting policies are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require difficult, subjective and complex judgments by management in order to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, there were no significant changes to our critical accounting policies from those described in our annual consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023, which we included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on March 5, 2024. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative D isclosures About Market Risk We are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act), and are not required to provide the information under this item . Item 4. Controls and Procedures (a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures . Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely

Table of Contents 
 decisions regarding required disclosures. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on such evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of September 30, 2024. (b) Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by Rule 13a-15(d) and 15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 PART II OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. Legal Proceedings From time to time, we may become subject to litigation and claims arising in the ordinary course of business. Other than as described below, we are not currently a party to any material legal proceedings, and we are not aware of any pending or threatened legal proceedings against us that we believe could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results or financial condition. On June 5, 2024, a securities class action lawsuit captioned Bishins v. Marinus Pharmaceuticals, Inc., et. al., Case 2:24-cv-02430, was filed against us and certain of our officers in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. The complaint alleges violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended Exchange Act), and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder on the basis of purportedly materially false and misleading statements and omissions concerning our RAISE and RAISE II clinical trials. The complaint seeks, among other things, unspecified damages, attorneys fees, expert fees, and other costs. The court appointed a lead plaintiff and lead counsel for the action on August 16, 2024. The lead plaintiff filed an amended complaint on October 4, 2024. We intend to move to dismiss the amended complaint on or before November 22, 2024. We intend to vigorously defend against this action. Item 1A. Risk Factors Other than as set forth below and previously disclosed in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, there have been no material changes to the risk factors previously disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023: Risks Related to our Compliance with Nasdaq Listing Requirements If our stock price continues to remain below 1.00 or our market value of listed securities remains below 50 million, or we fail to meet other listing requirements of the Nasdaq Stock Market, our common stock may be subject to delisting from the Nasdaq Stock Market, which would materially reduce the liquidity of our common stock and have an adverse effect on our market price. Our common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Global Market, and we are therefore subject to its continued listing requirements, including requirements with respect to the market value of publicly-held shares, market value of listed shares, minimum bid price per share, and minimum stockholders equity, among others, and requirements relating to board and committee independence. If we fail to satisfy one or more of the requirements, we may be delisted from the Nasdaq Global Market. Nasdaq Listing Rule 5450(a)(1) requires companies listed on the Nasdaq Global Market to maintain a minimum bid price of at least 1.00 per share. If the minimum bid price of our common stock remains below 1.00 per share for 30 consecutive business days, Nasdaq will send us a notice that we are not in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5450(a)(1). In accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), we would then have a period of 180 calendar days to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement. To regain compliance, the closing bid price of our common stock would have to meet or exceed 1.00 per share for at least ten consecutive business days during this 180 calendar day period. In the event we did not regain compliance by the end of such period, we could be eligible for an additional 180 calendar day grace period, provided that we submit an online transfer application to transfer the listing of our common stock to the Nasdaq Capital Market, submit an application fee, and meet the continued listing requirement for market value of publicly held shares and all other initial listing standards for the Nasdaq Capital Market, except the bid price requirement. In addition, we will be required to provide written notice of our intention to cure the deficiency during the second compliance period by effecting a reverse stock split if necessary. If it appears to Nasdaq that we would not be able to cure the deficiency during the second compliance period, or if we determined not to submit a transfer application or make the required representation, Nasdaq would provide written notice to us that our common stock would be subject 

 51 

Table of Contents 
 to delisting. In the event of such notification, we could appeal Nasdaq s determination to delist our securities, but there can be no assurance that Nasdaq would grant our request for continued listing. Additionally, Nasdaq Listing Rule 5450(b)(2) requires companies listed on the Nasdaq Global Market to maintain a total market value of listed securities of at least 50 million. If the total market value of our listed securities remains below 50 million for 30 consecutive business days, Nasdaq will send us a notice that we are not in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5450(b)(2). In accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(C), we would then have a period of 180 calendar days to regain compliance with the total market value of listed securities requirement. To regain compliance, the total market value of our listed securities would have to meet or exceed 50 million for at least ten consecutive business days during this 180 calendar day period. In the event we did not regain compliance by the end of such period, Nasdaq would provide written notice to us that our common stock would be subject to delisting. In the event of such notification, we could appeal Nasdaq s determination to delist our securities, but there can be no assurance that Nasdaq would grant our request for continued listing. We are actively monitoring our stock price and our market value of listed securities, and will consider any and all options available to us to maintain or, if necessary, regain compliance. There can be no assurance, however, that we will be able to maintain or, if necessary, regain compliance and meet Nasdaq s continued listing requirements. To the extent that we are unable to maintain or, if necessary, regain compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5450(a)(1) and Rule 5450(b)(2) or the other requirements of Nasdaq for continued listing, there is a risk that our common stock may be delisted from Nasdaq. Delisting from Nasdaq may limit the range and attractiveness of strategic alternatives that we are able to consider, adversely affect our ability to raise additional financing through the public or private sale of equity securities, significantly affect the ability of investors to trade our securities, or negatively affect the value and liquidity of our common stock. Delisting also could have other negative results, including the potential loss of employee confidence, the loss of institutional investors or interest in business development opportunities. If we are delisted from Nasdaq and we are not able to list our common stock on another exchange, our common stock may be eligible to trade on an over-the-counter system, such as the OTCQB market, where an investor may find it more difficult to sell our common stock or obtain accurate quotations as to the market value of our common stock. We cannot assure you that our common stock, if delisted from Nasdaq, will be listed on another national securities exchange or quoted on an over-the-counter quotation system. Risks Related to our Strategic Alternative Review We are in the process of evaluating strategic alternatives following the failure of TrustTSC to meet its primary endpoint, and we may need to pursue bankruptcy or dissolution if we are not able to identify and implement a meaningful strategic alternative in a timely manner. On October 24, 2024, we announced that TrustTSC did not meet the primary endpoint of percent change in 28-day TSC-associated seizure frequency. As a result of this, we discontinued further ganaxolone clinical development, other than activities required by the FDA and EMA specific to post-approval commitments of ZTALMY for CDD. Our existing cash and cash equivalents will not be sufficient to continue our operations as planned and, as a result, we have commenced a process to explore strategic alternatives with the goal of maximizing value for our stockholders, which may include the sale of the company, a strategic partnership with one or more parties, or the licensing, sale or divestiture of some or more of our assets, in addition to other alternatives. We have engaged Barclays to assist in reviewing our strategic alternatives. However, any strategic alternative that may be pursued and completed ultimately may not deliver the anticipated benefits or enhance shareholder value. There can be no guarantee that the process of evaluating strategic alternatives will result in our company entering into or completing a potential transaction, and we have not set a timetable for the completion of this review process. Should we be unable to identify and implement a meaningful strategic alternative in a timely manner, our Board of Directors is likely to consider seeking bankruptcy protection under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or engaging in a similar process. In that event we are required to liquidate under the federal bankruptcy laws, it is highly unlikely that our stockholders would receive any value for their shares.

 Our restructuring plans and the associated headcount reductions may not result in anticipated savings, could result in total costs and expenses that are greater than expected and could disrupt our business. On April 30, 2024, we implemented a reduction-in-force (RIF) that impacted approximately 20 of our workforce, and implemented additional cost reduction activities with impact beginning in the second quarter of 2024. On November 4, 2024, we implemented a separate RIF that impacted approximately 45 of our workforce, and implemented additional cost reduction activities with impact beginning in the fourth quarter of 2024, to reduce operating expenses and better align our workforce with the needs of our business following our discontinuance of further ganaxolone clinical development, other than activities required by the FDA and EMA specific to post-approval commitments of ZTALMY for CDD. Execution of the RIF is expected to be substantially completed by the end of 2024. As of the filing of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, in connection with the November 4, 2024 RIF, we estimate that we will incur in the fourth quarter of 2024 severance and other employee-related costs of approximately 1.5 million. We are also in the process of assessing any impact associated with the termination of certain contracts and all other activities under the November 4, 2024 RIF. We may undertake further restructuring actions or workforce reductions in the future. These types of restructuring and cost reduction activities are complex and may result in unintended consequences and costs, such as the loss of institutional knowledge and expertise, attrition beyond the intended number of employees, decreased morale among our remaining employees, and potential impacts on financial reporting. In addition, while positions have been eliminated, certain functions necessary to our operations remain, and we may be unsuccessful in retaining employees to perform such functions or in distributing the duties and obligations of departed employees among our remaining employees. These types of activities or losses could also make it difficult for us to pursue, or prevent us from pursuing, new opportunities and initiatives due to insufficient personnel, including any potential strategic alternatives. We may not realize, in full or in part, the anticipated benefits, savings and improvements in our cost structure from our restructuring efforts due to unforeseen difficulties, delays or unexpected costs. For example, we may incur unanticipated charges not currently contemplated as a result of the RIFs. If we are unable to realize the expected operational cost savings from the restructurings, our operating results and financial condition would be adversely affected. We may become involved in additional securities litigation that could further divert management s attention and harm our business, and insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover all costs and damages. In addition to the existing securities class action lawsuit filed against us on June 5, 2024 captioned Bishins v. Marinus Pharmaceuticals, Inc., et. al., Case 2:24-cv-02430, we could become involved in additional securities litigation. In the past, securities litigation has often followed certain significant business transactions, such as the sale of a company or announcement of any other strategic transaction, or the announcement of negative events, such as negative results from clinical trials. We may be exposed to such litigation even if no wrongdoing occurred. Litigation is usually expensive and diverts management s attention and resources, which could adversely affect our business and cash resources and our ability to consummate a potential strategic transaction or the ultimate value our stockholders receive in any such transaction . We and certain of our officers have been named as defendants in a pending securities class action lawsuit. This lawsuit, and potential similar or related lawsuits, could result in substantial damages, divert management s time and attention from our business, and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. This lawsuit, and any other lawsuits to which we are subject, will be costly to defend and is uncertain in its outcome. On June 5, 2024, a securities class action lawsuit captioned Bishins v. Marinus Pharmaceuticals, Inc., et. al., Case 2:24-cv-02430 was filed against us and certain of our officers in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. The complaint alleges violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder on the basis of purportedly materially false and misleading statements and omissions concerning our RAISE and RAISE II clinical trials. The complaint seeks, among other things, unspecified damages, attorneys fees, expert fees, and other costs. The court appointed a lead plaintiff and 

 53 

Table of Contents 
 lead counsel for the action on August 16, 2024. The lead plaintiff filed an amended complaint on October 4, 2024. We intend to move to dismiss the amended complaint on or before November 22, 2024. We intend to vigorously defend against this action. However, whether or not the claim is successful, litigation is often expensive and can divert management s attention and resources from other business concerns, which could adversely affect our business. We currently are not able to estimate the possible cost to us from this action, as the pending lawsuit is currently at an early stage, and we cannot be certain how long it may take to resolve the pending lawsuit or the possible amount of any damages that we may be required to pay. If we are ultimately required to pay significant defense costs, damages or settlement amounts, such payments could adversely affect our operations. We may be the target of similar litigation in the future. The market price of our common stock has experienced and may continue to experience volatility, and in the past, companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been subject to securities litigation. Any future litigation could result in substantial costs and divert our management s attention from other business concerns, which could seriously harm our business. We maintain liability insurance; however, if any costs or expenses associated with the pending lawsuit or any other litigation exceed our insurance coverage, we may be forced to bear some or all costs and expenses directly, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or stock price. An unfavorable outcome with the pending lawsuit or any other litigation could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, which, in turn, may result in or may contribute to an inability by us to meet the financial covenant contained in the RIFA. Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds None. Item 3. Defaults upon Senior Securities None. Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures Not applicable. Item 5. Other Information Trading Plans During the three months ended September 30, 2024, of our or (as defined in Rule 16a-1(f) of the Exchange Act) a Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement (as those terms are defined under Item 408 of Regulation S-K).
