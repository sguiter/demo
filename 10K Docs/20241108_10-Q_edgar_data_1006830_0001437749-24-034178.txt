 (Unaudited) (continued) 

(Dollars in thousands, except per share amounts) 

At September 30, 2024, the Company s portfolio consisted of securities, of which were available-for-sale and of which were held-to-maturity securities in unrealized or unrecognized loss positions. As of September 30, 2024, no allowance for credit losses has been recognized on securities in an unrealized loss position as management does not believe any of the securities are impaired due to reasons of credit quality. This is based upon our analysis of the underlying risk characteristics, including credit ratings, and other qualitative factors related to our available-for-sale securities. 

The Company s mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations were issued by U.S. government-sponsored entities and agencies. The Company does not own any private label mortgage-backed securities. The Company s municipal bond portfolio consists of tax-exempt and taxable general obligation and revenue bonds to a broad range of counties, towns, school districts, and other essential service providers. As of September 30, 2024, of the municipal bonds held in the available-for-sale portfolio had a S P or Moody s investment grade rating, and were non-rated issues. The municipal bonds in the held-to-maturity portfolio are all non-rated issues to local entities that are also deposit customers. The other debt securities consist of subordinated notes issued by other bank holding companies. 

The issuers of all securities owned by the Company continue to make timely principal and interest payments under the securities contractual terms. The unrealized losses related to these securities have not been recognized into income because the decline in fair value is not attributed to credit quality, management does not intend to sell the securities, and it is not likely that management will be required to sell the securities prior to their anticipated recovery. The unrealized losses on these securities are primarily due to increases in market interest rates over the yields available at the time the underlying securities were purchased. The securities fair value is expected to recover as the securities approach their maturity date or repricing date or if market yields for such investments decline. 

Equity Securities 

The Company owned equity securities with an amortized cost of and a fair value of as of September 30, 2024, and June 30, 2024. Changes in the fair value of these securities are included in noninterest income on the consolidated statements of income. There were no net unrealized gains or losses on equity securities recognized in earnings and there were no sales of equity securities during the three-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

Modifications to Borrowers Experiencing Financial Difficulty 

Occasionally, the Company modifies loans to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty to maximize collection of loan balances by providing principal forgiveness, term extension, an other-than insignificant payment delay, or an interest rate reduction. In some cases, the Company may provide multiple types of concessions on one loan. If principal forgiveness is provided, the amount of forgiveness is charged-off against the allowance for credit losses. 

There were no modifications of loans to borrowers in financial distress completed during the three-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

Collateral Dependent Loans 

A loan is considered to be collateral dependent when, based upon management's assessment, the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty and repayment is expected to be provided substantially through the operation or sale of the collateral. In such cases, expected credit losses are based on the fair value of the collateral at the measurement date, adjusted for estimated selling costs if satisfaction of the loan depends on the sale of the collateral. The following table presents the amortized cost of collateral dependent loans and the related allowance for credit losses allocated to these loans:

Credit Quality Indicators: 

 The Company categorizes loans into risk categories based on relevant information about the ability of borrowers to service their debt such as: current financial information, historical payment experience, credit documentation, public information, current economic trends and other relevant information. At the time of origination, the Company analyzes all commercial loans individually and classifies the loans by credit risk. Management regularly monitors commercial loans for any changes in the borrowers ability to service their debt and completes an annual review to confirm the risk rating for those loans with total outstanding loan relationships greater than 500. The Company uses the following definitions for risk ratings: 

Pass. Loans classified as pass exhibit a wide array of characteristics but at a minimum represent minimal level of risk and are considered collectable. Borrowers in this rating may have leveraged but acceptable balance sheet positions, satisfactory asset quality, stable to favorable sales and earnings trends, acceptable liquidity, and adequate cash flow. While generally adhering to credit policy, these loans may exhibit occasional exceptions that do not result in undue risk. Borrowers are generally capable of absorbing setbacks, financial and otherwise. 

Special Mention. Loans classified as special mention have a potential weakness that deserves management s close attention. If left uncorrected, these potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the loan or of the institution s credit position at some future date. 

Substandard. Loans classified as substandard are inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. Loans so classified have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt. They are characterized by the distinct possibility that the institution will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. 

Doubtful. Loans classified as doubtful have all the weaknesses inherent in those classified as substandard, with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, highly questionable and improbable. 

Not Rated. Loans listed as not rated are included in groups of homogeneous loans. Past due information is the primary credit indicator for groups of homogenous loans.

Certain assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis; that is, the instruments are not measured at fair value on an ongoing basis but are subject to fair value adjustments in certain circumstances. Assets that may be recorded at fair value on a nonrecurring basis include individually evaluated collateral dependent loans , other real estate owned, and other repossessed assets. 

Collateral Dependent Loans: The fair value of collateral dependent loans with specific allocations of the allowance for credit losses is generally based on recent real estate appraisals. Collateral dependent individually evaluated loans carried at fair value generally receive specific allocations of the allowance for credit losses or are charged down to their fair value. These appraisals may utilize a single valuation approach or a combination of approaches including comparable sales and the income approach. Adjustments are routinely made in the appraisal process by the appraisers to adjust for differences between the comparable sales and income data available. Such adjustments are usually significant and typically result in a Level 3 classification of the inputs for determining fair value. There were no collateral dependent individually evaluated loans measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis at September 30, 2024 or June 30, 2024. 

Other Real Estate and Repossessed Assets Owned: Assets acquired through or instead of loan foreclosure are initially recorded at fair value less costs to sell when acquired, establishing a new cost basis. Subsequent to their initial recognition, these assets are remeasured at fair value, which is the lower of cost or fair value less estimated costs to sell, through a write-down included in other non-interest expense. Real estate owned properties and other repossessed assets, which are primarily vehicles, are evaluated on a quarterly basis for additional impairment and adjusted accordingly. There were no such fair value measurement adjustments recorded during the periods ended September 30, 2024 or 2023. There was no other real estate owned and other repossessed assets as of September 30, 2024 or June 30, 2024.

The following table shows the estimated fair values of financial instruments that are reported at amortized cost in the Company s consolidated balance sheets, segregated by the level of the valuation inputs within the fair value hierarchy utilized to measure fair value: 

Level 2 inputs: 

Loans held for sale 

Accrued interest receivable 

Level 3 inputs: 

Securities held-to-maturity 

Loans, net 

Financial Liabilities: 

Level 2 inputs: 

Demand and savings deposits 

Time deposits 

Short-term borrowings 

Federal Home Loan Bank advances 

Accrued interest payable 

The assumptions used to estimate fair value are described as follows: 

Cash and cash equivalents: The carrying value of cash and deposits in other financial institutions were considered to approximate fair value resulting in a Level 1 classification. 

Accrued interest receivable and payable, demand and savings deposits and short-term borrowings : The carrying value of accrued interest receivable and payable, demand and savings deposits and short-term borrowings were considered to approximate fair value due to their short-term duration resulting in a Level 2 classification. 

Loans held for sale: The fair value of loans held for sale is estimated based upon binding contracts and quotes from third party investors resulting in a Level 2 classification. 

Loans: Fair value for loans was estimated for portfolios of loans with similar financial characteristics. The estimated fair value approximates carrying value for variable-rate loans that reprice frequently and with no significant change in credit risk. The fair value of fixed-rate loans and variable-rate loans which reprice on an infrequent basis is estimated by discounting future cash flows using the current interest rates at which similar loans with similar terms would be made to borrowers of similar credit quality resulting in a Level 3 classification. An overall valuation adjustment is made for specific credit risks as well as general portfolio credit risk. 

Securities held-to-maturity: The held-to-maturity securities are general obligation and revenue bonds issued by local municipalities. The fair value of these securities are calculated using a spread to the applicable municipal fair market curve resulting in a Level 3 classification. 

Time deposits: Fair value of fixed-maturity certificates of deposit was estimated using the rates offered at September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024 for deposits of similar remaining maturities, resulting in Level 2 classification. Estimated fair value does not include the benefit that results from low-cost funding provided by the deposit liabilities compared to the cost of borrowing funds in the market.

(Dollars in thousands, except per share amounts) 

Federal Home Loan Bank advances: Fair value of Federal Home Loan Bank advances was estimated using current rates at September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024 for similar financing resulting in a Level 2 classification. 

Federal bank and other restricted stocks, at cost: Federal bank and other restricted stocks include stock acquired for regulatory purposes, such as Federal Home Loan Bank stock and Federal Reserve Bank stock that are accounted for at cost due to restrictions placed on their transferability, and, therefore, are not subject to the fair value disclosure requirements. 

Off-balance sheet commitments: The Company s lending commitments have variable interest rates and escape clauses if the customer s credit quality deteriorates. Therefore, the fair values of these items are not significant and are not included in the above table.

Item 2 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

(Dollars in thousands, except per share data) 

General 

 The following is management s analysis of the Company s results of operations for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in fiscal year 2023, and the consolidated balance sheet at September 30, 2024, compared to June 30, 2024. This discussion is designed to provide a more comprehensive review of the operating results and financial condition than could be obtained from an examination of the financial statements alone. This analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related footnotes and the selected financial data included elsewhere in this report. 

Overview 

 Consumers Bancorp, Inc., a bank holding company incorporated under the laws of the State of Ohio (the Company), owns all the issued and outstanding common shares of Consumers National Bank, a bank chartered under the laws of the United States of America (the Bank). The Company s activities have been limited primarily to holding the common shares of the Bank. The Bank s business involves attracting deposits from businesses and individual customers and using such deposits to originate commercial, mortgage and consumer loans in its market area, consisting primarily of Carroll, Columbiana, Jefferson, Mahoning, Stark, Summit, and contiguous counties in Ohio, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia. The Bank also invests in securities consisting primarily of U.S. government sponsored entities, municipal obligations, mortgage-backed and collateralized mortgage obligations issued by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae. 

Results of Operations 

 Three-Month Periods Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 

Net income for the first quarter of fiscal year 2025 was 2,236, or 0.72 per common share, compared to 2,410, or 0.78 per common share for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The following are key highlights of our results of operations for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared with the prior fiscal year comparable period: 

net interest income decreased by 111 or 1.4 , to 8,043 in the first quarter of fiscal year 2025 from the same prior year period mainly because of the rapid increase in short-term market rates in 2023 and 2024 causing interest bearing liabilities to reprice faster than interest earning assets; 

a 77 provision for credit losses on loans and a 45 reduction to the provision for credit losses on unfunded commitments was recorded for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 compared with a 40 provision for credit losses on loans and a 79 provision for credit losses on unfunded commitments for the same prior year period. The reduction to the reserve for unfunded commitments recorded in the first quarter of fiscal year 2025 was the result of lower loss rates and a reduction in the balance of unfunded commitments.; 

noninterest income increased by 236, or 20.4 , in the first quarter of fiscal year 2025 from the same prior year period. A 79 loss on the sale of lower yielding securities was included in noninterest income during the three-month period ended September 30, 2023. Excluding this securities loss, noninterest income increased by 157, or 12.7 , compared with the same prior year period primarily because of an increase in debit card interchange income of 65, or 11.8 , gains from mortgage banking activity of 35, or 35.7 , and an increase in service charges on deposit accounts of 24, or 5.6 . 

noninterest expenses increased by 423, or 6.8 , in the first quarter of fiscal year 2025 from the same prior year period primarily due to increases in salaries and benefits, software expenses, and debit card processing expenses. 

The annualized return on average equity and return on average assets were 13.08 and 0.80 , respectively, for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 17.31 and 0.90 , respectively, for the same prior year period.

Net Interest Income 

 Net interest income, the difference between interest income earned on interest-earning assets and interest expense incurred on interest-bearing liabilities, is the largest component of the Company s earnings. Net interest income is affected by changes in the volumes, rates and composition of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. In addition, prevailing economic conditions, fiscal and monetary policies and the policies of various regulatory agencies all affect market rates of interest and the availability and cost of credit, which, in turn, can significantly affect net interest income. Net interest margin is calculated by dividing net interest income on a fully tax equivalent basis (FTE) by total average interest-earning assets. FTE income includes tax-exempt income, restated to a pre-tax equivalent, based on the statutory federal income tax rate. The federal income tax rate in effect for the 2025 and 2024 fiscal years was 21.0 . All average balances are daily average balances. Non-accruing loans are included in average loan balances and average securities include unrealized gains and losses on securities available-for-sale, while yields are based on average amortized cost. 

The Company s net interest margin was 2.92 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared with 3.09 for the same prior year period. FTE net interest income for the three months ended September 30, 2024, decreased by 171, or 2.1 , to 7,940 from 8,111 for the same prior year period. 

The yield on average interest-earning assets increased to 4.81 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared with 4.45 for the same period last year. Tax-equivalent interest income increased by 1,359, or 11.6 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from the same prior year period because of a 42,325, or 4.2 , increase in average interest-earning assets as well as the affect of higher market interest rates on new and repricing earning assets. However, the yield on nontaxable securities is being negatively impacted since the interest expense attributable to carrying tax exempt securities is not deductible. Interest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 1,530 from the same prior year period primarily due to an increase in savings and time deposit costs as a result of higher market interest rates, an increase in competition for deposits impacting the time deposit and money market offering rates, and from a shift of funds from lower yielding deposit products to higher yielding time and money market accounts. The Company s cost of funds increased to 2.56 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared with 1.91 for the same prior year period. Competitive pressures on deposit pricing have begun to ease and pricing on money market accounts and time deposits were able to be reduced following the 50-basis point cut in the discount rate in September 2024. As a result, management expects the cost of funds to trend downward in future quarters.

Provision for Credit Losses 

 The allowance for credit losses on loans consists of general and specific components. The general component covers loans collectively evaluated for credit loss and is based on peer historical loss experience adjusted for current and forecasted factors. For each portfolio segment, a loss driver analysis (LDA) is performed to identify appropriate loss indicators and create a regression model for use in forecasting cash flows. The LDA analysis utilizes peer data from the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council s (FFIEC) Call Report data for all segments. Since the Company has had very limited loss experience, management elected to utilize benchmark peer loss history data to estimate historical loss rates. The Company has established a one-year reasonable and supportable forecast period with a one-year straight-line reversion to the long-term historical average. The Company uses the central tendency seasonally adjusted civilian unemployment rate forecast from the Federal Open Market Committee for all portfolio segments. Other key assumptions include a maturity assumption for loans without maturity dates and prepayment / curtailment rates specific to each loan segment. Prepayment and curtailment rates are calculated based on the Company s own data. 

Management's adjustments to the quantitative evaluation may be for trends in delinquencies, trends in the volume of loans, changes in underwriting standards, changes in the value of underlying collateral, the existence and effect of portfolio concentration, regulatory environment, economic conditions, Company management and the status of portfolio administration including the Company s loan review function. 

The specific component includes loans that do not share similar risk characteristics that are evaluated on an individual basis and are excluded from the pooling approach. As of September 30, 2024, individually evaluated loans totaled 29,776 and included the 28,865 third-party residential mortgage warehouse line-of-credit and 911 of nonaccrual loans. The warehouse line-of-credit is included in individually evaluated loans because of the unique structure of the loan given the short-term nature of the advances, curtailment features provided by the lead financial institution that provides the lines-of-credit, as well as being secured by individual residential properties. There was a 66 specific allocation of the allowance for credit losses to the individually evaluated loans as of September 30, 2024. 

For the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, the provision for credit losses on loans was 77 compared with 40 for the same period last year. The allowance for credit losses as a percentage of loans was 1.04 at September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024. Net charge-offs of 59, or an annualized 0.03 of total loans, were recorded during the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 compared with net charge offs of 34, or an annualized 0.02 of total loans, for the same period last year. 

Non-performing loans were 919 as of September 30, 2024, compared with 858 as of June 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, non-performing loans included 359 that is guaranteed by the Small Business Administration. Non-performing loans to total loans were 0.12 , or 0.07 excluding the guaranteed portion, at September 30, 2024 and 0.11 , or 0.07 excluding the guaranteed portion, at June 30, 2024. Uncertainty remains regarding future levels of criticized and classified loans, non-performing loans and charge-offs. Management will continue to closely monitor changes in the loan portfolio and will work with borrowers as needed to mitigate losses to the Company. 

The allowance for credit losses on off-balance sheet credit exposures is a liability account representing expected credit losses over the contractual period for which the Company is exposed to credit risk resulting from a contractual obligation to extend credit. The reserve for unfunded commitments is primarily related to 1 - 4 family home equity lines of credit and construction loans, land development loans, and commercial construction loans. For the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, a reduction of 45 was recorded to the reserve for unfunded commitments compared with a 79 reserve for the same period last year. The reduction to the reserve recorded in the first quarter of fiscal year 2025 was the result of lower loss rates and a reduction in the balance of unfunded commitments. 

Noninterest Income 

 Noninterest income increased by 236, or 20.4 , for the first quarter of fiscal year 2025 from the same period last year. During the three-month period ended September 30, 2023, a 79 loss on the sale of lower yielding securities was included in noninterest income. Excluding this securities loss, noninterest income increased by 157, or 12.7 , compared with the same prior year period primarily because of an increase in debit card interchange income of 65, or 11.8 , gains from mortgage banking activity of 35, or 35.7 , and an increase in service charges on deposit accounts of 24, or 5.6 .

(Dollars in thousands, except per share data) 

Noninterest Expenses 

 Total noninterest expenses increased by 423, or 6.8 , for the first quarter of fiscal year 2025 compared with the same period last year. Salaries and employee benefits expenses increased by 266, or 7.6 , for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same prior year period primarily due to merit and cost of living increases and increases to incentive expense accruals. Occupancy and equipment expenses increased by 100, or 12.8 , for the first quarter of fiscal year 2025 compared with the same period last year primarily because of investments in new software, increases in software licensing fees, and increases in building maintenance and repair. Debit card processing expenses increased by 50, or 16.0 , for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same prior year period primarily due to an increase in customer card usage and an increase in the number of cards issued. These increases were partially offset by a decline of 56, or 58.3 in Ohio franchise tax expense for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same prior year period due to the full year impact of the reduction in total shareholders equity because of the accumulated other comprehensive loss. 

Income Taxes 

 Income tax expense was 480 for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 compared to 517 for the three-month period ended September 30, 2023. The effective tax rate was 17.7 for both of the three-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The effective tax rates differed from the federal statutory rate because of tax-exempt income from obligations of state and political subdivisions, loans, bank owned life insurance income, and the low-income housing tax credits. 

Financial Condition 

 Total assets as of September 30, 2024 were 1,123,853 compared to 1,097,089 at June 30, 2024, an increase of 26,764, or an annualized 9.8 . From June 30, 2024 to September 30, 2024, total loans increased by 7,359, or an annualized 3.9 , and total deposits increased by 25,912, or an annualized 10.7 . 

Available-for-sale securities increased from 264,802 as of June 30, 2024, to 272,757 as of September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, the portfolio had an unrealized loss of 26,051 as a result of the increase in market interest rates compared with the yields within the portfolio that were available at the time the underlying securities were purchased. The fair value is expected to recover as the securities approach their maturity or repricing dates or if market yields for such securities decline. The portfolio is primarily comprised of agency mortgage-backed securities, obligations of state and political subdivisions, other government agencies debt, corporate debt, and U.S. Treasury notes. The municipal bond portfolio consists of tax-exempt and taxable general obligations and revenue bonds to a broad range of counties, towns, school districts, and other essential service providers. As of September 30, 2024, 97.4 of the municipal bonds held in the available-for-sale portfolio had an S P or Moody s investment grade rating, and 2.6 were non-rated issues. The other debt securities consist of subordinated notes issued by other bank holding companies. As of September 30, 2024, the projected cash flow from the portfolio over the next 12 months was approximately 39,679 which may be available to reinvest into loans or securities at the then current market rates. 

Total loans increased by 7,359, or an annualized 3.9 , from June 30, 2024. The growth in loans was primarily within the commercial real estate and consumer loan portfolios. Consumer loan growth was primarily from indirect loans due to the expansion of the indirect dealer network.

As of September 30, 2024, non-accrual loans include loans that are guaranteed by the Small Business Administration. Excluding the guaranteed portion, non-performing loans were 560, or 0.07 of total loans as of September 30, 2024. 

Contractual Obligations, Commitments, Contingent Liabilities and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

Liquidity 

 The objective of liquidity management is to ensure adequate cash flows to accommodate the demands of our customers and provide adequate flexibility for the Company to take advantage of market opportunities under both normal operating conditions and under unpredictable circumstances of industry or market stress. Cash is used to fund loans, purchase investments, fund the maturity of liabilities, and, at times, to fund deposit outflows and operating activities. The Company s principal sources of funds are deposits; amortization and prepayments of loans; maturities, sales and principal receipts from securities; borrowings; and operations. Management considers the asset position of the Company to be sufficiently liquid to meet normal operating needs and conditions. The Company s earning assets are mainly comprised of loans and investment securities. Management continually strives to obtain the best mix of loans and investments to both maximize yield and ensure the soundness of the portfolio, as well as to provide funding for loan demand as needed. 

For the three months ended September 30, 2024, net cash inflows from operating activities was 1,142, net cash outflows from investing activities was 8,802 and net cash inflows from financing activities was 16,862. A major source of cash was 25,912 from the increase in deposits and 8,423 from maturity, calls, and principal pay downs of available-for-sale securities. A major use of cash was 7,418 for loan originations. Total cash and cash equivalents were 26,925 as of September 30, 2024, compared to 17,723 at June 30, 2024 and 19,643 at September 30, 2023. 

The Bank offers several types of deposit products to a diverse base of business, public fund, and personal customers. We believe the rates offered by the Bank and the fees charged for them are competitive with the rates and fees charged by other banks for similar deposit products currently available in the market area. Deposits totaled 998,892 at September 30, 2024, an increase of 25,912, or an annualized 10.7 , compared with 972,980 at June 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, the estimated percentage of uninsured deposits, excluding collateralized public fund deposits, was 18.3 . 

Jumbo time deposits (those with balances of 250 and over) totaled 66,735 as of September 30, 2024 and 59,233 as of June 30, 2024 and are from local customers and businesses. These deposits are monitored closely by the Company and are mainly priced on an individual basis. The Company has the option to use a fee-paid broker or CD listing service to obtain deposits from outside its normal service area as an additional source of funding. The Company, however, does not rely upon these types of deposits as a primary source of funding. There were 2,049 and 6,004 of deposits classified as brokered deposits as of September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, respectively. Although management monitors interest rates on an ongoing basis, a quarterly rate sensitivity report is used to determine the effect of interest rate changes on the financial statements. In the opinion of management, enough assets or liabilities could be repriced over the near term (up to three years) to compensate for such changes. The spread on interest rates, or the difference between the average earning assets and the average interest-bearing liabilities, is monitored monthly. 

To provide additional sources of liquidity, the Company has lines of credit with other financial institutions and entered into agreements with the FHLB of Cincinnati and the Federal Reserve discount window. At September 30, 2024, advances from the FHLB of Cincinnati totaled 8,087 compared with 13,709 at June 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, the Bank had the ability to borrow an additional 102,155 from the FHLB of Cincinnati based on a blanket pledge of qualifying first mortgage and multi-family loans. The Company considers the FHLB of Cincinnati to be a reliable source of liquidity funding, secondary to its deposit base. In addition, at September 30, 2024, the Company had approximately 96,877 in securities unencumbered by a pledge that could be used to support additional borrowings, as needed, through the Federal Reserve discount window.

Repurchase agreements are financing arrangements with local customers that mature daily. The Bank pledges securities as collateral for the repurchase agreements. The Federal Reserve s Bank Term Funding Program (BTFP) was a facility established in 2023 in response to liquidity concerns within the banking industry and the program ceased making new loans on March 11, 2024. The BTFP was designed to provide additional funding to eligible depository institutions in order to help assure that banks had the ability to meet the needs of all their depositors. Under the program, eligible depository institutions could obtain loans of up to one year in length by pledging certain U.S. Treasuries, agency debt, mortgage-backed securities, and other qualifying assets as collateral. These assets were valued at par. A line of credit from another financial institution was established since the holding company does not conduct operations and its primary sources of liquidity are dividends upstreamed from the Bank and borrowings from outside sources. As of September 30, 2024, the available credit on the holding company s line of credit was 5,000. 

To meet the financial needs of our customers, we have issued commitments to originate mortgage, commercial, construction, and consumer loans and commitments for commercial, home equity, and consumer lines of credit. Since commitments to extend credit have a fixed expiration date or other termination clause, some commitments will expire without being drawn upon and the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. Financial standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. The same credit policies are used in making commitments and financial standby letters of credit as are used for on-balance sheet instruments. Total unused commitments were 142,769 as of September 30, 2024, and 145,796 as of June 30, 202. 

Capital Resources 

 Total shareholders equity increased by 9,616 to 73,301 as of September 30, 2024, from 63,685 as of June 30, 2024 because of a reduction of 7,751 in the accumulated other comprehensive loss from the mark-to-market of available-for-sale securities and from net income of 2,236 for the first three months of fiscal year 2025 which was partially offset by cash dividends paid of 594. As market interest rates rise, the fair value of fixed-rate available-for-sale securities decline with a corresponding net of tax decline recorded in the accumulated other comprehensive loss portion of equity. The fair value is expected to recover as the securities approach their maturity date or repricing date or if market yields for such securities decline. 

The Bank is subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by federal regulatory agencies. Capital adequacy guidelines and prompt corrective-action regulations involve quantitative measures of assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance-sheet items calculated under regulatory accounting practices. Failure to meet various capital requirements can initiate regulatory action that could have a direct material effect on the Company s financial statements. 

As of September 30, 2024, the Bank s common equity tier 1 capital and tier 1 capital ratios were 11.13 and the leverage and total risk-based capital ratios were 8.05 and 12.13 , respectively. This compares with common equity tier 1 capital and tier 1 capital ratios of 11.07 and leverage and total risk-based capital ratios of 7.98 and 12.07 , respectively, as of June 30, 2024. The Bank exceeded minimum regulatory capital requirements to be considered well-capitalized for both periods. Management is not aware of any matters occurring subsequent to September 30, 2024 that would cause the Bank s capital category to change. 

Critical Accounting Policies 

 The Company s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and follow general practices within the industry in which it operates. Application of these principles requires management to make estimates or judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. These estimates are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements; accordingly, as this information changes, the financial statements could reflect different estimates or judgments. Certain policies inherently have a greater reliance on the use of estimates, and as such have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported.

 Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition 

 and Results of Operations 

(Dollars in thousands, except per share data) 

Critical accounting policies are those policies that are highly dependent on subjective or complex judgments, estimates and assumptions and where changes in those estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on the financial statements. The Company has identified the appropriateness of the allowance for credit losses and the evaluation of goodwill for impairment as critical accounting policies and an understanding of these policies is necessary to understand the financial statements. Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Adoption of ASC 326 and Allowance for Credit Losses) and Note 3 (Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses) of the Company s Consolidated Financial Statements provide detail regarding the Company s accounting for the allowance for credit losses. Note 5 (Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets) and Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation (Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Significant Estimates) of the 2024 Form 10-K provide detail regarding the Company s accounting for Goodwill. 

Forward-Looking Statements 

 Certain statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, which are not statements of historical fact, constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. The words may, continue, estimate, intend, plan, seek, will, believe, project, expect, anticipate and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements may involve risks and uncertainties that are difficult to predict, may be beyond our control, and could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in such statements. Any such forward-looking statements are made only as of the date of this report or the respective dates of the relevant incorporated documents, as the case may be, and, except as required by law, we undertake no obligation to update these forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. Risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results for future periods to differ materially from those anticipated or projected include, but are not limited to: 

changes in local, regional and national economic conditions becoming less favorable than we expect, resulting in a deterioration in asset credit quality or debtors being unable to meet their obligations because of high unemployment rates and inflationary pressures; 

rapid fluctuations in market interest rates could result in changes in fair market valuations and a decline in net interest income; 

changes in the level of non-performing assets and charge-offs; 

unanticipated changes in our liquidity position, including, but not limited to, changes in the cost of liquidity, our ability to find alternative funding sources, and potential market reactions to the default or risk of default by other financial institutions; 

the effect of changes in laws and regulations (including laws and regulations concerning taxes, banking, securities, and insurance) with which we must comply; 

the effects of, and changes in, trade, monetary and fiscal policies and laws, including interest rate policies of the Federal Reserve Board; 

breaches of security or failures of our or our vendor s technology systems due to technological or other factors and cybersecurity threats; 

changes in consumer spending, borrowing and savings habits; 

declining asset values impacting the underlying value of collateral; 

changes in accounting policies, rules and interpretations; 

our ability to attract and retain qualified employees; 

competitive pressures on product pricing and services; and 

changes in the reliability of our vendors, internal control systems or information systems.
