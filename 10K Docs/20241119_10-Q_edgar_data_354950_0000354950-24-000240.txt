 operating segments into reportable segment (the Primary segment due to the similar nature of their operations and economic characteristics. 
 As discussed in Note 10 , in June 2024, we acquired SRS, a leading residential specialty trade distribution company across several verticals serving the professional roofer, landscaper and pool contractor through its branches located throughout the U.S. SRS is organized as three different lines of business: roofing and complementary building products, landscape, and pool. We have determined that each of these three lines of business represents an operating segment, none of which meets the thresholds prescribed under Topic 280 to be deemed a reportable segment.

 Deferred Revenue 
 For products and services sold in stores or online, payment is typically due at the point of sale. When we receive payment before the customer has taken possession of the merchandise or the service has been performed, the amount received is recorded as deferred revenue until the sale or service is complete. Such performance obligations are part of contracts with expected original durations of typically three months or less. As of October 27, 2024 and January 28, 2024, deferred revenue for products and services was billion and billion, respectively.

 ) ) Goodwill, balance at October 27, 2024 

(1) Fiscal 2024 activity represents the preliminary determination of goodwill related to the SRS acquisition, as well as other immaterial acquisitions completed by SRS during the third quarter of fiscal 2024. See Note 10 for details regarding the SRS acquisition. 
 (2) Primarily reflects the net impact of foreign currency translation as well as immaterial measurement period adjustments related to fiscal 2023 acquisitions. 
 During the third quarter of fiscal 2024, we completed our annual assessment of the recoverability of goodwill for our U.S., Canada, and Mexico reporting units that reside within our Primary segment. As the results of our most recent quantitative analysis in fiscal 2023 indicated that the fair value of each reporting unit substantially exceeded its respective carrying value, we performed a qualitative assessment to determine if there were any indicators of impairment. Based on this assessment, we concluded that while there have been events and circumstances that have both positively and negatively impacted our reporting units, no single factor or combination of factors is an indicator that it is more likely than not that the fair value of any of these reporting units was less than its carrying amount. 
 Additionally, following the completion of the SRS acquisition, we now have new reporting units which align with our SRS operating segments: roofing and complementary building products, landscape, and pool. As a result of the recency of the acquisition to our annual assessment date, these reporting units were also analyzed for impairment during the third quarter of fiscal 2024 using a qualitative approach. Based on this analysis, we concluded that there were no events or circumstances that would indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of any of these reporting units was less than its carrying amount.

 During the third quarter of fiscal 2024, we completed our annual assessment of the recoverability of our indefinite-lived intangible assets based on quantitative factors and concluded no impairment losses should be recognized.

 billion. In connection with this program, we had back-up credit facilities with a consortium of banks for borrowings up to billion, which consisted of a billion credit facility scheduled to expire in July 2027 and a -day billion credit facility scheduled to expire in July 2024. At January 28, 2024, there were outstanding borrowings under our commercial paper program or back-up credit facilities. 
 In May 2024, we increased our commercial paper program from billion to billion in connection with the anticipated financing of the acquisition of SRS (see Note 10 for details regarding the SRS acquisition). In May 2024, in connection with the increase in the commercial paper program, we also entered into additional back-up credit facilities that consisted of a -day billion credit facility scheduled to expire in May 2025, a billion credit facility scheduled to expire in May 2027, and a -day billion credit facility scheduled to expire in May 2025. The billion credit facility also provided that the commitments and any borrowings under that facility would be reduced by the amount of net cash proceeds we received from any future debt issuance. 
 In June 2024, leading up to the acquisition of SRS on June 18, 2024, we raised commercial paper borrowings of over billion to fund the transaction. On June 25, 2024, we received the proceeds from the issuance of billion of long-term debt, as further discussed below, and immediately used the proceeds to repay approximately billion of these commercial paper borrowings. On June 27, 2024, we terminated the billion back-up credit facility and subsequently reduced our commercial paper program from billion to billion. 
 In July 2024, we completed the renewal of our -day billion credit facility, extending the maturity from July 2024 to July 2025. As of October 27, 2024, our commercial paper program allowed for borrowings up to billion and is supported by billion of back-up credit facilities. 
 All of our short-term borrowings in the first nine months of fiscal 2024 were under our commercial paper program, and the maximum amount outstanding at any time was billion. At October 27, 2024, we had billion of outstanding borrowings under our commercial paper program with a weighted average interest rate of and outstanding borrowings under our back-up credit facilities.

 June 2024 Issuance. In June 2024, we issued tranches of senior notes.

With respect to all fixed rate notes other than the 2025 and 2026 notes, on or after the relevant Par Call Date, the redemption price is equal to of the principal amount of such notes. Additionally, if a Change in Control Triggering Event occurs, as defined in the notes, holders of all such notes have the right to require us to offer payment, in cash, for those notes equal to of the aggregate principal amount of such notes plus accrued and unpaid interest up to the date of purchase. 
 The indenture governing these notes does not generally limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness or require us to maintain financial ratios or specified levels of net worth or liquidity. The indenture governing the notes contains various customary covenants; however, none of the covenants are expected to impact our liquidity or capital resources. 
 Repayments . In February 2024, we repaid our billion senior notes at maturity. 
 Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities 
 We had outstanding interest rate swap agreements with combined notional amounts of billion at both October 27, 2024 and January 28, 2024. These agreements are accounted for as fair value hedges that swap fixed for variable rate interest to hedge changes in the fair values of certain senior notes. At October 27, 2024 and January 28, 2024, the fair values of these agreements totaled million and million, respectively, all of which are recognized within other long-term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. 
 All of our interest rate swap agreements are designated as fair value hedges and meet the shortcut method requirements under GAAP. Accordingly, the changes in the fair values of these agreements offset the changes in the fair value of the hedged long-term debt.

(1) In connection with the acquisition, certain members of SRS s management team concurrently reinvested a portion of their respective after-tax merger consideration proceeds into shares of the Company s common stock. A portion of such shares of Company common stock are fully vested, and accordingly, the fair value of such shares was recorded as non-cash purchase consideration. A portion of such shares of Company common stock, which replaced legacy SRS stock-based awards, are subject to service-based vesting conditions over a period and become forfeitable if such vesting conditions are not satisfied. Accordingly, a portion of the fair value of these shares was recorded as non-cash purchase consideration, and the remainder will be recorded as post-combination expense over the vesting period. The fair value of these shares, including the amount which will be recorded as post-combination compensation expense, is not material.

 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
 To the Stockholders and Board of Directors 
 The Home Depot, Inc.: 
 Results of Review of Interim Financial Information 
 We have reviewed the consolidated balance sheet of The Home Depot, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the Company as of October 27, 2024, the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income and stockholders equity for the three-month and nine-month periods ended October 27, 2024 and October 29, 2023, the related consolidated statements of cash flows for the nine-month periods ended October 27, 2024 and October 29, 2023, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated interim financial information ). Based on our reviews, we are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to the consolidated interim financial information for it to be in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 
 We have previously audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) PCAOB ), the consolidated balance sheet of the Company as of January 28, 2024, and the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income, stockholders equity, and cash flows for the fiscal year then ended (not presented herein); and in our report dated March 13, 2024, we expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. In our opinion, the information set forth in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of January 28, 2024 is fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the consolidated balance sheet from which it has been derived. 
 Basis for Review Results 
 This consolidated interim financial information is the responsibility of the Company s management. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 We conducted our reviews in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. A review of consolidated interim financial information consists principally of applying analytical procedures and making inquiries of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters. It is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB, the objective of which is the expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements taken as a whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
 We reported net sales of 40.2 billion in the third quarter of fiscal 2024. Net earnings were 3.6 billion, or 3.67 per diluted share. For the first nine months of fiscal 2024, net sales were 119.8 billion and net earnings were 11.8 billion, or 11.90 per diluted share. 
 D uring the third quarter of fiscal 2024 , we opened five new stores in the U.S., resulting in a total store count of 2,345 at October 27, 2024. A total of 321 stores, or 13.7 , were located in Canada and Mexico. For the third quarter of fiscal 2024, sales per retail square foot were 582.97, and for the first nine months of fiscal 2024, sales per retail square foot were 604.11. Our inventory turnover ratio was 4.8 times at the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2024, compared to 4.3 times at the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2023. The increase in our inventory turnover ratio was primarily driven by lower average inventory levels within our Primary segment during the first nine months of fiscal 2024. 
 During the first nine months of fiscal 2024, we generated 15.1 billion of cash flow from operations, received approximately 10.0 billion of proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt, net of discounts, and received 1.3 billion of proceeds from commercial paper borrowings, net of repayments. We utilized a combination of commercial paper borrowings and the issuance of long-term debt, together with cash on hand, to fund the acquisition of SRS, with cash purchase consideration totaling 17.7 billion. Specifically, in June 2024, leading up to the acquisition on June 18, 2024, we raised commercial paper borrowings of over 15.0 billion to fund the transaction, of which approximately 10.0 billion was then immediately repaid with the proceeds from our issuance of long-term debt. We have continued to repay a portion of these outstanding commercial paper borrowings and ended the third quarter of fiscal 2024 with 1.3 billion of commercial paper borrowings outstanding. 
 During the first nine months of fiscal 2024, we also paid 6.7 billion in cash dividends, funded 2.4 billion in capital expenditures, repaid 1.4 billion of long-term debt, and funded 649 million of share repurchases, prior to pausing share repurchases in March 2024. 
 In February 2024, we announced a 7.7 increase in our quarterly cash dividend to 2.25 per share. 
 Our ROIC for the trailing twelve-month period was 31.5 at the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2024 and 38.7 at the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2023. The decrease in ROIC was primarily driven by higher average long-term debt and higher average equity due to the financing of the SRS acquisition, along with lower operating income. See the Non-GAAP Financial Measures section below for our definition and calculation of ROIC. 
 SRS Acquisition 
 On March 27, 2024, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire SRS, a leading residential specialty trade distribution company across several verticals serving the professional roofer, landscaper and pool contractor. On June 18, 2024, following the satisfaction or waiver of the applicable closing conditions, including receipt of the requisite regulatory approvals, the acquisition was completed and all merger consideration was transferred. We believe the acquisition of SRS will accelerate the Company s growth with the residential professional customer. The acquisition is expected to complement our existing capabilities and enable us to better serve complex project purchase occasions with the renovator/remodeler, while also establishing the Company as a leading specialty trade distributor across multiple verticals. Refer to Note 2 and Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the impact of the acquisition on our consolidated financial statements.

 (1) Does not include results for HD Supply or SRS. At this time, we are still evaluating whether SRS results will be incorporated into our selected sales metrics. 
 (2) Average ticket represents the average price paid per transaction and is used by management to monitor the performance of the Company, as it represents a primary driver in measuring sales performance. 
 (3) Sales per retail square foot represents annualized sales divided by retail store square footage. Sales per retail square foot is a measure of the efficiency of sales based on the total square footage of our stores and is used by management to monitor the performance of the Company s retail operations as an indicator of the productivity of owned and leased square footage for these retail operations. 
 Sales 
 We assess our sales performance by evaluating both net sales and comparable sales. 
 Net Sales. Net sales for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 were 40.2 billion, an increase of 6.6 from 37.7 billion for the third quarter of fiscal 2023. The increase in net sales for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 was primarily driven by SRS, which contributed 2.9 billion of net sales during the third quarter of fiscal 2024. This increase in net sales was partially offset by the impact of a negative comparable sales environment, primarily driven by decreases in comparable average ticket and comparable customer transactions. 
 Fiscal Q3 2024 Form 10-Q

Table of Contents 

 Online sales, which consist of sales generated through our websites and mobile applications for products picked up at our stores or delivered to customer locations, represented 14.0 of net sales during the third quarter of fiscal 2024 and increased by 4.0 compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2023. 
 A stronger U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales by 131 million duri ng the third quarter of fiscal 2024. 
 Comparable Sales. Comparable sales is a measure that highlights the performance of our existing locations and websites by measuring the change in net sales for a period over the comparable prior period of equivalent length. Comparable sales includes sales at all locations, physical and online, open greater than 52 weeks (including remodels and relocations) and excludes closed stores. Retail stores become comparable on the Monday following their 52 nd week of operation. Acquisitions are typically included in comparable sales after they have been owned for more than 52 weeks. Comparable sales is intended only as supplemental information and is not a substitute for net sales presented in accordance with GAAP. 
 Total comparable sales for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 decreased 1.3 , reflecting a 0.8 decrease in comparable average ticket and a 0.6 decrease in comparable customer transactions compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2023. The decrease in comparable customer transactions primarily reflects the impact of heightened macroeconomic uncertainties and other macroeconomic factors, including the impacts of a persisting high interest rate environment pressuring home improvement demand. The decrease in comparable average ticket primarily reflects price stabilization relative to last year, slightly offset by demand for new and innovative products. Comparable sales during the third quarter of fiscal 2024 also reflects incremental sales related to hurricane demand. 
 During the third quarter of fiscal 2024, our Power, Outdoor Garden, Building Materials, Indoor Garden, and Paint merchandising departments posted positive comparable sales compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2023. All of our other merchandising departments posted negative comparable sales during the third quarter of fiscal 2024 compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2023. 
 Gross Profit 
 Gross profit for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 increased 5.4 to 13.4 billion from 12.7 billion for the third quarter of fiscal 2023. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales, or gross profit margin, was 33.4 for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 compared to 33.8 for the third quarter of fiscal 2023. The decrease in gross profit margin primarily reflects the inclusion of SRS in our consolidated results, partially offset by lower shrink within our Primary segment. 
 Operating Expenses 
 Our operating expenses are composed of SG A and depreciation and amortization. 
 Selling, General Administrative. SG A for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 increased 563 million, or 8.5 , to 7.2 billion from 6.6 billion for the third quarter of fiscal 2023. As a percentage of net sales, SG A was 17.9 for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 compared to 17.6 for the third quarter of fiscal 2023, primarily reflecting higher payroll and other operational costs, along with deleverage from a negative comparable sales environment, all within our Primary segment, partially offset by the inclusion of SRS in our consolidated results. 
 Depreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 increased 112 million, or 16.4 , to 795 million from 683 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2023. As a percentage of net sales, depreciation and amortization was 2.0 for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 compared to 1.8 for the third quarter of fiscal 2023, primarily reflecting increased intangible asset amortization expense of 90 million, of which 86 million was related to SRS. 
 Interest and Other, net 
 Interest and other, net for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 increased 157 million, or 35.8 , to 595 million from 438 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2023. As a percentage of net sales, interest and other, net was 1.5 for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 compared to 1.2 for the third quarter of fiscal 2023, primarily reflecting higher interest expense driven by higher long-term debt. 
 Provision for Income Taxes 
 Our combined effective income tax rate was 24.4 for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 compared to 23.3 for the third quarter of fiscal 2023. The increase in our effective rate reflects certain one-time tax benefits recognized during the third quarter of fiscal 2023.

 Diluted Earnings per Share 
 Diluted earnings per share were 3.67 for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 compared to 3.81 for the third quarter of fiscal 2023. The decrease in diluted earnings per share was primarily driven by lower net earnings during the third quarter of fiscal 2024, slightly offset by lower diluted shares.

 Sales 
 We assess our sales performance by evaluating both net sales and comparable sales. 
 Net Sales. Net sales for the first nine months of fiscal 2024 were 119.8 billion, an increase of 1.6 from 117.9 billion for the first nine months of fiscal 2023. The increase in net sales for the first nine months of fiscal 2024 was primarily driven by SRS, which contributed 4.2 billion of net sales during the first nine months of fiscal 2024, along with net sales from new store openings and the acquisitions we completed in fiscal 2023. This increase in net sales was partially offset by the impact of a negative comparable sales environment, primarily driven by decreases in comparable customer transactions and comparable average ticket. 
 Online sales represented 14.7 of net sales during the first nine months of fiscal 2024 and increased by 3.7 compared to the first nine months of fiscal 2023. 
 A stronger U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales by 47 million for the first nine months of fiscal 2024. 
 Comparable Sales. Total comparable sales for the first nine months of fiscal 2024 decreased 2.5 , reflecting a 1.5 decrease in comparable customer transactions and a 1.2 decrease in comparable average ticket compared to the first nine months of fiscal 2023. The decrease in comparable customer transactions primarily reflects the impact of heightened macroeconomic uncertainties and other macroeconomic factors, including the impacts of a persisting high interest rate environment pressuring home improvement demand. The decrease in comparable average ticket primarily reflects price stabilization relative to last year, slightly offset by demand for new and innovative products. 
 During the first nine months of fiscal 2024, our Power and Building Materials merchandising departments posted positive comparable sales compared to the first nine months of fiscal 2023. All of our other merchandising departments posted negative comparable sales during the first nine months of fiscal 2024 compared to the first nine months of fiscal 2023. 
 Gross Profit 
 Gross profit for the first nine months of fiscal 2024 increased 2.1 to 40.3 billion from 39.5 billion for the first nine months of fiscal 2023. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales, or gross profit margin, was 33.6 for the first nine months of fiscal 2024 compared to 33.5 for the first nine months of fiscal 2023. The increase in gross profit margin reflects lower transportation costs and lower shrink within our Primary segment, partially offset by the inclusion of SRS in our consolidated results. 
 Operating Expenses 
 Our operating expenses are composed of SG A and depreciation and amortization. 
 Selling, General Administrative. SG A for the first nine months of fiscal 2024 increased 1.1 billion, or 5.5 , to 21.0 billion from 19.9 billion for the first nine months of fiscal 2023. As a percentage of net sales, SG A was 17.5 for the first nine months of fiscal 2024 compared to 16.9 for the first nine months of fiscal 2023, which primarily reflects deleverage from a negative comparable sales environment, higher payroll costs and lower legal-related benefits. 
 Depreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization for the first nine months of fiscal 2024 increased 233 million, or 11.7 , to 2.2 billion from 2.0 billion for the first nine months of fiscal 2023. As a percentage of net sales, depreciation and amortization was 1.9 for the first nine months of fiscal 2024 and 1.7 for the first nine months of fiscal 2023, primarily reflecting increased intangible asset amortization expense of 144 million, of which 125 million was related to SRS, as well as increased depreciation expense from ongoing investments in the business. 
 Interest and Other, net 
 Interest and other, net for the first nine months of fiscal 2024 increased 205 million, or 15.7 , to 1.5 billion from 1.3 billion for the first nine months of fiscal 2023. As a percentage of net sales, interest and other, net was 1.3 for the first nine months of fiscal 2024 compared to 1.1 for the first nine months of fiscal 2023, primarily due to higher interest expense driven by higher long-term debt and commercial paper borrowings, partially offset by higher interest income resulting from elevated cash balances in the first half of fiscal 2024 leading up to the acquisition of SRS.

 Provision for Income Taxes 
 Our combined effective income tax rate was 23.9 for the first nine months of fiscal 2024 compared to 24.0 for the first nine months of fiscal 2023. 
 Diluted Earnings per Share 
 Diluted earnings per share were 11.90 for the first nine months of fiscal 2024, compared to 12.28 for the first nine months of fiscal 2023. The decrease in diluted earnings per share was primarily driven by lower net earnings during the first nine months of fiscal 2024, partially offset by lower diluted shares. 
 
 NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES 
 To provide clarity on our operating performance, we supplement our reporting with certain non-GAAP financial measures. However, this supplemental information should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related GAAP measures. Non-GAAP financial measures presented herein may differ from similar measures used by other companies. 
 Return on Invested Capital 
 We believe ROIC is meaningful for management, investors and ratings agencies because it measures how effectively we deploy our capital base. ROIC is a non-GAAP profitability measure, not a measure of financial performance under GAAP. We define ROIC as NOPAT, a non-GAAP financial measure, for the most recent twelve-month period, divided by average debt and equity. We define average debt and equity as the average of beginning and ending long-term debt (including current installments) and equity for the most recent twelve-month period. 
 The following table presents the calculation of ROIC, together with a reconciliation of NOPAT to net earnings (the most comparable GAAP measure):

 (1) Income tax adjustment is defined as operating income multiplied by our effective tax rate for the trailing twelve months. 
 (2) The twelve months ended October 27, 2024 only include operating results for SRS since the acquisition date of June 18, 2024, consistent with our consolidated financial statements.

 At October 27, 2024, we had 1.5 billion in cash and cash equivalents, of which 1.1 billion was held by our foreign subsidiaries. We believe that our current cash position, cash flow generated from operations, funds available from our commercial paper program, and access to the long-term debt capital markets should be sufficient not only for our operating requirements, any required debt payments, and satisfaction of other contractual obligations, but also to enable us to invest in the business, fund dividend payments, and fund any share repurchases through the next several fiscal years. In addition, we believe that we have the ability to obtain alternative sources of financing, if necessary.

 Our material cash requirements include contractual and other obligations arising in the normal course of business. These obligations primarily include long-term debt and related interest payments, operating and finance lease obligations, and purchase obligations. In addition to our cash requirements, we follow a disciplined approach to capital allocation. This approach first prioritizes investing in the business, followed by paying dividends, with the intent of then returning excess cash to shareholders in the form of share repurchases. In March 2024, we paused share repurchases in anticipation of the acquisition of SRS. We do not currently plan to resume share repurchases until we have used our excess cash to reduce our outstanding debt. 
 During the first nine months of fiscal 2024, we invested approximately 2.4 billion back into our business in the form of capital expenditures. For fiscal 2024, in line with our expectation of approximately two percent of net sales on an annual basis, we plan to invest approximately 3.0 billion to 3.5 billion back into our business in the form of capital expenditures, with investments focused on new stores and improving the customer experience, including through technology and development of other differentiated capabilities. However, we may adjust our capital expenditures to support the operations of the business, to enhance long-term strategic positioning, or in response to the economic environment, as necessary or appropriate. 
 In February 2024, we announced a 7.7 increase in our quarterly cash dividend from 2.09 to 2.25 per share. During the first nine months of fiscal 2024, we paid cash dividends of 6.7 billion to shareholders. We intend to pay a dividend in the future; however, any future dividend is subject to declaration by our Board of Directors based on our earnings, capital requirements, financial condition, and other factors considered relevant by our Board of Directors. 
 In August 2023, our Board of Directors approved a 15.0 billion share repurchase authorization that replaced the previous authorization of 15.0 billion, which was approved in August 2022. The August 2023 authorization does not have a prescribed expiration date. As of October 27, 2024, approximately 11.7 billion of the 15.0 billion share repurchase authorization remained available. During the first nine months of fiscal 2024, we had cash payments of 649 million for repurchases of our common stock through open market purchases, prior to pausing share repurchases in March 2024 as discussed above. 
 DEBT 
 At the beginning of fiscal 2024, we had a commercial paper program that allowed for borrowings up to 5.0 billion. In connection with our program, we had back-up credit facilities with a consortium of banks for borrowings up to 5.0 billion, which consisted of a five-year 3.5 billion credit facility scheduled to expire in July 2027 and a 364-day 1.5 billion credit facility scheduled to expire in July 2024. At January 28, 2024, there were no outstanding borrowings under our commercial paper program or back-up credit facilities. 
 In May 2024, we increased our commercial paper program from 5.0 billion to 19.5 billion in connection with the anticipated financing of the acquisition of SRS (see Note 10 for details regarding the SRS acquisition). In May 2024, in connection with the increase in the commercial paper program, we also entered into three additional back-up credit facilities that consisted of a 364-day 3.5 billion credit facility scheduled to expire in May 2025, a three-year 1.0 billion credit facility scheduled to expire in May 2027, and a 364-day 10.0 billion credit facility scheduled to expire in May 2025. The 10.0 billion credit facility also provided that the commitments and any borrowings under that facility would be reduced by the amount of net cash proceeds we received from any future debt issuance. 
 In June 2024, leading up to the acquisition of SRS on June 18, 2024, we raised commercial paper borrowings of over 15.0 billion to fund the transaction. On June 25, 2024, we received the proceeds from the issuance of 10.0 billion of long-term debt, and immediately used the proceeds to repay approximately 10.0 billion of these commercial paper borrowings. On June 27, 2024, we terminated the 10.0 billion back-up credit facility, and subsequently reduced our commercial paper program from 19.5 billion to 9.5 billion. 
 In July 2024, we completed the renewal of our 364-day 1.5 billion credit facility, extending the maturity from July 2024 to July 2025. As of October 27, 2024, our commercial paper program allowed for borrowings up to 9.5 billion and is supported by 9.5 billion of back-up credit facilities. 
 All of our short-term borrowings in the first nine months of fiscal 2024 were under our commercial paper program, and the maximum amount outstanding at any time was 15.3 billion. At October 27, 2024, we had outstanding borrowings under our commercial paper program of 1.3 billion with a weighted average interest rate of 4.8 , we had no outstanding borrowings under our back-up credit facilities, and we were in compliance with all of the covenants contained in our credit facilities, none of which are expected to impact our liquidity or capital resources.

Table of Contents 

 We also issue senior notes from time to time as part of our capital management strategy. As discussed above, in June 2024, we issued 10.0 billion of senior notes in connection with the funding of the acquisition of SRS. Separately, in February 2024, we repaid 1.1 billion of senior notes at maturity. 
 The indentures governing our senior notes do not generally limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness or require us to maintain financial ratios or specified levels of net worth or liquidity. The indentures governing our notes contain various customary covenants; however, none of the covenants are expected to impact our liquidity or capital resources. See Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our debt arrangements. 
 CASH FLOWS SUMMARY 
 Operating Activities 
 Cash flow generated from operations provides us with a significant source of liquidity. Our operating cash flows result primarily from cash received from our customers, offset by cash payments we make for products and services, associate compensation, operations, occupancy costs, and income taxes. Cash provided by or used in operating activities is also subject to changes in working capital. Working capital at any point in time is subject to many variables, including seasonality, inventory management and category expansion, the timing of cash receipts and payments, vendor payment terms, and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. 
 Net cash provided by operating activities decreased by 1.3 billion in the first nine months of fiscal 2024 compared to the first nine months of fiscal 2023, primarily due to changes in working capital. Changes in working capital were primarily driven by more normalized inventory levels during the first nine months of fiscal 2024 compared to strategic reductions in inventory during fiscal 2023, as well as timing of vendor payments, each within our Primary segment. 
 Investing Activities 
 Net cash used in investing activities increased by 16.8 billion in the first nine months of fiscal 2024 compared to the first nine months of fiscal 2023, primarily due to higher cash payments for business acquisitions in fiscal 2024, including 17.6 billion of cash consideration paid to acquire SRS, net of cash acquired. 
 Financing Activities 
 Net cash provided by financing activities in the first nine months of fiscal 2024 primarily reflected approximately 10.0 billion of net proceeds from long-term debt and 1.3 billion of proceeds from commercial paper borrowings, net of repayments, partially offset by 6.7 billion of cash dividends paid, 1.4 billion of repayments of long-term debt, and 649 million of share repurchases prior to pausing share repurchases in March 2024. Net cash used in financing activities in the first nine months of fiscal 2023 primarily reflected 6.5 billion of share repurchases, 6.3 billion of cash dividends paid, and 1.2 billion of long-term debt repayments. 
 The overall increase in cash flows from financing activities during the first nine months of fiscal 2024 compared to the first nine months of fiscal 2023 totaled 16.6 billion and was predominantly attributable to the financing of the SRS acquisition. Specifically, as discussed above, a combination of commercial paper borrowings and the 10.0 billion long-term debt issuance, along with increased cash on hand resulting from the pause of share repurchases, were utilized in connection with the SRS acquisition.

 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES 
 During the first nine months of fiscal 2024, there were no changes to our critical accounting estimates or our significant accounting policies as disclosed in the 2023 Form 10-K, except as set forth below. Our significant accounting policies are disclosed in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements. 
 Business Combinations 
 We account for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires that once control is obtained, all the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at their respective fair values at the date of acquisition. The determination of fair values of identifiable assets and liabilities requires estimates and the use of valuation techniques when fair value is not readily available and requires a significant amount of management judgment. For the valuation of intangible assets acquired in a business combination, we typically use an income approach. Specifically, for the SRS acquisition, we used the multi-period excess earnings method to value the customer relationships intangible assets. The significant assumptions used to estimate the fair values of customer relationships included forecasted revenues, expected customer attrition rates, and discount rates. Although the Company believes its estimates of fair value are reasonable, actual financial results could differ from those estimates due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making such estimates. Changes in assumptions concerning future financial results or other underlying assumptions could have a significant impact on the determination of the fair values of the customer relationships intangible assets acquired. 
 The excess of the purchase price over fair values of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill. During the measurement period, which is up to one year from the acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill due to the use of preliminary information in our initial estimates. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to earnings. 
 ADDITIONAL INFORMATION 
 For information on accounting pronouncements that have impacted or are expected to materially impact our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows, see Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements. 
 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. 
 Our exposure to market risk results primarily from fluctuations in interest rates in connection with our long-term debt portfolio. We are also exposed to risks from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of our foreign operations into U.S. dollars and on the purchase of goods by these foreign operations that are not denominated in their local currencies. Additionally, we may experience inflation and deflation related to our purchase and sale of certain commodity products. During the first nine months of fiscal 2024, there have been no material changes to our exposure to market risks from those disclosed in the 2023 Form 10-K, including the types of instruments we use to manage our exposure to such risks. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 Under the direction and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we evaluated our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) and concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of October 27, 2024. 
 We are in the process of an ongoing business transformation initiative, which includes upgrading and migrating certain accounting and finance systems. We plan to continue to migrate additional business processes over the course of the next few years and have modified and will continue to modify the design and implementation of certain internal control processes as the transformation continues. 
 Except as described above, there were no other changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the fiscal quarter ended October 27, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 
 PART II OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings. 
 Except as set forth in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended July 28, 2024 as filed with the SEC on August 20, 2024, there were no material changes during the first nine months of fiscal 2024 to our disclosure in Part I, Item 3. Legal Proceedings of our 2023 Form 10-K.

 SEC regulations require us to disclose certain information about proceedings arising under federal, state or local environmental regulations if we reasonably believe that such proceedings may result in monetary sanctions above a stated threshold. Pursuant to SEC regulations, the Company uses a threshold of 1 million for purposes of determining whether disclosure of any such proceedings is required. 
 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors. 
 In addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the factors discussed under Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors and elsewhere in the 2023 Form 10-K. These risks and uncertainties could materially and adversely affect our business, consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. Our operations could also be affected by additional factors that are not presently known to us or by factors that we currently do not consider material to our business. There have been no material changes in the risk factors discussed in the 2023 Form 10-K.

 (1) These amounts include repurchases pursuant to our Omnibus Stock Incentive Plan, as Amended and Restated May 19, 2022, and our 1997 Omnibus Stock Incentive Plan (collectively, the Plans ). Under the Plans, participants surrender shares as payment of applicable tax withholding on the vesting of restricted stock. Participants in the Plans may also exercise stock options by surrendering shares of common stock that the participants already own as payment of the exercise price. Shares so surrendered by participants in the Plans are repurchased pursuant to the terms of the Plans and applicable award agreement and not pursuant to publicly announced share repurchase programs. 
 (2) On August 14, 2023, our Board of Directors approved a 15.0 billion share repurchase authorization that replaced the previous authorization of 15.0 billion, which was approved on August 18, 2022. The August 2023 authorization does not have a prescribed expiration date. As previously disclosed, we paused share repurchases in March 2024. 
 (3) Excludes excise taxes incurred on share repurchases. 
 SALES OF UNREGISTERED SECURITIES 
 During the third quarter of fiscal 2024, we issued 480 deferred stock units under The Home Depot, Inc. Nonemployee Directors Deferred Stock Compensation Plan pursuant to the exemption from registration provided by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act and Rule 506 of the SEC s Regulation D thereunder. The deferred stock units were credited during the third quarter of fiscal 2024 to the accounts of those non-employee directors who elected to receive all or a portion of board retainers in the form of deferred stock units instead of cash. The deferred stock units convert to shares of common stock on a one-for-one basis following a termination of service as described in this plan. 
 During the third quarter of fiscal 2024, we credited 876 deferred stock units to participant accounts under the Restoration Plans pursuant to an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act for involuntary, non-contributory plans. The deferred stock units convert to shares of common stock on a one-for-one basis following a termination of service as described in these plans. 
 
 Item 5. Other Information.
