The
Company s current operations concentrate around land development projects, included in our only reporting segment real
estate. In determination of segments, the Company, together with its chief operating decision maker, who is also our Co-CEO, consider
factors that include the nature of business activities, allocation of resources and management structure. 

The
Company was also in the business of renting homes, however, on December 9, 2022, Alset EHome entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement
with Alset International Limited and Alset Inc., pursuant to which Alset EHome agreed to sell all of the shares of American Home REIT

, compared to as of December 31, 2023. 

Alset
EHome s Lakes at Black Oak project is a land sub-division development located north of Houston, Texas. Our Lakes at Black Oak project
initially consisted of acres; in January of 2021, this project was expanded with the purchase of an approximately -acre tract
of land. The future development timeline of Lakes at
Black Oak will be based on multiple conditions, including the amount of funds which may be raised from capital markets, the loans we
may secure from third party financial institutions, and government reimbursements which may be received. The development will be step
by step and expenses will be contingent on the amount of funding we will receive. 

In
late 2022 and early 2023, the Company entered into three contracts with builders to sell multiple lots from its Lakes at Black Oak project.
The sales contemplated by these contracts were contingent on certain conditions which the parties to such contracts had to meet and generated
approximately million of funds from operations, not including certain expenses that the Company was required to pay. In addition,
the Company is entitled to receive certain reimbursements in the year ended December 31, 2024 and 2025. The sale of lots closed in
the first six months of 2023 generating approximately million revenue. The sale of lots closed on January 4, 2024, generating
approximately million in revenue. 

On
July 1, 2024, the Company has closed the sale of single-family detached residential lots comprising a section of Lakes at Black Oak
to Century Land Holdings of Texas, LLC. The lots were sold at a fixed per-lot price, and the Seller also received a community enhancement
fee for each lot sold. The aggregate purchase price and community enhancement fees, minus certain expenses, equaled a combined total
of approximately million. 

The
Company has obtained a letter of financial support from Alset Inc., an indirect owner of the Company. Alset Inc. committed to provide
any additional funding required by the Company and would not demand repayment for the next twelve months from the filing of this Form
10-Q. There is no guarantee that we will be able to execute on our plans as laid out above. 

These
financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or amounts

revenue is subject to an evaluation for collectability on several factors, including payment history, the financial strength of the tenant

these factors indicates that it is not probable that we will recover substantially all of the receivable, rental revenue is limited to
the lesser of the rental revenue that would be recognized on a straight-line basis (as applicable) or the lease payments that have been
collected from the lessee. Differences between rental revenue recognized and amounts contractually due under the lease agreements are

Revenue 

Revenue
was 3,827,902 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 6,300 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The
increase in revenue in the three month period is mainly caused by the increase in property sales from the Lakes at Black Oak project
in the three months ended September 30, 2024. Revenue was 8,886,207 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 18,197,250
for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in revenue in the nine month period is mainly caused by the decrease in property
sales from the Lakes at Black Oak project in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

In
late 2022 and early 2023, the Company entered into three contracts with builders to sell multiple lots from its Lakes at Black Oak project.
The sales contemplated by these contracts were contingent on certain conditions which the parties to such contracts had to meet and were
expected to generate approximately 23 million of funds from operations, not including certain expenses that the Company was required
to pay. The sale of 335 lots closed in the first six months of 2023 generating approximately 18.1 million revenue. The sale of remaining
lots closed on January 4, 2024 generating approximately 5.0 million revenue. 

On
November 13, 2023, the Company entered into two contracts with
builders to sell multiple lots from its Lakes at Black Oak and Alset Villa projects. The closing
of these transactions depends on the satisfaction of certain conditions. The sale of the first 70 lots
closed on July 1, 2024 generating approximately 3.8 million. The sale of the remaining 72
lots closed on October 10, 2024 generating approximately 3.9 million.

and 10,500 in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

homes lease agreements. The gross margin ratio for Lakes at Black Oak project in the first nine months of 2024 and 2023 was approximately
37 and 40 , respectively. The increase in cost of revenue in the three month period is caused by the increase in property sales from
the Lake at Black Oak project in 2024.The decrease in cost of revenue and decrease in gross margin in the nine month period is caused
by the decrease in property sales from the Lakes at Black Oak project in 2024. The gross margin ratio for AHR Black Oak Lease Agreement
in the first nine months of 2024 and 2023 was approximately 58 and 25 , respectively.

from decrease in bonus paid to a certain consultant.

compared to other income of 365,087 in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The
increase in other income was caused by increase in interest income from related party promissory note and reduction in interest expense,
as the Company s loan from related party was repaid during 2023.

to 2,025,992 at September 30, 2024. This decrease is primarily caused by the reduction in accounts payable and accrued expenses. Our
