 Transactional Services and Other Total Revenues 
 
 Deferred Revenues 
 The net increase in the deferred revenue balance for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily driven by the amounts due from customers in advance of satisfying the Company's performance obligations of million for current year invoices and million from the netting of contract assets and liabilities on a contract-by-contract basis, partially offset by the recognition of million of revenue recognized from current year invoices and million of revenue that was included in the deferred revenue balance as of December 31, 2023. Amounts recognized from deferred revenues represent primarily revenue from the sale of subscription and implementation services. 
 Remaining Performance Obligations 
 On September 30, 2024, the Company had billion of remaining performance obligations, which represents contracted revenue minimums that have not yet been recognized, including amounts that will be invoiced and recognized as revenue in future periods. The Company expects to recognize approximately of its remaining performance obligations as revenue in the next months, in the next to months, and the balance thereafter. 
 Allowance for Credit Losses 
 The Company is exposed to credit losses primarily through sales of products and services. The Company assesses the collectability of outstanding contract assets on an ongoing basis and maintains a reserve which is included in the allowance for credit losses for contract assets deemed uncollectible. The Company analyzes the contract assets portfolio for significant risks by considering historical collection experience and forecasting future collectability to determine the amount of revenues that will ultimately be collected from its customers. Customer type (whether a customer is a financial institution or other digital solution provider) has been identified as the primary specific risk affecting the Company's contract assets, and the estimate for losses is analyzed quarterly and adjusted as necessary. Future collectability may be impacted by current and anticipated economic conditions that could impact the Company's customers. Additionally, specific allowance amounts may be established to record the appropriate provision for customers that have a higher probability of default. The Company has provisioned and million for expected losses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and charges were taken against the allowance at either September 30, 2024 or 2023. The allowance for credit losses related to contract assets was million at both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

 impairments for credit losses were recognized during either of the three months ended September 30, 2024 or 2023. 
 The Company has invested in a private financial technology investment fund, classified as an equity investment. Equity investments without a readily determinable fair value, where the Company has no influence over the operating and financial policies of the investee, are recorded at cost, less impairment and adjusted for subsequent observable price changes obtained from orderly transactions for identical or similar investments issued by the same investee. An impairment charge to current earnings is recorded when the cost of the investment exceeds its fair value and this condition is determined to be other-than-temporary. During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company determined there was a million other-than-temporary impairment on its equity investment. This equity investment had a carrying amount of million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company's cash was million and million, respectively.

 Investments may be sold or may settle at any time, without significant penalty, for use in current operations or for other purposes, even if they have not yet reached maturity. As a result, the Company classifies its investments, including investments with maturities beyond twelve months, as current assets on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. 
 Due after one year through two years 
 The Company has certain available-for-sale debt investments in a gross unrealized loss position. The Company regularly reviews its debt investments for impairment resulting from credit loss using both qualitative and quantitative criteria, as necessary, based on the composition of the portfolio at period end. The Company considers factors such as the length of time and extent to which the market value has been less than the cost, the financial position and near-term prospects of the issuer or whether the Company has the intent to or it is more likely than not it will be required to sell the investments before recovery of the investments' amortized-cost basis. If the Company determines that impairment exists in one of these investments, the respective investments would be written down to fair value. For debt securities, the portion of the write-down related to credit loss would be recognized in other income, net on the condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive loss if the intent of the Company was to sell the investments before recovery. Any portion not related to credit loss would be included in accumulated other comprehensive loss in the condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive loss. Because the Company does not intend to sell any investments which have an unrealized loss position at this time, and it is not more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the investment before recovery of its amortized cost basis, which may be maturity, the reserve for available-for-sale debt securities was as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

 million principal amount of convertible senior notes due in June 2026, or the 2026 Notes. Interest is payable semi-annually on June 1 and December 1 of each year, commencing on December 1, 2019. 
 In November 2020, the Company issued million principal amount of convertible senior notes due in November 2025, or the 2025 Notes. Interest is payable semi-annually on May 15 and November 15 of each year, commencing on May 15, 2021. 
 In March 2023, the Company repurchased million in aggregate principal amount of the 2026 Notes for million in cash and repurchased million in aggregate principal amount of the 2025 Notes for million in cash. The partial repurchases of the 2026 Notes and 2025 Notes resulted in a million gain on early debt extinguishment, of which million consisted of unamortized debt issuance costs. This gain was recorded within other income on the condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive loss. The Company may repurchase additional 2025 Notes and/or 2026 Notes from time to time through open market purchases, block trades, and/or privately negotiated transactions, in compliance with applicable securities laws and other legal requirements. The timing, volume, and nature of the repurchases will be determined by the Company based on the capital needs of the business, market conditions, applicable legal requirements, and other factors. 
 The Notes are the Company's senior unsecured obligations and rank senior in right of payment to any of the Company's indebtedness that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Notes, rank equally in right of payment with any of the Company's indebtedness that is not so subordinated, are effectively junior in right of payment to any of the Company's secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness and are structurally junior to all indebtedness and other liabilities (including trade payables) of the Company's current and future subsidiaries. 
 On or after June 5, 2023 or November 20, 2023 for the 2026 Notes and 2025 Notes, respectively, the Company may redeem for cash all or any portion of the Notes, at the Company's option, if the last reported sale price of the Company's common stock has been at least of the conversion price in effect for at least trading days (whether or not consecutive) during any -consecutive trading-day period. If the Company calls any or all of the Notes for redemption, holders may convert all or any portion of their Notes at any time prior to the close of business on the scheduled trading day prior to the redemption date, even if the Notes are not otherwise convertible at such time. After that time, the right to convert such Notes will expire, unless the Company defaults in the payment of the redemption price, in which case a holder of the Notes may convert all or any portion of its Notes until the redemption price has been paid or duly provided for. 
 On or after March 1, 2026 or August 15, 2025 for the 2026 Notes and 2025 Notes, respectively, holders may convert all or any portion of their Notes at any time prior to the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date, regardless of the succeeding conditions described herein. Upon conversion, the Company will pay or deliver cash, shares of its common stock or a combination of cash and shares of its common stock, at its election, as described in the indentures governing the Notes. 
 Holders may convert their Notes at their option at any time prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding March 1, 2026 or August 15, 2025 for the 2026 Notes and 2025 Notes, respectively, only under the following circumstances: 
 during any calendar quarter commencing after the calendar quarter ending on September 30, 2019 or March 30, 2021 (and only during such calendar quarter), for the 2026 Notes and 2025 Notes, respectively, if the last reported sale price of the common stock for at least trading days (whether or not consecutive) during a period of consecutive trading days ending on, and including, the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter is greater than or equal to of the conversion price on each applicable trading day; 
 during the consecutive business day period after any consecutive trading day period in which the trading price per 1,000 principal amount of the Notes for each trading day of the measurement period was less than of the product of the last reported sale price of the Company's common stock and the conversion rate on each such trading day; or 
 upon the occurrence of specified corporate events.

 of the principal amount of the Notes, plus any accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date. 
 Unamortized debt issuance costs ) ) ) ) Net carrying amount 
 As of September 30, 2024, the 2026 Notes and 2025 Notes were not convertible. As of September 30, 2024, the if-converted value of the Notes did not exceed the principal amount. The if-converted values were determined based on the closing price of the Company's stock on September 30, 2024. 
 Capped Call Transactions 
 In connection with the issuance of the Notes, the Company entered into separate capped call transactions with one or more counterparties, or the Capped Calls. The Capped Calls associated with the 2026 Notes have an initial strike price of per share, subject to certain adjustments, which corresponds to the initial conversion price of the 2026 Notes. The Capped Calls associated with the 2025 Notes have an initial strike price of per share, subject to certain adjustments, which corresponds to the initial conversion price of the 2025 Notes. The Capped Calls associated with the 2026 Notes have an initial cap price of per share. The Capped Calls associated with the 2025 Notes have an initial cap price of per share. The Capped Calls are expected to offset the potential dilution to the common stock upon any conversion of the Notes and/or offset any cash payments the Company is required to make in excess of the principal amount of the Notes in the event the market price per share of common stock is greater than the strike price of the Capped Call, with such offset subject to a cap. If, however, the market price per share of the common stock exceeds the cap price of the Capped Calls, there would be dilution and/or there would not be an offset of such potential cash payments, in each case, to the extent that the then-market price per share of the common stock exceeds the cap price. As the Capped Calls are considered indexed to the Company's stock and are considered equity classified, they are recorded in stockholders' equity on the condensed consolidated balance sheet and are not accounted for as derivatives. The cost of million incurred in connection with the Capped Calls associated with the 2026 Notes was recorded as a reduction to additional paid-in capital. The cost of million incurred in connection with the Capped Calls associated with the 2025 Notes was recorded as a reduction to common stock. 
 In March 2023, in connection with the partial repurchase of the Notes, the Company terminated the Capped Calls in a notional amount corresponding to the aggregate principal amount of the Notes that were repurchased. As a result of the termination of the related Capped Calls, the Company received cash payments of million. The proceeds were recorded as an increase to additional paid-in capital on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. 
 Revolving Credit Agreement 
 On July 29, 2024, the Company entered into a secured Revolving Credit Agreement with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, Wells Fargo Securities, LLC and Texas Capital Bank. The Revolving Credit Agreement provides for a revolving line of credit of up to million, which may be drawn upon as revolving loans, swingline loans or letter of credit issuances, with sublimits (i) in the case of swingline loans, in an amount up to million and (ii) in the case of letters of credit, in an amount up to million. Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Agreement may, at the Company's election, bear interest quarterly at either (a) the base rate plus the applicable margin ("Base Rate Loans"), or (b) the adjusted term secured overnight financing rate (the "SOFR"), plus the applicable margin (the "Adjusted Term SOFR Loans"). The applicable margin ranges from to per annum for Base Rate Loans and to per annum for Adjusted Term SOFR loans. A commitment fee accrues at a rate ranging from to per annum, based on the Company's consolidated total net leverage ratio, of the average daily unused portion of the commitment of the lenders.

 Amortization of debt issuance costs Total 
 Debt issuance costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the expected life of the Notes and the Revolving Credit Agreement, respectively. For the Notes, the straight-line basis approximates the effective interest method. As of September 30, 2024, the remaining period over which the debt issuance costs will be amortized for the 2026 Notes and 2025 Notes was years and years, respectively.

 shares of common stock that were reserved for issuance pursuant to outstanding awards, assuming maximum performance for any performance-based awards, under the 2014 Plan. 
 In May 2023, the Company's stockholders approved the 2023 Equity Incentive Plan, or 2023 Plan, with an effective date of June 1, 2023, under which stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance shares and units and other cash-based or stock-based awards may be granted to employees, consultants and directors. At time of approval, up to shares of common stock were reserved for issuance under the 2023 Plan, all of which consisted of shares previously reserved for issuance under the 2014 Plan and any shares that would otherwise be returned to the 2014 Plan as a result of the forfeiture, repurchase or termination of awards issued under that plan. The 2023 Plan is a successor to and continuation of the Company s 2014 Plan. As of September 30, 2024, shares remain authorized and available for future issuance under the 2023 Plan, assuming attainment of maximum performance for any market stock units or performance stock units. 
 In March 2014, the Company adopted its Employee Stock Purchase Plan, or ESPP. The plan was implemented starting January 3, 2022, pursuant to which certain participating domestic employees are able to purchase shares of the Company's common stock at a discount of the lower of the market price at the beginning or end of the applicable offering period. Offering periods commence on each June 1 and December 1. The Board provided for a share reserve with respect to the ESPP of shares. The ESPP contains a provision that automatically increases the shares available for issuance under the plan on January 1 of each year through 2024, by an amount equal to the lesser of (a) shares, (b) of the number of shares issued and outstanding on the immediately preceding December 31, or (c) such other amount as may be determined by the Company's board of directors. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company issued shares and as of September 30, 2024, shares remain authorized and available for future issuance under the ESPP.

For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company's effective tax rate was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate primarily due to its valuation allowance offsetting the benefits of losses. The Company's income tax expenses and benefits consist primarily of state current income tax expense, deferred income tax expense relating to the tax amortization of previously acquired goodwill and current income tax expense from foreign operations. 
 To date, the Company has provided a valuation allowance against most of its deferred tax assets as it believes the objective and verifiable evidence of its historical pretax net losses outweighs any positive evidence of its forecasted future results. The Company will continue to monitor the positive and negative evidence, and it will adjust the valuation allowance as sufficient objective positive evidence becomes available.

 Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 
 The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our interim condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in our other SEC filings, including the audited consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, which are included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the SEC on February 21, 2024. In addition to historical condensed consolidated financial information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, particularly in the sections titled "Risk Factors" and "Special Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements," which include a discussion of the uncertainties, risks and assumptions associated with these statements. The following discussion and analysis also includes a discussion of certain non-GAAP financial measures. For a description and reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures discussed in this section, see "Non-GAAP Financial Measures." 
 
 Overview 
 We are a leading provider of digital banking and lending solutions to financial institutions, financial technology companies, or FinTechs, and alternative finance companies, or Alt-FIs, wanting to incorporate banking into their customer engagement and servicing strategies. Our solutions transform the ways in which financial institutions and other financial services providers engage with account holders and end users, or End Users. Our solutions include a broad and deep portfolio of digital banking solutions; digital lending and relationship pricing solutions; an open technology platform, the Q2 Innovation Studio, which is a portfolio of technologies and programs which can be leveraged to design, develop, and distribute innovative products, services, features, and integrations by enabling a partnership ecosystem on Q2's digital banking platform; and Helix, a cloud-native core that also serves as a comprehensive banking as a service, or BaaS, solution, both of which enable innovative companies and financial institutions to integrate unique banking products and services into their offerings. We purpose-build our platforms and solutions to enable success for our customers and technology partners by allowing them to digitize their operations and offerings, differentiate their digital brands, integrate traditional and emerging financial services, and ultimately, enhance their End User acquisition, engagement and retention and improve their operational efficiencies and profitability. 
 Significant resources, personnel and expertise are required to effectively deliver and manage advanced digital banking and lending solutions in the complex and heavily regulated financial services industry. We provide digital solutions that are designed to be highly configurable, scalable and adaptable to the specific needs of our customers. We design and develop our solutions with an open platform approach intended to provide comprehensive integration among our solution offerings and our customers' internal and third-party systems. This integrated approach allows our customers to deliver unified and robust financial experiences across digital channels. Our solutions provide our customers the flexibility to configure their digital services in a manner that is consistent with each customer's specific offerings, workflows, processes and controls. Our solutions also allow our customers to personalize the digital experiences they deliver to their End Users by extending their individual services and brand requirements across digital channels. Our solutions and our data center infrastructure and resources are designed to comply with the stringent security and technical regulations applicable to financial institutions and financial services providers and to safeguard our customers' data and that of their End Users. 
 We have deep domain expertise in developing and delivering advanced digital banking and lending solutions designed to help our customers and technology partners compete in the complex and heavily regulated financial services industry. Over 20 years ago, Q2 began by providing digital banking solutions to domestic regional and community financial institutions, or RCFIs. We have rapidly grown since then through a combination of broad market acceptance of our award-winning solutions and relentless innovation, investment and acquisitions. Our collection of solutions now spans digital banking, digital lending and relationship pricing, digital account opening, regulatory and compliance, account switching, data-driven sales enablement, spending insights and portfolio management, and we serve account holders and borrowers across retail, small to medium business, or SMB, and commercial segments domestically and outside of the U.S. In addition to our open platform solutions and BaaS offerings, we also offer a suite of risk and fraud solutions designed to assist our customers in their effort to safeguard the financial service offerings against fraudulent activities. While we remain focused on our founding mission of building stronger and more diverse communities by strengthening their financial institutions, we intend to draw on our broad product portfolio and deep domain expertise to both further penetrate the digital banking market and drive meaningful expansion activity within our robust customer base across financial services.

 The financial services industry is experiencing significant transformation driven by the growing demand within financial institutions to digitize their operations and offerings, as well as the rise of FinTechs and Alt-FIs, which are reshaping End User expectations for more innovative and engaging digital financial experiences. These shifts are leading to new roles and interdependencies among financial institutions, FinTechs and Alt-FIs, necessitating new technology, partnerships, and business models. We believe that lasting value creation in financial services will be achieved by those companies that are capable of supporting and enhancing this convergence. We have developed a comprehensive suite of solutions to accelerate and optimize this convergence, ranging from digitizing entire banks to facilitating partnerships between financial institutions, FinTechs, and Alt-FIs. 
 We deliver our solutions to most of our customers using a software-as-a-service, or SaaS, model under which our customers pay subscription fees for the use of our solutions. Our digital banking platform customers have numerous End Users, and those End Users can represent one or more account holders registered to use one or more of our solutions on our digital banking platform. We generally price our digital banking platform solutions based on the number of solutions purchased by our customers and the number of Registered Users, as defined in "Key Operating Measures" below, or commercial account holders utilizing our solutions. We generally earn additional revenues from our digital banking platform customers based on the number of End Users on our solutions, the number of transactions that End Users perform on our solutions, and the excess number of users and transactions above what is included in our standard subscription fee. As a result, our revenues from digital banking platform customers grow as our customers buy more solutions from us and increase the number of End Users utilizing our solutions and as those users increase their number of transactions on our solutions. The structure and terms of our digital lending and relationship pricing arrangements vary, but generally are also sold on a subscription basis through our direct sales organization, and the related revenues are recognized over the terms of the customer agreements. The structure and terms of our Helix arrangements with FinTechs vary, but typically involve relatively lower contracted minimum revenues and instead emphasize usage-based revenue, with such revenue recognized as it is incurred. 
 We believe we have the opportunity to continue to grow our business and that the investments we are making are positioning us to continue to realize revenue growth and improve our operating efficiencies. These investments will increase our costs on an absolute dollar basis, but the timing and amount of these investments will vary based on the rate at which we expect to add new customers, the implementation and support needs of our customers, our software development plans, our technology and physical infrastructure requirements and the internal needs of our organization. Many of these investments will occur in advance of any associated benefit. If we are successful in growing our revenues by selling additional innovative solutions to existing customers and creating deeper End User engagement, we anticipate that greater economies of scale and increased operating leverage will improve our margins over the long term. 
 We primarily sell our solutions through our direct sales organization. While the financial institutions market is well-defined due to the regulatory classifications of those financial institutions, markets for FinTechs and Alt-FIs are broader and more difficult to define due to the changing number of providers in each market. Over the long term, we intend to continue to invest in additional sales representatives to identify and address opportunities in the financial institution, FinTech and Alt-FI markets across the U.S. and internationally and to increase our number of sales support and marketing personnel, as well as our investment in marketing initiatives designed to increase awareness of our solutions and generate new customer opportunities. 
 We have continuously invested in expanding and improving our digital banking platform since we introduced it in 2005, and we intend to continue investing organically and to selectively pursue acquisitions of and strategic investments in technologies that will strengthen and expand the features and functionality of our solutions and provide access to new customers and new markets. Additionally, over the past several years we have acquired or developed new solutions and additional functionality that serve a broader range of needs of financial institutions as well as the needs of FinTechs and Alt-FIs. Our integrated, end-to-end collection of solutions includes retail, SMB and commercial banking, regulatory and compliance, digital lending and relationship pricing, open platform solutions, BaaS, digital account opening, account switching and data-driven sales enablement, spending insights and portfolio management solutions among others. We believe our solutions afford us a distinct competitive advantage, servicing retail, SMB and commercial needs and reflect the culmination of years of strategic development and innovation which in turn has solidified our competitive market position. We have also introduced the Q2 Innovation Studio, an API-based and SDK-based open technology platform that allows our financial institution customers and other technology partners to develop unique extensions of and integrations to our digital banking platform, allowing financial institutions to quickly and easily deploy customized experiences and the latest financial services expected by End Users.

 We believe that financial services providers are best served by a broad integrated portfolio of digital solutions that provide rapid, flexible and comprehensive integration with internal and third-party solutions allowing them to provide modern, intuitive, advanced and regulatory-compliant digital banking and lending services. We also believe that the breadth and depth of our solution offerings and customer base, our open and flexible platform approach, our position as a leading provider of digital banking solutions to a large network of financial institutions, and our expertise in delivering new, advanced, innovative and regulatory-compliant digital banking and lending solutions uniquely position us to capitalize on the evolving needs and challenges within the financial services industry, enabling us to effectively innovate and adapt our offerings to meet the ever-changing demands of our customers and their End Users. We intend to increase investments in technology innovation and software development as we enhance our solutions and platforms and increase or expand the number of solutions that we offer. 
 As our business grows, we intend to continue to invest in and grow our services and delivery organization to support our customers' needs, help them through their digital transformation, deliver our solutions in a timely and effective manner and maintain our strong reputation. We believe that delivery of consistent, high-quality customer support is a significant driver of purchasing and renewal decisions of our prospects and customers. To develop and maintain a reputation for high-quality service, we seek to build deep relationships with our customers through our customer service organization, which we staff with personnel who are motivated by our common mission of using technology to help our customers succeed and who are knowledgeable with respect to the regulated and complex nature of the financial services industry. 
 Recent Events 
 There continues to be widespread geopolitical and global economic uncertainties, some of which are impacting business and consumer behavior. We believe various factors including high and shifting interest rates, inflation rates, tight labor markets, wage inflation, geopolitical uncertainty, recession fears and other economic conditions continue to put pressure on some corporate IT expenditures. Persistent elevated interest rates or any future increase in interest rates may reduce account holder demand for loans and can reduce the creditworthiness of existing borrowers, resulting in operational challenges for financial institutions, including higher credit losses and difficulty in assessing risk in their existing loan portfolios and in making new lending decisions. A significant portion of our revenues is derived from sales of our digital banking platform to U.S. based RCFIs, which have and may continue to be impacted by challenges in the economic environment and financial services industry. However, we believe that higher interest rates also have increased the importance for financial institutions to attract and retain depository relationships, which we believe has increased demand for our digital banking solutions. In recent periods we have observed improved subscription bookings and associated revenue primarily from our digital banking solutions as a result of banking conditions placing an importance on attracting and retaining deposits. 
 Some financial institutions have in the past experienced significant pressure due to economic uncertainty, liquidity concerns and increased regulatory scrutiny. In recent years, many financial institutions have merged or been acquired, and periodically during downturns, a limited number of financial institutions have failed, creating market disruption and uncertainty for the financial services industry, in particular among RCFIs. The actions taken by such institutions to address potential liquidity concerns have resulted in certain institutions incurring substantial costs that have negatively impacted, and may continue to negatively impact, their profitability and could lead to further market instability or bank failures. Additionally, regulatory changes aimed at stabilizing the financial system could impose new burdens, further straining the profitability of these institutions and potentially leading to a contraction in economic activities. The current market conditions, including deteriorating performance of loan portfolios, capital constraints due to more stringent reserve requirements, and elevated levels of direct losses and charge-offs for some financial institutions, have also caused and may continue to cause financial institutions to reduce lending activity as they seek to increase their reserves to maintain better liquidity. Additionally, banking regulators, alongside increasingly cautious investors, have increased scrutiny of commercial real estate lending. This heightened attention may compel financial institutions with substantial commercial real estate loan portfolios to adopt more stringent underwriting standards, enhance internal controls, bolster risk management policies, conduct more rigorous portfolio stress testing, and maintain higher reserve levels. While the U.S. government has taken measures to strengthen public confidence in the banking system and protect depositors, such steps may be insufficient to resolve the volatility in the financial markets and reduce the risk of additional bank failures. The duration and severity of these general economic conditions and their long-term effects on us and our customers remain uncertain and difficult to predict. Refer to "Special Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements" above for further discussion of the impact and possible future impacts of general economic uncertainty and the current challenges facing the financial services industry on our business.

 Key Operating Measures 
 In addition to the U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, measures described below in "Components of Operating Results," we monitor the following operating measures to evaluate growth trends, plan investments and measure the effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts. 
 Installed Customers 
 We define Installed Customers as the number of customers on live implementations (or installations) of our digital banking platforms. The average size of our Installed Customers, measured in both Registered Users per Installed Customer and revenues per Installed Customer, has increased over time as our existing Installed Customers continue to add Registered Users and commercial account holders, buy more solutions from us, and as we add larger financial institutions to our Installed Customer base. The net rate at which we add Installed Customers varies based on our implementation capacity, the size and unique needs of our customers, the readiness of our customers to implement our solutions and customer attrition, including as a result of merger and acquisition activity among financial institutions. We had 450, 444 and 448 Installed Customers on our digital banking platform as of December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 
 Registered Users 
 We define a Registered User as an individual related to an account holder of an Installed Customer on our consumer digital banking platform who has registered to use one or more of our digital banking solutions and has current access to use those solutions as of the last day of the reporting period presented. Our average number of Registered Users per Installed Customer grows as our existing digital banking platform customers add more Registered Users and as we add larger financial institutions to our Installed Customer base. We anticipate that the number of Registered Users will grow at a faster rate than our number of Installed Customers, however this will be partially offset as our commercial digital banking platform represents a greater proportion of our Installed Customers solutions without the associated Registered User impact. We add new Registered Users through both organic and inorganic growth from existing customers and from the addition of End Users from new Installed Customers. Our Installed Customers had approximately 22.0 million, 21.1 million and 19.2 million Registered Users as of December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Registered Users as of September 30, 2024 were 24.4 million compared to 22.0 million as of September 30, 2023. 
 Net Revenue Retention Rate 
 We believe that our ability to retain our customers and expand their use of our products and services over time is an indicator of the stability of our revenue base and the long-term value of our customer relationships. One of the ways we assess our performance in this area is through our net revenue retention rate. We calculate our net revenue retention rate as the total revenues in a calendar year, excluding any revenues from acquired customers during such year, from customers who were implemented on any of our solutions as of December 31 of the prior year, expressed as a percentage of the total revenues during the prior year from the same group of customers. Our net revenue retention rate provides insight into the impact on current year revenues of: the number of new customers implemented on any of our solutions during the prior year; the timing of our implementation of those new customers in the prior year; growth in the number of End Users on such solutions and changes in their usage of such solutions; and sales of new products and services to our existing customers during the current year, excluding any products or services resulting from businesses acquired during such year and customer attrition. The most significant drivers of changes in our net revenue retention rate each year have historically been the number of new customers in the prior year and the timing of our implementation of those new customers. The timing of our implementation of new customers in the prior year is significant because we do not start recognizing revenues from new customers until they are implemented. If implementations are weighted more heavily in the first or second half of the prior year, our net revenue retention rate will be lower or higher, respectively. For example, in the first half of 2021, our implementations were weighted more heavily, and we experienced a lower net revenue retention rate in 2022 as a result. The continued strength observed in subscription revenue derived from our existing customers, offset by the expected decline in discretionary services revenue with some of our existing customers was reflected in the decline in net revenue retention rate in 2023. Our use of net revenue retention rate has limitations as an analytical tool, and investors should not consider it in isolation. Other companies in our industry may calculate net revenue retention rate differently, which reduces its usefulness as a comparative measure. Our net revenue retention rate was 108 , 110 and 119 for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

 Annualized Recurring Revenue 
 We believe Subscription Annual Recurring Revenue, or Subscription ARR, and Total Annual Recurring Revenue, or Total ARR, provide important information about our future revenue potential, our ability to acquire new clients, and our ability to maintain and expand our relationship with existing clients. We calculate Subscription ARR as the annualized value of all recurring subscription revenue recognized in the last month of the reporting period, with the exception of variable revenue in excess of contracted amounts for which we instead take the average monthly run rate of the trailing three months within that reporting period. Our Subscription ARR also includes the contracted minimum subscription amounts associated with all contracts in place at the end of the quarter for which revenue recognition has not yet commenced. Subscription revenues are defined within "Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgements and Estimates" in our Form 10-K. We calculate Total ARR as the annualized value of all recurring revenue recognized in the last month of the reporting period, with the exception of variable revenue in excess of contracted amounts for which we instead take the average monthly run rate of the trailing three months within that reporting period. Our Total ARR also includes the contracted minimums associated with all contracts in place at the end of the quarter for which revenue recognition has not yet commenced, and revenue generated from Integrated Services, which we previously referred to as Premier Services. Integrated Services revenue is generated from select established customer relationships where we have engaged with the customer for more tailored, premium professional services resulting in a deeper and ongoing level of engagement with them, which we deem to be recurring in nature. Total ARR does not include revenue from professional services or other sources of revenue that are not deemed to be recurring in nature. Subscription and Total ARR are not a forecast of future revenue, which can be impacted by contract start and end dates and renewal rates. Subscription and Total ARR should be viewed independently of revenue and deferred revenue as Subscription and Total ARR are operating metrics and are not intended to be combined with or replace these items. Our use of Subscription and Total ARR has limitations as an analytical tool, and investors should not consider it in isolation. Other companies in our industry may calculate Subscription ARR and Total ARR differently, which reduces their usefulness as comparative measures. 
 Our Subscription ARR was 593.9 million, 500.9 million and 426.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Subscription ARR as of September 30, 2024 was 654.6 million compared to 547.0 million as of September 30, 2023. Our Total ARR was 734.8 million, 655.2 million and 574.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Total ARR as of September 30, 2024 was 796.4 million compared to 693.6 million as of September 30, 2023. 
 Revenue Churn 
 We utilize revenue churn to monitor the satisfaction of our customers and evaluate the effectiveness of our business solutions and strategies. We define revenue churn as the amount of any monthly recurring revenue losses due to customer cancellations and downgrades, net of upgrades and replacements of existing solutions, during a year, divided by our monthly recurring revenue at the end of the prior year. Cancellations refer to customers that have either stopped using our services completely or remained a customer but terminated a particular service. Downgrades are a result of customers taking less of a particular service or renewing their contract for identical services at a lower price. We had annual revenue churn of 6.1 , 6.3 and 5.4 for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Our use of revenue churn has limitations as an analytical tool, and investors should not consider it in isolation. Other companies in our industry may calculate revenue churn differently, which reduces its usefulness as a comparative measure. 
 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 In addition to financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP, we use certain non-GAAP financial measures to clarify and enhance our understanding, and aid in the period-to-period comparison, of our performance. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide supplemental information that is meaningful when assessing our operating performance because they exclude the impact of certain categories that our management and board of directors do not consider part of core operating results when assessing our operational performance, allocating resources, preparing annual budgets and determining compensation. Accordingly, these non-GAAP financial measures may provide insight to investors into the motivation and decision-making of management in operating the business. Set forth in the tables below are the corresponding GAAP financial measures for each non-GAAP financial measure. Investors are encouraged to review the reconciliation of each of these non-GAAP financial measures to its most comparable GAAP financial measure included below. While we believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful supplemental information, non-GAAP financial measures have limitations and should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, their most comparable GAAP measures. These non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, do not reflect a comprehensive system of accounting and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies due to potential differences in their financing and accounting methods, the book value of their assets, their capital structures, the method by which their assets were acquired and the manner in which they define non-GAAP measures. Items such as the deferred revenue reduction from purchase accounting, stock-based compensation, transaction-related costs, amortization of acquired technology, amortization of acquired intangible assets and lease and other restructuring charges can have a material impact on our GAAP financial results.

 Non-GAAP Revenue 
 We define non-GAAP revenue as total revenue excluding the impact of purchase accounting. We monitor these measures to assess our performance because we believe our revenue growth rates would be understated without these adjustments. We believe presenting non-GAAP revenue aids in the comparability between periods and in assessing our overall operating performance. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, there was no impact of purchase accounting on revenue, and our non-GAAP total revenue is now equivalent to our GAAP total revenue. 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Revenue: GAAP revenue 175,021 154,967 513,419 462,506 Deferred revenue reduction from purchase accounting 76 275 Total Non-GAAP revenue 175,021 155,043 513,419 462,781 
 Non-GAAP Operating Income 
 We provide non-GAAP operating income that excludes such items as deferred revenue reduction from purchase accounting, stock-based compensation, transaction-related costs, amortization of acquired technology, amortization of acquired intangible assets and lease and other restructuring charges. We believe excluding these items is useful for the following reasons: 
 Deferred revenue reduction from purchase accounting. We provide non-GAAP information that excludes the deferred revenue reduction from purchase accounting. We believe that the exclusion of deferred revenue reduction from purchase accounting allows users of our financial statements to better review and understand the historical and current results of our continuing operations. 
 Amortization of acquired technology and intangible assets . We provide non-GAAP information that excludes expenses related to purchased technology and intangible assets associated with our acquisitions. We believe that eliminating these expenses from our non-GAAP measures is useful to investors, because the amortization of acquired technology and intangible assets can be inconsistent in amount and frequency and significantly impacted by the timing and magnitude of our acquisition transactions, which also vary in frequency from period to period. Accordingly, we analyze the performance of our operations in each period, both with and without such expenses. 
 Stock-based compensation . We provide non-GAAP information that excludes expenses related to stock-based compensation. We believe that the exclusion of stock-based compensation expense provides for a better comparison of our operating results to prior periods and to our peer companies as the calculations of stock-based compensation vary from period to period and company to company due to different valuation methodologies, subjective assumptions and the variety of award types. Because of these unique characteristics of stock-based compensation, we exclude these expenses when analyzing the organization's business performance. 
 Transaction-related costs . We exclude certain expense items resulting from our evaluation and completion of merger and acquisition and divestiture opportunities, such as related legal, accounting and consulting fees and retention expense. We consider these adjustments, to some extent, to be unpredictable and dependent on a significant number of factors that are outside of our control. Furthermore, transaction-related activities result in operating expenses that would not otherwise have been incurred by us in the normal course of our organic business operations. We believe that providing these non-GAAP measures that exclude transaction-related costs allows users of our financial statements to better review and understand the historical and current results of our continuing operations, and also facilitates comparisons to our historical results and results of less acquisitive peer companies, both with and without such adjustments. 
 Lease and other restructuring charges . We provide non-GAAP information that excludes restructuring charges related to the estimated costs of exiting and terminating facility lease commitments, partially offset by anticipated sublease income, and any related impairments of the right of use assets as they relate to corporate restructuring and exit activities. It also excludes severance cash payouts and other related compensation associated with restructuring, departure of executive officers or eliminating certain positions in connection with initiatives intended to align our resources to the portions of our business that we believe will drive the most long-term value. These charges are inconsistent in amount and are significantly impacted by the timing and nature of these events. Therefore, although we may incur these types of expenses in the future, we believe that eliminating these charges for purposes of calculating the non-GAAP financial measures facilitates a more meaningful evaluation of our operating performance and comparisons to our past operating performance.

 Adjusted EBITDA 
 We define adjusted EBITDA as net loss before deferred revenue reduction from purchase accounting, stock-based compensation, transaction-related costs, depreciation, amortization, lease and other restructuring charges, provision for income taxes, gain on extinguishment of debt and interest and other (income) expense, net. We believe that adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results for the following reasons: 
 adjusted EBITDA is widely used by investors and securities analysts to measure a company's operating performance with and without regard to items that can vary substantially from company to company depending upon their financing, capital structures and the method by which assets were acquired; 
 our management uses adjusted EBITDA in conjunction with GAAP financial measures for planning purposes, in the preparation of our annual operating budget, as a measure of our operating performance, to assess the effectiveness of our business strategies and to communicate with our board of directors concerning our financial performance; 
 adjusted EBITDA provides more consistency and comparability with our past financial performance, facilitates period-to-period comparisons of our operations and also facilitates comparisons with other companies, many of which use similar non-GAAP financial measures to supplement their GAAP results; and 
 our investor and analyst presentations include adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental measure of our overall operating performance. 
 Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to net loss or any other measure of financial performance calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. The use of adjusted EBITDA as an analytical tool has limitations such as: 
 depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, and the assets being depreciated or amortized will often have to be replaced in the future and adjusted EBITDA does not reflect cash requirements for such replacements; 
 adjusted EBITDA may not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs or contractual commitments; 
 adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the potentially dilutive impact of stock-based compensation; 
 adjusted EBITDA does not reflect interest or tax payments that could reduce cash available for use; and 
 other companies, including companies in our industry, might calculate adjusted EBITDA or similarly titled measures differently, which reduces their usefulness as comparative measures. 
 Because of these and other limitations, you should consider adjusted EBITDA together with our GAAP financial measures including cash flow from operations and net loss. The following table presents a reconciliation of net loss to adjusted EBITDA for each of the periods indicated (in thousands):

 Components of Operating Results 
 Revenues 
 Revenue-generating activities directly relate to the sale, implementation and support of our solutions within a single operating segment. We derive the majority of our revenues from subscription fees for the use of our solutions hosted in either our data centers or with cloud-based service providers, transactional revenue from bill-pay solutions and remote deposit products, revenues for professional services and implementation services related to our solutions and certain third-party related pass-through fees. We recognize the corresponding revenues over time on a ratable basis over the customer agreement term or as incurred based on the nature of the revenue. A small portion of our revenues are derived from customers which host and manage our solutions on-premises or in third-party data centers under term license and maintenance agreements. For these customers, we recognize software license revenue once the customer obtains control of the license, which generally occurs at the start of each license term. For these customers, we recognize the remaining arrangement consideration for maintenance revenue over time on a ratable basis over the term of the software license. 
 Subscription fees are based on the number of solutions purchased by our customers, the number of End Users using the solutions and other usage fees those users generate by using our solutions in excess of the levels included in our standard subscription fee. Subscription fees are billed monthly, quarterly or annually and are recognized monthly over the term of our customer agreements. The initial term of our digital banking platform agreements averages over five years, although it varies by customer. The structure and terms of our digital lending and relationship pricing arrangements vary, but generally are also sold on a subscription basis through our direct sales organization, and the related revenues are recognized over the terms of the customer agreements. The structure and terms of our Helix arrangements with FinTechs vary, but typically involve relatively lower contracted minimum revenues and instead emphasize usage-based revenue, with such revenue recognized as it is incurred. We begin recognizing subscription fees when the control of the service transfers to the customer, generally when the solution is implemented and made available to the customer. We recognize revenue for debit card and bill-pay related transaction services when End Users utilize debit card services integrated within our Helix and other payment-service solutions in the month incurred based on actual or estimated transactions. The timing of our implementations varies period-to-period based on our implementation capacity, the number of solutions purchased by our customers, the size and unique needs of our customers and the readiness of our customers to implement our solutions. We typically recognize any related implementation services revenues ratably over the initial customer agreement term beginning on the date we commence recognizing subscription fees. Contract asset balances arise primarily when we provide services in advance of billing for those services. Amounts that have been invoiced are recorded in accounts receivable, and in revenues or deferred revenues, depending on when control of the service transfers to the customer. 
 In recent periods we have observed improved subscription bookings and associated revenue primarily from our digital banking solutions as a result of banking conditions placing an importance on attracting and retaining deposits. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, our subscription revenue growth was 18 and 16 , respectively, as compared to the prior year period, and we expect subscription revenue will continue to increase as a percentage of total revenue. We have observed a general decline in transactional and other revenue from our Helix and payment solutions, resulting from decreased usage. In recent periods, we have also observed a general decline in customer demand for certain discretionary aspects of our solutions, namely professional serv ices, which we believe may be related to challenging economic conditions and the associated pressure on costs until the economic climate stabilizes and their respective financial outlooks improve.

 Cost of Revenues 
 Cost of revenues is comprised primarily of salaries and other personnel-related costs, including employee benefits, bonuses and stock-based compensation, for employees providing services to our customers. This includes the costs of our personnel performing implementation, customer support, data center and customer training activities. Cost of revenues also includes the direct costs of bill-pay and other third-party intellectual property included in our solutions, the amortization of deferred solution and services costs, amortization of certain software development costs, co-location facility costs and depreciation of our data center assets, debit card related pass-through fees, cloud-based hosting services, an allocation of general overhead costs, the amortization of acquired technology intangibles and referral fees. We allocate general overhead expenses to all departments based on the number of employees in each department, which we consider to be a fair and representative means of allocation. 
 We capitalize certain personnel costs directly related to the implementation of our solutions to the extent those costs are recoverable from future revenues. We amortize the costs for an implementation once revenue recognition commences, and we amortize those implementation costs to cost of revenues over the expected period of customer benefit, which has been determined to be the estimated life of the technology. Other costs not directly recoverable from future revenues are expensed in the period incurred. 
 We capitalize certain software development costs for those employees who are directly associated with and who devote time to developing our software solutions on an individual product basis, including those related to programmers, software engineers and quality control teams, as well as third-party development costs. Software development costs are amortized to cost of revenues when products and enhancements are released or made available over the products' estimated economic lives. 
 We intend to continue to increase our investments in our implementation and customer support teams and technology infrastructure to serve our customers and support our growth. Over the long term, we expect cost of revenues to continue to grow in absolute dollars as we grow our business but to fluctuate as a percentage of revenues based principally on cost efficiencies realized in the business, the level and timing of implementation support activities, timing of capitalized software development costs, debit card related pass-through fees, and other related costs. 
 Operating Expenses 
 Operating expenses primarily consist of sales and marketing, research and development and general and administrative expenses. They also include costs related to our acquisitions and the resulting amortization of acquired intangible assets from those acquisitions. We have from time-to-time experienced difficulty in hiring and retaining highly skilled employees with appropriate qualifications, resulting in increased personnel costs due to competition for talent and the related pressure to improve employee benefits and compensation to remain competitive. In an effort to reduce certain of our personnel related expenditures and improve the scaling of expenses relative to revenue growth, we have increased the efficiency of our global workforce structure. Over the long term, we intend to continue to hire new employees and make other investments to support our anticipated growth. As a result, we expect our operating expenses to increase in absolute dollars but to decrease as a percentage of revenues over the long term as we grow our business. 
 Sales and Marketing 
 Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries and other personnel-related costs, including commissions, employee benefits, bonuses and stock-based compensation. Sales and marketing expenses also include expenses related to advertising, lead generation, promotional events, corporate communications, travel and allocated overhead. 
 Sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of total revenues will change in any given period based on several factors including the addition of newly hired sales professionals, the number and timing of newly installed customers and the amount of sales commissions expense amortized related to those customers. Commissions are generally capitalized and then amortized over the expected period of customer benefit. Sales and marketing expenses are impacted by the timing of significant marketing events such as our annual in-person client conference, which we typically hold during the second quarter of each year. 
 Research and Development 
 We believe that continuing to improve and enhance our solutions is essential to maintaining our reputation for innovation and growing our customer base and revenues. Research and development expenses include salaries and personnel-related costs, including employee benefits, bonuses and stock-based compensation, third-party contractor expenses, software development costs, allocated overhead and other related expenses incurred in developing new solutions and enhancing existing solutions.

Table of Contents 

 Certain research and development costs that are related to our software development, which include salaries and other personnel-related costs, comprised of employee benefits, stock-based compensation and bonuses attributed to programmers, software engineers and quality control teams working on our software solutions, are capitalized and included in intangible assets, net on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. We intend to continue our investments in our software development teams and the associated technology in order to serve our customers and support our growth. 
 General and Administrative 
 General and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other personnel-related costs, including employee benefits, bonuses and stock-based compensation, of our administrative, finance and accounting, information systems, compliance and security, legal, human resources employees and certain members of our executive team. General and administrative expenses also include consulting and professional fees, insurance, travel and other corporate expenses. We expect to continue to incur incremental expenses associated with the growth of our business and to meet increased compliance requirements associated with operating as a regulated, public company. These expenses include costs to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and other regulations governing public companies, increased costs of directors' and officers' liability insurance and investor relations activities. 
 Transaction-Related Costs 
 Transaction-related costs include compensation expenses related to milestone provisions and retention agreements with certain former shareholders and employees of acquired businesses, which are recognized as earned, and various legal and professional service expenses incurred in connection with merger and acquisition and divestiture related matters, which are recognized when incurred. 
 Amortization of Acquired Intangibles 
 Amortization of acquired intangibles represents the amortization of intangibles recorded in connection with our business acquisitions which are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the related assets. 
 Lease and Other Restructuring Charges 
 Lease and other restructuring charges include costs related to the early vacating of certain facilities, any related impairment of the right of use assets and ongoing expenses of other vacated facilities, partially offset by anticipated sublease income from the associated facilities. It also includes severance cash payouts and other related compensation associated with restructuring, departure of executive officers or eliminating certain positions in connection with initiatives intended to align our resources to the portions of our business that we believe will drive the most long-term value. 
 Total Other Income, Net 
 Total other income, net, consists primarily of interest income and expense, other non-operating income and expense, loss on disposal of long-lived assets, foreign currency translation adjustment and gain on extinguishment of debt. We earn interest income on our cash, cash equivalents and investments. Interest expense consists primarily of the interest from the amortization of debt issuance costs, coupon interest attributable to our convertible notes, commitment fees associated with our Revolving Credit Agreement, as well as fees and interest associated with the letter of credit issued to our landlord for the security deposit for our corporate headquarters. 
 Provision for Income Taxes 
 As a result of our current net operating loss position, our income tax expenses and benefits consist primarily of state current income tax expense, deferred income tax expense relating to the tax amortization of recently acquired goodwill and current income tax expense from foreign operations.

 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023. Cost of revenues increased by 14.0 million, or 5.8 , from 241.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 255.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. This increase was primarily attributable to a 6.9 million net increase in co-location facility, hardware and software costs, cloud-based hosting costs and depreciation of our data center assets resulting from the increased infrastructure necessary to support our growing customer activity, a 5.9 million increase in personnel costs, including an increase in the number of personnel who provide implementation and customer support services and maintain our data centers and other technical infrastructure, a 4.5 million increase from the amortization of capitalized software development and capitalized implementation services, a 2.1 million increase in third-party costs related to intellectual property included in our solutions and transaction processing costs and a 1.5 million increase in overhead costs and other discretionary expenses, partially offset by a 3.0 million decrease in services, primarily in pass-through fees, a 2.8 million decrease as a result of higher capitalized implementation costs and a 1.1 million decrease in amortization of acquired customer technology resulting from assets that became fully amortized. 
 We continue to invest in personnel, business process improvement, third-party partners for intellectual property and transactional processing in our solutions and systems infrastructure to standardize our business processes and drive future efficiency in our implementations, cloud-based hosting services, customer support and data center operations. As we continue to make these investments, we expect they will increase cost of revenues in absolute dollars, and we expect such expenses to decline as a percentage of revenue as our operations continue to scale and revenues grow. 
 Operating Expenses 
 The following tables present our operating expenses for each of the periods indicated (dollars in thousands): 
 Sales and Marketing 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Change Nine Months Ended September 30, Change 2024 2023 ) 2024 2023 ) Sales and marketing 25,558 26,123 (565) (2.2) 78,736 82,968 (4,232) (5.1) Percentage of revenues 14.6 16.9 15.3 17.9 
 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Three Months Ended September 30, 2023. Sales and marketing expenses decreased by 0.6 million, or 2.2 , from 26.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 25.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024. This decrease was primarily attributable to a 0.3 million decrease in travel-related and other discretionary expenses and a 0.3 million decrease in marketing activities. 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023. Sales and marketing expenses decreased by 4.2 million, or 5.1 , from 83.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 78.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease was primarily attributable to a 4.2 million reduction in personnel costs due to measures taken to drive operational effectiveness in our go-to-market strategy. 
 We anticipate that sales and marketing expenses will increase in absolute dollars in the long-term as we continue to support our revenue growth and increase marketing spend to attract new customers, retain and grow existing customers, build brand awareness, and as we continue to hold various experiences for our current and prospective customers, including our annual client conference typically held during the second quarter. While we anticipate sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue may fluctuate on a near-term basis, we expect such expenses to decline as a percentage of our revenues over the long-term as our revenues grow and we realize cost efficiencies in the business.

This increase was primarily attributable to a 1.7 million increase in personnel costs as a result of the growth in our research and development organization to support continued enhancements to our solutions and a 0.4 million increase from lower capitalization of software development costs. 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023. Research and development expenses increased by 4.5 million, or 4.3 , from 103.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 107.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. This increase was primarily attributable to a 2.2 million increase in personnel costs as a result of the growth in our research and development organization to support continued enhancements to our solutions, a 1.3 million increase from lower capitalization of software development costs and a 0.6 million increase in travel-related and other discretionary expenses. 
 We anticipate that research and development expenses will increase in absolute dollars in the future as we continue to support and expand our platform and enhance our existing solutions, as we believe existing customers will have an increased focus on maintaining and improving their digital offerings. While we anticipate research and development expenses as a percentage of revenue may fluctuate on a near-term basis, we expect such expenses to decline as a percentage of our revenues over the long-term as our revenues grow and we realize cost efficiencies in the business.

The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to a 3.8 million increase in personnel costs, including stock-based compensation, to support the growth of our business and a 0.6 million increase in other discretionary expenses, partially offset by a 1.2 million decrease in charitable contributions from the prior year. 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023.

Table of Contents 

 General and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries, stock-based compensation and other personnel-related costs of our administrative, finance and accounting, information systems, compliance and security, legal, human resources employees and certain members of our executive team. General and administrative expenses also include costs to comply with regulations governing public companies and financial institutions, costs of directors' and officers' liability insurance, third-party legal fees, investor relations activities and costs to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, or SOX. Over the long term, we anticipate that general and administrative expenses will continue to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to incur both increased external audit fees as well as additional spending to ensure continued regulatory and SOX compliance. We expect such expenses to decline as a percentage of our revenues over the longer term as our revenues grow and we realize cost efficiencies in the business.

 Seasonality and Quarterly Results 
 Our overall operating results fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of a variety of factors, including the timing of investments to grow our business. The timing of our implementation activities and corresponding revenues from new customers are subject to fluctuations based on the timing of our sales, which has historically tended to be lower in the first half of the year. The timing of our implementations also varies period-to-period based on our implementation capacity, the number of solutions purchased by our customers, the size and unique needs of our customers and the readiness of our customers to implement our solutions. 
 Our quarterly results of operations may vary significantly in the future and period-to-period comparisons of our operating results may not be meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future results. We continue to monitor the impacts the current interest rate and inflationary environment, challenges in the financial services industry, and global economic uncertainty may have on our business. The recent challenging economic conditions and uncertainties in the financial services industry continue to be highly unpredictable and may continue to disrupt any seasonality trends that may otherwise typically be inherent in our historical operating results. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Sources of Liquidity 
 We have financed our operations primarily through the proceeds from the issuance of common stock from our initial public offering in March 2014, additional registered common stock offerings, convertible note offerings, and cash flows from operations. As of September 30, 2024, our principal sources of liquidity were cash, cash equivalents and investments of 407.9 million. Based upon our current levels of operations, we believe that our cash flow from operations along with our other sources of liquidity, including our ability to access capital markets and available borrowings under our 125.0 million Revolving Credit Agreement, are adequate to meet our cash requirements for the next twelve months. However, if we determine there is a need for additional short-term liquidity, there is no assurance that such financing, if pursued, would be adequate or available on terms acceptable to us.

 Cash Flows 
 The following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods indicated (in thousands): 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities 92,716 33,715 Investing activities (14,634) 78,669 Financing activities 10,506 (156,087) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash (72) (137) Net increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash 88,516 (43,840) 
 Cash Flows from Operating Activities 
 Our cash flows from operating activities are primarily influenced by net loss less non-cash items, the amount and timing of customer receipts and vendor payments and by the amount of cash we invest in personnel and infrastructure to support the anticipated growth of our business and increase in the number of installed customers. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our net cash and cash equivalents provided by operating activities was 92.7 million, which consisted of a net loss of 38.7 million and non-cash adjustments of 146.1 million, partially offset by cash outflows from changes in operating assets and liabilities of 14.7 million. The primary drivers of cash outflows in operating assets and liabilities were a 21.9 million increase in deferred solution costs primarily from annual commission payments and deferred implementation costs from both new customers and existing customer expansions, a 14.8 million increase in accounts receivable primarily due to the timing of annual billings and a 6.6 million decrease in other long-term liabilities. Cash outflows were partially offset by cash inflows resulting from a 30.5 million increase in deferred revenue due to the timing of annual billings and deposits received from customers prior to the recognition of revenue from those related payments. Non-cash adjustments primarily consisted of stock-based compensation, depreciation and amortization, amortization of deferred implementation and deferred solution and other costs, amortization of debt issuance costs, deferred income taxes and lease impairments, partially offset by amortization of premiums and discounts on investments. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, our net cash and cash equivalents provided by operating activities was 33.7 million, which consisted of a net loss of 47.3 million and non-cash adjustments of 116.3 million, partially offset by cash outflows from changes in operating assets and liabilities of 35.3 million. The primary drivers of cash outflows in operating assets and liabilities were a 24.5 million increase in deferred solution costs primarily from annual commission payments, and deferred implementation costs from both new customers and existing customer expansions, a 7.1 million decrease in other long-term liabilities and a 5.5 million decrease in deferred revenue due to the recognition of revenue from payments in prior periods exceeding receipts from customers during the period. Non-cash adjustments primarily consisted of stock-based compensation, depreciation and amortization, amortization of deferred implementation and deferred solution and other costs, amortization of debt issuance costs and lease impairments, partially offset by a gain on extinguishment of debt and amortization of premiums and discounts on investments. 
 Cash Flows from Investing Activities 
 Our investing activities have consisted primarily of purchases and maturities of investments, acquisitions of businesses, costs incurred for the development of capitalized software and purchases of property and equipment to support our growth. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our net cash used in investing activities was 14.6 million, consisting of 67.3 million for purchases of investments, 17.6 million for capitalized software development costs and 5.3 million for the purchase of property and equipment, partially offset by 75.6 million received from the maturities of investments. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, our net cash provided by investing activities was 78.7 million, consisting of 179.4 million from maturities of investments, partially offset by 76.8 million from purchases of investments, 19.3 million from capitalized software development costs and 4.6 million for the purchase of property and equipment.

 Cash Flows from Financing Activities 
 Our recent financing activities have consisted primarily of activity related to our convertible notes as well as net proceeds from exercises of options, contributions to our Employee Stock Purchase Plan, or ESPP, to purchase our common stock and payments for debt issuance costs related to the Revolving Credit Agreement. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our net cash provided by financing activities was 10.5 million, primarily consisting of 11.4 million due to cash received from exercises of stock options and contributions to our ESPP to purchase our common stock, partially offset by 0.9 million for payment of debt issuance costs related to the Revolving Credit Agreement. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, our net cash used in financing activities was 156.1 million, primarily consisting of 149.6 million from payments for the partial repurchases of the 2026 Notes and 2025 Notes and 10.9 million from payment of the 2023 Notes which matured in February 2023, partially offset by 4.3 million in cash received from exercises of stock options and contributions to our ESPP to purchase our common stock. 
 
 Contractual Obligations and Commitments 
 Our principal commitments consist of the 2026 Notes, 2025 Notes, non-cancelable operating leases related to our facilities, minimum purchase commitments for sponsorship obligations, third-party products, co-location fees and other product costs. Our obligations under our convertible senior notes and Revolving Credit Agreement are described in Note 9 to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Information regarding our non-cancellable leases and other purchase commitments as of the nine months ended September 30, 2024 can be found in Note 7 and Note 8 to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
 See Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies contained in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report, regarding the impact of certain recent accounting pronouncements. 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgements and Estimates 
 The preparation of our interim unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses and the related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in our interim unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. In accordance with GAAP, we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. We evaluate our estimates, judgments and assumptions on an ongoing basis, and while we believe that our estimates, judgments and assumptions are reasonable, they are based upon information available at the time. Actual results might differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 
 Our significant accounting policies are discussed in Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" under the heading "Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates" in our Form 10-K. There were no material changes to our significant accounting policies. 
 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 Market risk is the risk of loss to future earnings, values or future cash flows that may result from changes in the price of a financial instrument. The value of a financial instrument might change as a result of changes in interest rates, exchange rates, commodity prices, equity prices and other market changes. We do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative, hedging or trading purposes, although in the future we might enter into exchange rate hedging arrangements to manage the risks described below. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 We have cash and cash equivalents held primarily in cash and money market funds. In addition, we have marketable securities which typically include U.S. government securities, corporate bonds and commercial paper and certificates of deposit. Cash and cash equivalents are held for working capital purposes. Marketable securities are held and invested with capital preservation as the primary objective. Due to the short-term nature of these investments, we believe that we do not have any material exposure to changes in the fair value of our investment portfolio as a result of changes in interest rates. Any declines in interest rates will reduce future interest income. If overall interest rates fell by 10 in 2024 or 2023, our interest income would not have been materially affected. As of September 30, 2024, we had an outstanding principal amount of 304.0 million of 2026 Notes with a fixed annual interest rate of 0.75 and an outstanding principal amount of 191.0 million of 2025 Notes with a fixed annual interest rate of 0.125 .

Table of Contents 

 Borrowings under our Revolving Credit Agreement bear interest at rates that are variable. To the extent that we draw amounts under the Revolving Credit Agreement, we are exposed to increased market risk from changes in the underlying index rates, which would affect our interest expense. As of September 30, 2024, there were no amounts drawn on the Revolving Credit Agreement. 
 Foreign Currency Risk 
 As of September 30, 2024, our most significant currency exposures were the Indian rupee, Mexican peso, Canadian dollar, Australian dollar and British pound. As of September 30, 2024, we had operating subsidiaries in India, Mexico, Canada, Australia and the United Kingdom. Due to the relatively low volume of payments made by us through these foreign subsidiaries, we do not believe we have significant exposure to foreign currency exchange risks. However, fluctuations in currency exchange rates could harm our results of operations in the future. 
 We currently do not use derivative financial instruments to mitigate foreign currency exchange risks. We will continue to review this matter and may consider hedging certain foreign exchange risks in future years. 
 Inflation Risk 
 We do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. As inflation has accelerated in the U.S. and globally, we continue to monitor all inflation-driven costs, regardless of where they are incurred. I f our costs were to become subject to significant inflationary pressures, we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs through price increases. Our inability or failure to do so could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 The term "disclosure controls and procedures," as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act refers to controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that such information is accumulated and communicated to a company's management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024, the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based upon such evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of such date. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There were no material changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the three-month period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, which were identified in connection with management's evaluation required by Rules 13a-15(d) and 15d-15(d) under the Exchange Act, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 PART II - OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings. 
 From time to time, we may become involved in legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of our business. Management believes that there are no claims or actions pending against us, the ultimate disposition of which would have a material impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 
 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors. 
 Reference is made to the factors set forth under the caption "Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements" in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and other risk factors described in Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. Other than as set forth below, there have been no material changes from the risk factors disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. 
 We incurred indebtedness by issuing our 2026 Notes in 2019, and our 2025 Notes in 2020, we may borrow under our Revolving Credit Agreement, and our debt repayment obligations may adversely affect our financial condition and cash flows from operations in the future. 
 Our indebtedness under our convertible notes may impair our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for general corporate purposes, including working capital, capital expenditures, potential acquisitions and strategic transactions, and a portion of our cash flows from operations may have to be dedicated to repaying the principal of the 2026 Notes in 2026 and the principal of the 2025 Notes in 2025, or earlier if necessary. Additionally, if our stock trades at a level where the conversion of any series of our convertible notes is not economical for note holders, the conversion of the applicable series of convertible notes is unlikely. This would require us to repay the full aggregate principal amount outstanding of the applicable series of our convertible notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts (if any) at maturity, in lieu of settling conversions of the convertible notes, and thus extinguishing our indebtedness under such convertible notes with shares of our common stock. 
 In addition, holders of each series of our convertible notes will have the right to require us to repurchase all or a portion of their notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change, as defined in the respective indentures, at a repurchase price equal to 100 of the principal amount of the notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest. Upon conversion of each series of convertible notes, unless we elect to settle such conversion solely through delivery of shares of our common stock to (other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share), we will be required to make cash payments in respect of the series of notes being converted. We may not have enough available cash on hand or be able to obtain financing at the time we are required to make the repurchases of the series of convertible notes surrendered therefor, or at the time such series of convertible notes is being converted, to settle such repurchase or conversion. In addition, our ability to repurchase each series of convertible notes or to pay cash upon the conversions of each series of convertible notes may be limited by law, by regulatory authority or by agreements governing our current and future indebtedness. Our failure to repurchase a series of convertible notes at a time when the repurchase is required by the applicable indenture, or to pay any cash payable on future conversions of such series of convertible notes as required by the applicable indenture, would constitute a default under such indenture. A default under one of the indentures governing our convertible notes or a fundamental change itself could also lead to a default under our Revolving Credit Agreement and agreements governing our future indebtedness. If the repayment of the related indebtedness were to be accelerated after any applicable notice or grace periods, we may not have sufficient funds to repay the indebtedness and repurchase the notes or make cash payments upon conversions thereof. An event of default under an indenture governing any of our convertible notes may lead to an acceleration of the applicable series of notes. Any such acceleration could result in our bankruptcy, in which the holders of our convertible notes would have a claim to our assets that is senior to the claims of our equity holders.

 Our Revolving Credit Agreement provides for a 125.0 million revolving line of credit, none of which was drawn as of September 30, 2024. The Revolving Credit Agreement contains customary representations, warranties, affirmative and negative covenants, including covenants which restrict our ability, or any of our subsidiaries to, among other things, create liens, incur additional indebtedness and engage in certain other transactions, in each case subject to certain exclusions. In addition, the Revolving Credit Agreement contains certain financial covenants which become effective in the event our liquidity (as defined in the Revolving Credit Agreement) falls below specified levels. The Revolving Credit Agreement contains customary events of default relating to, among other things, payment defaults, breach of covenants, cross-default acceleration to material indebtedness, bankruptcy-related defaults, judgment defaults, and the occurrence of certain change of control events. Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Agreement are secured by our assets and those of Q2 Software, Inc., our wholly owned subsidiary, which has guaranteed all obligations under the Revolving Credit Agreement. The occurrence of an event of default may result in the termination of the Revolving Credit Agreement, an acceleration of repayment obligations with respect to any outstanding principal amounts, an acceleration of repayment obligations with respect to the 2025 Notes and 2026 Notes, or the lenders foreclosing on their security interest, the occurrence of any of which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Our indebtedness could have important consequences because it may impair our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes, or otherwise constrain the operation of our business. Our ability to meet our debt obligations will depend on our future performance, which will be affected by financial, business, economic, regulatory and other factors, many of which are not under our control. Our future operations may not generate sufficient cash to enable us to repay our debt. If we fail to comply with any covenants contained in the agreements governing any of the debt or fail to make a payment on our debt when due, we could be in default on such debt. If we are at any time unable to pay our indebtedness when due, we may be required to renegotiate the terms of the indebtedness, seek to refinance all or a portion of the indebtedness or obtain additional financing. There can be no assurance that, in the future, we will be able to successfully renegotiate such terms, that any such refinancing would be possible or that any additional financing could be obtained on terms that are favorable or acceptable to us.

 a policy pursuant to which any participant in the Company s equity incentive plans whose transactions are subject to Section 16 of the Security Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is required to sell, upon the vesting or settlement of any such award, a portion of the shares subject to the award determined by the Company in its discretion to be sufficient to cover tax withholding obligations and to remit an amount equal to such tax withholding obligations to the Company. This mandatory sell-to-cover policy was adopted by the Company as a result of the inability of the Company's captive broker to effect the sell-to-cover transactions pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plans.
