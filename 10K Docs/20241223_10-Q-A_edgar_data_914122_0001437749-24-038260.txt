EXPLANATORY NOTE 
 
 Perma-Pipe International Holdings, Inc. (the "Company") is filing this (the "Form 10-Q/A") to its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended July 31, 2024, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") on September 11, 2024 (the "Original Form 10-Q"). 
 
 On December 19, 2024, the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company, in consultation with members of the Company's management and the Company's independent registered public accounting firm, concluded that the Company's unaudited consolidated financial statements in its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the six months ended July 31, 2024, should no longer be relied upon because of certain errors as further described below: 
 
 The errors resulted from a subsidiary in the Middle East incorrectly recording a duplicate invoice during the three months ended April 30, 2024. This duplication related to the purchase of property, plant, and equipment ("PP E"), resulting in an overstatement of PP E and trade accounts payable on the consolidated balance sheet and a corresponding overstatement of net cash provided by operating activities and net cash used in investing activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows. The Company also identified certain intercompany transactions related to asset transfers in the Middle East that were not appropriately eliminated in the Company's unaudited consolidated financial statements. See Note 1 - Basis of presentation (As Restated) in the notes to the consolidated financial statements of this Form 10-Q/A for further details. 
 
 The following sections have been amended to reflect the effects of this restatement: 
 
 Part I - Item 1. Financial Statements 
 
 Part I - Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 
 Part I - Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 
 Part II - Item 6. Exhibits 
 
 The Company has amended Item 4 to modify and enhance the Company's disclosure of the material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting based on our evaluation of the impact of the errors described above. 
 
 This Form 10-Q/A sets forth the Original Form 10-Q in its entirety, as amended to reflect the restatement. Except as specifically noted above, this Form 10-Q/A does not modify, amend, or update disclosures in the Original Form 10-Q, and this Form 10-Q/A does not reflect events occurring after the filing of the Original Form 10-Q or modify or update any other disclosures. 
 
 This Form 10-Q/A should be read in conjunction with the Company's filings with the SEC subsequent to the date on which the Original Form 10-Q was filed.

million on the consolidated balance sheet and a corresponding overstatement of net cash provided by operating activities and net cash used in investing activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows during the three months ended April 30, 2024, and 2 certain intercompany transactions related to asset transfers in the Middle East that were not appropriately eliminated in the Company's unaudited consolidated financial statements during the six months ended July 31, 2024. The failure to appropriately eliminate these intercompany transactions resulted in the following errors in the Company's unaudited consolidated financial statements: 
 
 An overstatement of trade accounts receivable of million and a corresponding understatement of PP E on the consolidated balance sheet. 
 An understatement of net cash provided by operating activities of million and a corresponding overstatement in effect of exchange rate changes in the consolidated statement of cash flows. 
 An overstatement of net cash used in investing activities of million and corresponding overstatement in effect of exchange rate changes in the consolidated statement of cash flows.

Management evaluated the impact on the unaudited consolidated financial statements as of and for the three months ended April 30, 2024, and determined that the impact was not material. Accordingly, management will revise the unaudited consolidated financial statements as of and for the three months ended April 30, 2024, the next time such consolidated financial statements are filed which will be in connection with the issuance of the Quarterly Report on Form 10 -Q for the three months ended April 30, 2025. 

reportable segment: Piping Systems. The Company engineers, manufactures and sells pre-insulated specialty piping systems, and leak detection systems. Pre-insulated specialty piping systems include: (i) insulated and jacketed district heating and cooling piping systems for efficient energy distribution from central energy plants to multiple locations, (ii) primary and secondary containment piping systems for transporting chemicals, hazardous fluids and petroleum products, (iii) the coating and/or insulation of oil and gas gathering and transmission pipelines, and (iv) liquid and powder based anti-corrosion coatings applied both to the external and internal surfaces of steel pipe, including shapes like bends, reducers, tees, and other spools/fittings used in pipelines for the transportation of oil and gas products and potable water. The Company's leak detection systems are sold with its piping systems or on a stand-alone basis to monitor areas where fluid intrusion may contaminate the environment, endanger personal safety, cause a fire hazard, impair essential services or damage equipment or property. 

In 2015, the Company completed a project in the Middle East with billings in the aggregate amount of approximately million. The system has not yet been commissioned by the customer. Nevertheless, the Company has received approximately million as of July 31, 2024 , with a remaining balance due in the amount of million, all of which pertains to retention clauses within the agreements with the Company's customer, and which become payable by the customer when this project is fully tested and commissioned. Of this amount, million is classified in other long-term assets on the Company's consolidated balance sheets. 
 
 The Company has been actively involved in ongoing efforts to collect this outstanding balance. The Company continues to engage with the customer to ensure full payment of the open balances, and during the six months ended July 31, 2024 , and at various times throughout 2023, the Company received partial payments to settle million and million, respectively, of the customer's outstanding balances. Further, the Company has been engaged by the customer to perform additional work in 2024 under customary trade terms that supports the continued cooperation between the Company and the customer. As a result, the Company did not reserve any allowance against the remaining outstanding balances as of July 31, 2024 . However, if the Company's efforts to collect on this account are not successful, the Company may recognize an allowance for all, or substantially all, of any such then uncollected amounts. 
 
 For the three months ended July 31, 2024 , individual customer accounted for greater than 10 of the Company's consolidated net sales, and during the same period in 2023, one customer accounted for greater than 10 of the Company's consolidated net sales. For the six months ended July 31, 2024 and 2023 , individual customer accounted for greater than 10 of the Company's consolidated net sales. 
 
 As of July 31, 2024 and January 31, 2024 , individual customer accounted for more than 10 of the Company's accounts receivable, and one customer accounted for more than 10 of the Company's accounts receivable, respectively. 

Specialty Piping Systems and Coating 
 Revenue recognized under input method 
 Revenue recognized under output method 
 Total 

The input method as noted in ASC 606 - 10 - 55 - 20 is used by certain operating entities to measure revenue by the costs incurred to date relative to the estimated costs to satisfy the contract over time. Generally, these contracts are considered a single performance obligation satisfied over time and due to the custom nature of the goods and services, the "over time" method is the most faithful depiction of the Company s performance as it measures the value of the goods and services transferred to the customer. Costs include all material, labor, and direct costs incurred to satisfy the performance obligations of the contract. Revenue recognition begins when projects costs are incurred. 

The output method as noted in ASC 606 - 10 - 55 - 17 is used by all other operating entities to measure revenue by the direct measurement of the outputs produced relative to the remaining goods promised under the contract. Due to the types of end customers, generally these contracts require formal inspection protocols or specific export documentation for units produced, or produced and shipped, therefore, the output method is the most faithful depiction of the Company s performance. Depending on the conditions of the contract, revenue may be recognized based on units produced, inspected and held by the Company prior to shipment or on units produced, inspected and shipped. 
 
 Some of the Company s operating entities invoice and collect milestones or other contractual obligations prior to the transfer of goods and services, but do not recognize revenue until the performance obligations are satisfied under the methods discussed above. 
 
 Contract modifications that occur prior to the start of the manufacturing process will supersede the original contract and revenue is recognized using the modified contract value. Contract modifications that occur during the manufacturing process (changes in scope of work, job performance, material costs, and/or final contract settlements) are recognized in the period in which the revisions are known. Provisions are made for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts in the contract liabilities account in the period in which such losses are determined. 
 
 The transaction price associated with the Company's contracts with customers are generally determined based on the fixed amount of consideration as specified in a contract. This may also include variable consideration in certain instances where it is considered probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur. As a result, the amount of consideration ultimately received from the customer can fluctuate due to the variability of future events stated in a contract. Therefore, the aggregate amount of the transaction price includes the fixed consideration contained in a contract that is generally not subject to change and excludes sales and value added taxes, or amounts collected on behalf of third parties, along with any variable consideration. The total transaction price is then allocated to the performance obligations which is eventually recognized as revenue based on the project type and the method that is used to measure the transfer of promised goods and services to customers. Additionally, transaction prices relating to cost-plus contracts are determined by applying the applicable profit margin to costs incurred on contracts, whereas transaction prices relating to fixed price contracts are determined on a lump-sum basis. Further, standard payment terms are generally net 30 to 60 days, which is customer specific. 
 
 Contract assets and liabilities 
 
 Contract assets represent revenue recognized in excess of amounts billed for work in progress for which the Company has a valid contract and an enforceable right to payment for work completed. Contract liabilities represent billings in excess of costs for work in progress for which the Company has a valid contract and an enforceable right to payment for work completed. Both customer billings and the satisfaction (or partial satisfaction) of the performance obligation(s) occur throughout the manufacturing process and impact the period end balances in these accounts. In addition, contract assets include receivables or amounts that are billable beyond the passage of time. 
 
 The following table shows the reconciliation of costs in excess of billings and billings in excess of costs: 

Estimated earnings 
 Earned revenue 
 Less billings to date 
 Costs in excess of billings, net 
 Balance sheet classification 
 Contract assets: Costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts 
 Contract liabilities: Billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts 
 Costs in excess of billings, net 

The Company anticipates that substantially all costs incurred on uncompleted contracts as of July 31, 2024 will be billed and collected within one year . 
 
 Unbilled accounts receivable 
 
 The Company has recorded million and million of unbilled accounts receivable on the consolidated balance sheet s as of July 31, 2024 and January 31, 2024 , from revenues generated by certain of its subsidiaries. The Company has fulfilled all performance obligations and has recorded revenue under the respective contracts. The deliverables under these contracts have been accepted by the customer and billings will be made once the customer takes possession of or arranges shipping for the products. The Company anticipates that substantially all of the amounts included in unbilled accounts receivable as of July 31, 2024 will be billed within one year. 
 
 Practical expedients 
 
 Costs to obtain a contract are not considered to be incremental or material, and project duration generally does not span more than one year. Accordingly, the Company applies the practical expedient for these types of costs and as such, are expensed in the period incurred. 
 
 As a result of the Company's contracts having a duration of less than one year, a practical expedient was applied regarding disclosure of the aggregate amount and future timing of performance obligations that are unsatisfied or partially satisfied as of the end of the reporting period. 

Work in process 
 Finished goods 
 Subtotal 
 Less allowance 
 Inventories 

The Company conducts periodic reviews of its inventory and records allowances for slow moving and obsolete items to reflect their net realizable value, which is primarily attributable to finished goods. 

and , respectively. The Company's ETR was and for the six months ended July 31, 2024 and 2023 , respectively. The change in the ETR is due to the ability to recognize tax benefits on losses in the United States in the current year whereas the prior year had a full valuation allowance and changes in the mix of income and loss in various jurisdictions. 
 
 The Company expects that future distributions from foreign subsidiaries will not be subject to incremental U.S. federal tax as they will be excludible from U.S. taxable income either be remittances of previously taxed earnings and profits or eligible for a full dividends received deduction. Current and future earnings in the Company's subsidiaries in Canada and Egypt are not permanently reinvested. The earnings from these subsidiaries are subject to tax in their local jurisdiction, and withholding taxes in these jurisdictions are considered. As such, the Company has accrued a liability of million as of July 31, 2024 related to these taxes. 

interest in Perma-Pipe Canada, Ltd., which occurred in 2016. 
 
 The following table provides a reconciliation of changes in the carrying amount of goodwill: 

The Company performs an impairment assessment of goodwill annually as of January 31, or more frequently if triggering events occur, based on the estimated fair value of the related reporting unit or intangible asset. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. During the period ended July 31, 2024 , the Company performed a periodic assessment to determine whether there were any triggering events that may have occurred which could indicate that more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit did not exceed its carrying value, resulting in an impairment. Based on this assessment, the Company did not identify any triggering events that would indicate that the fair value is less than the carrying value of the reporting unit at July 31, 2024 . Accordingly, the Company did not proceed with performing an impairment test as a result of this periodic assessment. The Company will continue testing for impairment at least annually as of January 31, or as otherwise required by applicable accounting standards. 

shares for grants and issuances under these incentive plans, including issuances pursuant to unvested or unexercised prior awards. 
 
 The Company's prior incentive plans provided for the grant of deferred shares, non-qualified stock options, incentive stock options, restricted shares, restricted stock units, and performance-based restricted stock units intended to qualify under section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code. The prior incentive plans authorized awards to officers, employees, consultants, and independent directors. 
 
 The Company's 2024 Omnibus Stock Incentive Plan, dated May 28, 2024, was approved by the Company's stockholders in July 2024 "2024 Plan"). The 2024 Plan will expire in July 2027. The 2024 Plan authorizes awards to officers, employees, consultants, and independent directors. 
 
 Grants were made in connection with the 2024 Plan and the prior incentive plans to employees, officers, and independent directors, as further described below.

The Company's obligations under the Renewed Senior Credit Facility are currently guaranteed by Perma-Pipe Canada, Inc. Each of the North American Loan Parties other than Perma-Pipe Canada, Inc. (collectively, the "Borrowers") is a borrower under the Renewed Senior Credit Facility. 
 
 The Borrowers have used and will continue to use borrowings under the Renewed Senior Credit Facility (i) to fund future capital expenditures; (ii) to fund ongoing working capital needs; and (iii) for other corporate purposes, including potentially additional stock repurchases. Borrowings under the Renewed Senior Credit Facility bear interest at a rate equal to an alternate base rate, SOFR rate index, plus, in each case, an applicable margin. The applicable margin is based on a fixed charge coverage ratio ("FCCR") range. Interest on alternate base rate borrowings is the alternate base rate (as defined in the Renewed Senior Credit Facility) plus an applicable margin ranging from to , based on the FCCR in the most recently reported period. Interest on SOFR rate borrowings is the SOFR rate (as defined in the Renewed Senior Credit Facility) plus an applicable margin ranging from to , based on the FCCR in the most recently reported period, as well as an additional SOFR adjustment ranging from to , based on the term of the interest period. Additionally, the Borrowers pay a per annum facility fee on the unused portion of the Renewed Senior Credit Facility. 
 
 Subject to certain exceptions, borrowings under the Renewed Senior Credit Facility are secured by substantially all of the North American Loan Parties assets. The Renewed Senior Credit Facility matures on September 20, 2026. Subject to certain qualifications and exceptions, the Renewed Senior Credit Facility contains covenants that, among other things, restrict the North American Loan Parties ability to create liens, merge or consolidate, consummate acquisitions, make investments, dispose of assets, incur debt, and pay dividends and other distributions.

In order to cure any future breach of these covenants by the North American Loan Parties, the Company may repatriate cash from any of its foreign subsidiaries that are otherwise not a party to the Renewed Senior Credit Facility in an amount which, when added to the amount of the Company s Consolidated EBITDA, would result in compliance on a pro forma basis. The Company was in compliance with respect to these covenants as of July 31, 2024 . 
 
 The Renewed Senior Credit Facility contains customary events of default. If an event of default occurs and is continuing, then PNC may terminate all commitments to extend further credit and declare all amounts outstanding under the Renewed Senior Credit Facility due and payable immediately. In addition, if any of the North American Loan Parties or certain of their subsidiaries become the subject of voluntary or involuntary proceedings under any bankruptcy, insolvency or similar law, then any outstanding obligations under the Renewed Senior Credit Facility will automatically become immediately due and payable. Loans outstanding under the Renewed Senior Credit Facility will bear interest at a rate of per annum in excess of the otherwise applicable rate (i) while a bankruptcy event of default exists or (ii) upon the lender's request, during the continuance of any other event of default.

million for the purchase of its outstanding shares of common stock. Stock repurchases were permitted to be executed through open market or privately negotiated transactions, depending upon current market conditions and other factors. On December 7, 2022 the Board of Directors authorized the use of million remaining under the share repurchase program previously approved on October 4, 2021 that expired on October 3, 2022. During the twelve months ended January 31, 2024 , the Company used the remaining million authorized to repurchase its outstanding shares of common stock.

controlling financial interest and contributed assets consisting of a building and equipment. The JV is a limited liability company named Perma Pipe Gulf Arabia Industry and is a closed joint stock company established under the laws of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The JV's capital is comprised of ordinary shares with owned by the Company and remaining owned by GIG. The Company expects this collaborative business arrangement to result in expanding its market presence in Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and Bahrain. The primary business activities of the JV include the manufacture and sale of the pre-insulated piping systems and pipe coating services. GIG acquired its non-controlling interest by contributing assets to the JV of approximately million in fair value, mainly consisting of an idle building and equipment. The fair value of the net assets contributed was determined through the use of a third -party appraiser using the indirect cost method. 

Pursuant to the applicable guidance in ASC 805, Business Combinations and Noncontrolling Interests , the Company determined that the transaction did not meet the necessary conditions to be considered a business as the set of assets acquired did not contain an organized workforce and therefore was recorded as an asset acquisition. The assets transferred by the Company to the JV were recorded at historical cost, and no gain was recognized as a result of this exchange due to the Company having a controlling interest in the JV. The Company s measurement of the acquired assets is comprised of the fair value of the contributed net assets given up by the Company and the fair value of the non-controlling interest excluding the contributed assets. The non-controlling interest attributable to the other party was recorded as of the investment date and was measured as part of the carrying amount of the ownership interest in the net assets given up by the Company plus the fair value of the non-controlling interest excluding the contributed assets. No gain or loss was recognized as a result of this exchange. The Company also assumed a promissory note payable to GIG issued as part of the formation of the JV in the principal amount of million. The principal amount is presented within the Long-term debt, less current maturities caption in the Company's consolidated balance sheets. The Company also has a promissory note due from the JV that was issued as part of the formation of the JV in the amount of approximately million and eliminates in consolidation. 
 
 The Company has a controlling financial interest in the JV which is not considered a wholly owned subsidiary. Accordingly, there remains a minority portion of the equity interest that is owned by a third party, GIG. Pursuant to the applicable guidance contained in ASC 810, Consolidations , the balance sheets and operating activities of this investment are included in the Company's consolidated financial statements. T he carrying amount of the assets and liabilities of the JV that are consolidated by the Company totaled million and million, respectively, as of July 31, 2024 . 
 
 The Company adjusts net income in the consolidated statements of operations to exclude the proportionate share of results that is attributable to the non-controlling interest. Additionally, the Company presents the proportionate share that is attributable to the redeemable non-controlling interest as temporary equity within the consolidated balance sheets. This mezzanine presentation is the result of the non-controlling interest being subject to a put option that is not solely within the Company's control and in connection with the equity shares of the business arrangement that is redeemable at any time after five years following the date of formation. The redemption amount per the JV Agreement is at fair value of the non-controlling interest which represents the fair value of ordinary shares of the JV that are owned by GIG. Further, neither the call option nor put option contained in the JV Agreement met the definition of a derivative as a result of not containing a net settlement provision and the shares not being readily convertible to cash, thereby being considered embedded with respect to non-controlling interest and not a freestanding instrument. 
 
 As a result of the non-controlling interest being subject to redemption rights that are not entirely within the Company's control, it was concluded that the necessary conditions were met to be accounted for in accordance with ASC 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity . Pursuant to this accounting standard, the Company determined that the only criteria for the security to become redeemable is the passage of time and, therefore, is considered probable of redemption. The Company made a policy election to measure changes in the non-controlling interest immediately as they occur and adjust the carrying amount of non-controlling interest equal to its redemption amount as the non-controlling interest has no stated fixed price or fixed date. As such, at each subsequent balance sheet date following the formation of the JV, the Company must determine whether further adjustment is required to increase the carrying value of the redeemable non-controlling interest. If the Company determines that the fair value of the redeemable non-controlling interest exceeds its carrying value, an adjustment is made to reflect this change. However, if the value is determined to be less than its carrying value, such adjustment is limited to its original carrying value at the formation of the business arrangement. Additionally, adjustments made to reflect the change in the value of the redeemable non-controlling interest are offset against permanent equity within the Company's consolidated balance sheets. 
 
 Net income attributable to GIG was million and million for the three months ended July 31, 2024 and 2023 , respectively. Net income attributable to GIG was million and million for the six months ended July 31, 2024 and 2023 , respectively. The proportionate share of net income was accounted for as a reduction in deriving net income attributable to common stock in the Company's consolidated statements of operations. 
 
 The Company is the ultimate parent of the JV through its 60 controlling financial interest and as part of the JV Agreement majority control of the operational activities of the JV and no joint control exists. The JV Agreement has no veto or kickout rights and board voting is proportional to the ownership interest. Certain activities do include a two -thirds majority affirmative vote of shareholders of the JV and include acquiring another company, establishing new subsidiaries, entering another partnership or joint venture, engaging in any merger or materially changing the business of the JV. These are considered protective rights. The 60 equity ownership of the JV by the Company allows it to receive its proportionate share of losses and residual returns. 
 
 The non-controlling interest as measured at fair value was million and million, and was recorded within temporary equity at July 31, 2024 and January 31, 2024 , respectively. The change in non-controlling interest consists of million in current year net income attributable to non-controlling interest, and approximately million as an adjustment in the carrying value of the redeemable non-controlling interest pertaining to the business arrangement. In addition, there were no dividends or any other form of distributions from non-controlling interest for the period ended July 31, 2024 and January 31, 2024 , respectively.

 General and administrative expenses: 
 
 General and administrative expenses were 6.0 million and 5.3 million in the three months ended July 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase of 0.7 million, was due to higher payroll expenses and professional service fees in the quarter.

 Income tax expense: 
 
 The Company's ETR was 23 and 45 in the three months ended July 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The change in the ETR is due to the ability to recognize tax benefits on losses in the United States in the current year whereas the prior year had a full valuation allowance and changes in the mix of income and loss in various jurisdictions.

Revolving lines - North America 
 . On September 20, 2018, the Company and certain of its U.S. and Canadian subsidiaries (collectively, together with the Company, the North American Loan Parties entered into a Revolving Credit and Security Agreement (the Credit Agreement with PNC Bank, National Association ("PNC"), as administrative agent and lender, providing for a three-year 18 million senior secured revolving credit facility, subject to a borrowing base including various reserves (the Senior Credit Facility ).

On September 17, 2021, the North American Loan Parties executed an extension of the Credit Agreement with PNC, providing for a new five-year 18 million senior secured revolving credit facility, subject to a borrowing base including various reserves (the Renewed Senior Credit Facility ). The Company's obligations under the Renewed Senior Credit Facility are currently guaranteed by Perma-Pipe Canada, Inc. Each of the North American Loan Parties other than Perma-Pipe Canada, Inc. (collectively, the "Borrowers") is a borrower under the Renewed Senior Credit Facility.

The Borrowers have used and will continue to use borrowings under the Renewed Senior Credit Facility (i) to fund future capital expenditures; (ii) to fund ongoing working capital needs; and (iii) for other corporate purposes, including potentially additional stock repurchases. Borrowings under the Renewed Senior Credit Facility bear interest at a rate equal to an alternate base rate, SOFR rate index, plus, in each case, an applicable margin. The applicable margin is based on a fixed charge coverage ratio ("FCCR") range. Interest on alternate base rate borrowings is the alternate base rate (as defined in the Renewed Senior Credit Facility) plus an applicable margin ranging from 1.00 to 1.50 , based on the FCCR in the most recently reported period. Interest on SOFR rate borrowings is the SOFR rate (as defined in the Renewed Senior Credit Facility) plus an applicable margin ranging from 2.00 to 2.50 , based on the FCCR in the most recently reported period, as well as an additional SOFR adjustment ranging from 0.10 to 0.25 , based on the term of the interest period. Additionally, the Borrowers pay a 0.25 per annum facility fee on the unused portion of the Renewed Senior Credit Facility.

Subject to certain exceptions, borrowings under the Renewed Senior Credit Facility are secured by substantially all of the North American Loan Parties assets. The Renewed Senior Credit Facility matures on September 20, 2026. Subject to certain qualifications and exceptions, the Renewed Senior Credit Facility contains covenants that, among other things, restrict the North American Loan Parties ability to create liens, merge or consolidate, consummate acquisitions, make investments, dispose of assets, incur debt, and pay dividends and other distributions. In addition, the North American Loan Parties may not make capital expenditures in excess of 5.0 million annually, plus a limited carryover of unused amounts. Further, the North American Loan Parties may not make repurchases of the Company's common stock in excess of 3.0 million.

The Renewed Senior Credit Facility also contains financial covenants requiring the North American Loan Parties to achieve a ratio of its EBITDA (as defined in the Renewed Senior Credit Facility) to the sum of scheduled cash principal payments on indebtedness for borrowed money and interest payments on the advances under the Renewed Senior Credit Facility to be not less than 1.10 to 1.00 for any five consecutive days in which the undrawn availability is less than 3.0 million or any day in which the undrawn availability is less than 2.0 million. In order to cure any future breach of these covenants by the North American Loan Parties, the Company may repatriate cash from any of its foreign subsidiaries that are otherwise not a party to the Renewed Senior Credit Facility in an amount which, when added to the amount of the Company s Consolidated EBITDA, would result in compliance on a pro forma basis. The Company was in compliance with respect to these covenants as of 
 July 31, 2024.

The Renewed Senior Credit Facility contains customary events of default. If an event of default occurs and is continuing, then PNC may terminate all commitments to extend further credit and declare all amounts outstanding under the Renewed Senior Credit Facility due and payable immediately. In addition, if any of the North American Loan Parties or certain of their subsidiaries become the subject of voluntary or involuntary proceedings under any bankruptcy, insolvency or similar law, then any outstanding obligations under the Renewed Senior Credit Facility will automatically become immediately due and payable. Loans outstanding under the Renewed Senior Credit Facility will bear interest at a rate of 2.00 per annum in excess of the otherwise applicable rate (i) while a bankruptcy event of default exists or (ii) upon the lender's request, during the continuance of any other event of default.

As of
 July 31, 2024, the Company had borrowed an aggregate of
 6.7 
 million at a rate of 10.0 
 and had 4.7 
 million available under the Renewed Senior Credit Facility. As of January 31, 2024, the Company had borrowed an aggregate of 5.5 million and had 4.0 million available under the Renewed Senior Credit Facility.

 million at
 July 31, 2024). This credit arrangement is in the form of project financing at rates competitive in Egypt. The line is secured by certain assets (such as accounts receivable) of the Company's Egyptian subsidiary. Among other covenants, the credit arrangement established a maximum leverage ratio allowable and restricted the Company's Egyptian subsidiary's ability to undertake any additional debt. As of
 July 31, 2024, the facility has an interest rate of approximately
 20.8 
 and expires in November 2024.

Pursuant to the terms of the Purchase and Sale Agreement, the Company sold its land and buildings in Lebanon, Tennessee (the "Property") for 10.4 million. The transaction generated net cash proceeds of 9.1 million. Concurrently with the sale, the Company paid off the approximately 0.9 million mortgage note on the Property to its lender. The Company used the remaining proceeds to repay its borrowings under the Senior Credit Facility, for strategic investments, and for general corporate needs. Concurrent with the sale of the Property, the Company entered into a fifteen-year lease agreement (the Lease Agreement ), whereby the Company leases back the Property at an annual rental rate of approximately 0.8 million, subject to annual rent increases of 2.0 . Under the Lease Agreement, the Company has four consecutive options to extend the term of the lease by five years for each such option. 

In accordance with ASC 842, Leases , this transaction was recorded as a failed sale and leaseback as the present value of lease payments exceeded substantially the fair value of the underlying assets. The Company utilized an incremental borrowing rate of 8.0 to determine the finance obligation to record for the amounts received and will continue to depreciate the assets. The current portion of the finance obligation of 0.2 million is recognized in current maturities of long-term debt and the long-term portion of 8.9 million is recognized in long-term finance obligation on the Company's consolidated balance sheets as of July 31, 2024 
 . The net carrying amount of the financial liability and remaining assets will be zero at the end of the lease term.

Accounts receivable: 

In 2015, the Company completed a project in the Middle East with billings in the aggregate amount of approximately 41.9 million. The system has not yet been commissioned by the customer. Nevertheless, the Company has received approximately 
 40.1 million as of
 July 31, 2024, with a remaining balance due in the amount of 
 1.8 million, all of which pertains to retention clauses within the agreements with the Company's customer, and which become payable by the customer when this project is fully tested and commissioned. Of this amount, 
 1.3 million is classified in other
 long-term assets on the Company's consolidated balance sheets. 

The Company has been actively involved in ongoing efforts to collect this outstanding balance. The Company continues to engage with the customer to ensure full payment of the open balances, and during the 
 six months ended July 31, 2024, and at various times throughout 2023, the Company received partial payments to settle 
 0.3 million and 
 0.6 million, respectively, of the customer's outstanding balances. Further, the Company has been engaged by the customer to perform additional work in 2024 under customary trade terms that supports the continued cooperation between the Company and the customer. As a result, the Company did not reserve any allowance against the remaining outstanding balances as of 
 July 31, 2024. However, if the Company's efforts to collect on this account are not successful, the Company may recognize an allowance for all, or substantially all, of any such then uncollected amounts.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES 
 
 Critical accounting policies are described in Item 7. MD A and in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended January 31, 2024 contained in the Company's latest Annual Report on Form 10-K. Any new accounting policies or updates to existing accounting policies as a result of new accounting pronouncements have been discussed in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The application of critical accounting policies may require management to make assumptions, judgments and estimates about the amounts reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Management uses historical experience and all available information to make these estimates and judgments, and different amounts could be reported using different assumptions and estimates.

Item 4. 
 Controls and Procedures 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 The Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have evaluated the effectiveness of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) as of July 31, 2024. This evaluation included consideration of the controls, processes and procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports the Company files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and to provide reasonable assurance that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on this evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective because of the material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting, as described below. 
 
 Material Weaknesses in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
 A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company's annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. 
 
 There are material weaknesses in the Company's internal control over financial reporting, as follows. 
 
 We did not design and maintain effective controls in response to the risks of material misstatement. Specifically, changes to existing controls or the implementation of new controls have not been sufficient to respond to changes to the risks of material misstatement in financial reporting. This contributed to the following material weaknesses: 
 
 We did not design and maintain effective controls over information technology general controls ("ITGC"), specifically related to the policies and procedures over the timely review of security management and monitoring, user access and security administration, password control, administrative access, program change management, data security and back up, review of third-party SOC1 reports, and related management's review of the completeness and accuracy of certain system-generated reports. These material weaknesses did not result in a misstatement to the Company's annual or interim financial statements. 
 
 Additionally, we did not design and maintain effective controls over certain controls over financial reporting relating to the review and approval of manual journal entries, review of the financial close process, including the statement of cash flows, and review of certain financial policies and procedures and respective HR policies. We also did not design and maintain effective controls at operating locations in the Middle East and North Africa ("MENA"), including not maintaining sufficient documentation to support an evaluation that controls over business processes were designed and operating effectively. These material weaknesses, which were determined to have existed as of January 31, 2024, and April 30, 2024, resulted in adjustments to property, plant, and equipment, net of accumulated depreciation, trade accounts payable, trade accounts receivable, and the statement of cash flows. These adjustments resulted in a revision of the unaudited consolidated financial statements as of and for the period ended April 30, 2024, and a restatement as of and for the period ended July 31, 2024. Additionally, there is a reasonable possibility that each of these material weaknesses could result in material misstatements of substantially all accounts and disclosures in the Company's annual or interim financial statements that would not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. 
 
 Remediation Plan for the Material Weaknesses in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 To address these matters, the Company has begun implementing its remediation plan. Our ongoing remediation plans include the following: 
 
 (i) designing and implementing controls to identify and evaluate changes in our business and the impact on our internal control over financial reporting; (ii) addressing the identified issues with control owners, including Company leadership and IT personnel; (iii) engaging outside consultants with expertise relating to ITGCs to document processes, assist in addressing the design and operating ITGCs controls, monitoring and testing reviews focusing on systems supporting our financial reporting process (iv) developing and maintaining controls and documentation evidencing those controls underlying ITGCs for knowledge transfer and function changes, including access and program control and change management, data security and back up, reviewing third party SOC1 reports, and reviewing the completeness and accuracy of certain system-generated reports;; and (v) outsourcing certain functions to third-party providers, specifically relating to servers and firewalls, and managed detection and response. 
 
 Our remediation plans related to entity level controls, financial reporting controls, and business process controls include: 
 
 (i) enhancing the design of controls for the review of and posting of a complete set of journal entries; (ii) evaluating and updating documented formal accounting policies, financial reporting, HR, and financial processes; and overall internal control procedures; and (iii) updating the design of controls for the preparation and review of the statement of cash flows. 
 
 Our remediation plans related to our MENA locations include: (i) addressing issues with control owners, including company leadership; (ii) evaluating and updating the Company's evidence of internal control policies and procedures as needed and providing necessary guidance to applicable locations; (iii) assessing the adequacy and determine whether enhancements are needed to the design of corporate and / or operating locations business process controls; and (iv) augmenting our internal audit function by hiring an additional resource to assist in overseeing the remediation process, including updating policies and procedures, and implementing internal controls; and (v) engaging outside consultants to conduct training sessions. 
 
 The Company anticipates the actions described above and resulting improvements in controls will strengthen the Company's processes, procedures and will address the related material weaknesses described above. However, the material weaknesses cannot be considered fully remediated until the necessary controls have been appropriately designed and implemented. The remediation processes and procedures will also need to be in operation for a period of time and management conclude through testing, that these controls are operating effectively. 
 
 Change in Internal Control over Financial Reporting . There were no changes to our internal control over financial reporting which were identified in connection with the evaluation required by Rules 13a-15(d) or 15d-15(d) under the Exchange Act during the fiscal quarter ended July 31, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
