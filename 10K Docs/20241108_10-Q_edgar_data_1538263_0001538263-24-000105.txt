The amount of cash consideration paid at closing was reduced by the amount withdrawn during this time period. 
 Goodwill of arising from the merger consisted largely of synergies and the cost saves resulting from the combining of operations of the companies, and is not expected to be deductible for income tax purposes.

 The total number of securities with unrealized losses at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were and , respectively. 
 Management evaluates securities for impairment where there has been a decline in fair value below the amortized cost basis of a security to determine whether there is a credit loss associated with the decline in fair value on at least a quarterly basis, and more frequently when economic or market concerns warrant such evaluation. All debt securities available for sale in an unrealized loss position as of September 30, 2024 continue to perform as scheduled and management does not believe that there is a credit loss or that a provision for credit losses is necessary. Also, as part of management's evaluation of its intent and ability to hold investments for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in the market, management considers its investment strategy, cash flow needs, liquidity position, capital adequacy and interest rate risk position. Management does not currently intend to sell the securities within the portfolio and it is not more-likely-than-not that securities will be required to be sold. See "Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" in our 2023 Form 10-KT for further discussion. 
 Management continues to monitor all of its securities with a high degree of scrutiny. There can be no assurance that management will not conclude in future periods that conditions existing at that time indicate some or all of its securities may be sold or would require a charge to earnings as a provision for credit losses in such periods. 
 Management excludes the accrued interest receivable balance from the amortized cost basis in measuring ECL on investment securities and does not record an ACL on accrued interest receivable. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, accrued interest receivable for debt securities available for sale was and , respectively.

 All qualifying one-to-four family loans, HELOCs, commercial real estate loans and FHLB of Atlanta stock are pledged as collateral by a blanket pledge to secure outstanding FHLB advances. 
 Loans are made to the Company's executive officers, directors and their associates during the ordinary course of business. The aggregate amount of loans to such related parties totaled approximately and at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. In relation to these loans are unfunded commitments that totaled approximately at both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 Loans are monitored for credit quality on a recurring basis and the composition of the loans outstanding by credit quality indicator is provided below. Loan credit quality indicators are developed through review of individual borrowers on an ongoing basis. Generally, loans are monitored for performance on a quarterly basis with the credit quality indicators adjusted as needed. The indicators represent the rating for loans as of the date presented based on the most recent assessment performed. These credit quality indicators are defined as follows: 
 Pass A pass rated loan is not adversely classified because it does not display any of the characteristics for adverse classification. 
 Special Mention A special mention loan has potential weaknesses that deserve management s close attention. If left uncorrected, such potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects or collateral position at some future date. Special mention loans are not adversely classified and do not warrant adverse classification. 
 Substandard A substandard loan is inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor, or of the collateral pledged, if any. Loans classified as substandard generally have a well-defined weakness, or weaknesses, that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt. These loans are characterized by the distinct possibility of loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. 
 Doubtful A loan classified as doubtful has all the weaknesses inherent in a loan classified substandard with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full highly questionable and improbable, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions and values. 
 Loss Loans classified as loss are considered uncollectible and of such little value that their continuing to be carried as a loan is not warranted. This classification is not necessarily equivalent to no potential for recovery or salvage value, but rather that it is not appropriate to defer a full write-off even though partial recovery may be effected in the future.

 Modifications to Borrowers Experiencing Financial Difficulty 
 The Company modifies loans to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty by providing principal forgiveness, a term extension, an other-than-insignificant payment delay or interest rate adjustments. In some cases, the Company provides multiple types of modifications on one loan. Typically, one type of modification, such as a term extension, is granted initially. If the borrower continues to experience financial difficulty, another modification, such as principal forgiveness, may be granted. For loans included in the combination columns in the table below, multiple types of modifications have been made on the same loan within the current reporting period.

 Off-Balance Sheet Credit Exposure 
 The Company maintains a separate reserve for credit losses on off-balance sheet credit exposures, including unfunded loan commitments, which is included in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. The reserve for credit losses on off-balance sheet credit exposures is adjusted as a provision for credit losses in the consolidated statement of income. The estimate includes consideration of the likelihood that funding will occur and an estimate of ECLs on commitments expected to be funded over its estimated life, utilizing the same models and approaches for the Company's other loan portfolio segments described above, as these unfunded commitments share similar risk characteristics as its loan portfolio segments. The Company has identified the unfunded portion of certain lines of credit as unconditionally cancellable credit exposures, meaning the Company can cancel the unfunded commitment at any time. No credit loss estimate is reported for off-balance sheet credit exposures that are unconditionally cancellable by the Company or for undrawn amounts under such arrangements that may be drawn prior to the cancellation of the arrangement. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , the ACL on off-balance sheet credit exposures included in other liabilities was and , respectively.

The proceeds from the issuance of the common securities and the trust preferred securities were used by the Trust to purchase of junior subordinated debentures of Quantum. As a result of its merger with Quantum on February 12, 2023, HomeTrust became the successor owner of the Trust. 
 The trust preferred securities accrue and pay quarterly distributions at a floating rate of 3-month Term SOFR plus , which was at September 30, 2024. The Company has guaranteed distributions and other payments due on the trust preferred securities to the extent the Trust has insufficient funds with which to make the distributions and other payments. The net combined effect of all documents entered into in connection with the trust preferred securities is that the Company is liable to make the distributions and other payments required on the trust preferred securities. 
 The trust preferred securities are mandatorily redeemable upon maturity of the debentures on March 15, 2037, or upon earlier redemption as provided in the indenture. The Company has the right to redeem the debentures purchased by the Trust, in whole or in part, on or after March 15, 2012.

When it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise our option to renew or extend the lease term, that option is included in estimating the value of the ROU and lease liability. The Company's lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants. Most of the Company's lease agreements include periodic rate adjustments for inflation. The depreciable life of ROU assets and leasehold improvements are limited to the shorter of the useful life or the expected lease term. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet. The Company recognizes lease expenses for these leases over the lease term.

 (1) Fixed rate commitments had terms ranging from three to years as of each date presented. 
 (2) Principally second mortgage home equity loans and overdraft protection loans. 
 The commitments presented in the above table represent the Company s exposure to credit risk and, in the opinion of management, have no more than the normal lending risk that the Company commits to its borrowers. 
 The Company has two types of commitments related to certain one-to-four family loans held for sale: rate lock commitments and forward loan commitments. Rate lock commitments are commitments to extend credit to a customer that has an interest rate lock and are considered derivative instruments. The rate lock commitments do not qualify for hedge accounting. In order to mitigate the risk from interest rate fluctuations, the Company enters into forward loan sale commitments such as TBAs, mandatory delivery commitments with investors, or best efforts forward sale commitments with investors. The fair value of these interest rate lock commitments was not material at September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023. 
 SBIC Commitments As of September 30, 2024, the Company had committed across SBIC investments with remaining to be drawn, while as of December 31, 2023, the Company had committed across SBIC investments with remaining to be drawn. Although the remaining capital commitments may or may not be called in the future, under the terms of the associated limited partnership agreements, the Company's exposure will not extend beyond the amount of the original commitments. 
 Guarantees Standby letters of credit obligate the Company to meet certain financial obligations of its customers, if, under the contractual terms of the agreement, the customers are unable to do so. The financial standby letters of credit issued by the Company are irrevocable and payment is only guaranteed upon the borrower's failure to perform its obligations to the beneficiary. Total commitments under standby letters of credit as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were and , respectively. There was no liability recorded for these letters of credit at September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023. 
 Litigation From time to time, the Company is involved in litigation matters in the ordinary course of business. These proceedings and the associated legal claims are often contested, and the outcome of individual matters is not always predictable. These claims and counter claims typically arise during the course of collection efforts on problem loans or with respect to actions to enforce liens on properties in which the Company holds a security interest. The Company is not a party to any pending legal proceedings that management believes would have a material adverse effect on the Company s financial condition or results of operations .

 A loan is considered to be collateral dependent when, based on current information and events, the Company expects repayment of the financial assets to be provided substantially through the operation or sale of the collateral and the Company has determined that the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty as of the measurement date. For real estate loans, the fair value of the loan's collateral is determined by a third-party appraisal, which is then adjusted for the estimated selling and closing costs related to liquidation of the collateral (typically ranging from to of the appraised value). For this asset class, the actual valuation methods (income, sales comparable or cost) vary based on the status of the project or property.

Overview 
 HomeTrust Bancshares, Inc., a Maryland corporation, was formed for the purpose of becoming the holding company for HomeTrust Bank in connection with the Bank s conversion from mutual to stock form, which was completed on July 10, 2012. As a bank holding company and financial holding company, we are regulated by the Federal Reserve. At September 30, 2024, the Company had consolidated total assets of 4.6 billion, total deposits of 3.8 billion and stockholders' equity of 540.0 million. The Company has not engaged in any significant activity other than holding the stock of the Bank. Accordingly, the information set forth in this Form 10-Q, including the consolidated unaudited financial statements and related data, relates primarily to the Bank and its subsidiary. As a North Carolina state-chartered bank, and member of the FRB, the Bank's primary regulators are the NCCOB and the Federal Reserve. The Bank's deposits are federally insured up to applicable limits by the FDIC. The Bank is a member of the FHLB of Atlanta, which is one of the 11 regional banks in the FHLB System. Our headquarters is located in Asheville, North Carolina. 
 The Bank has more than 30 locations across Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee and Virginia, many of which are located in markets experiencing growth rates above the national average. Historically, our branches and facilities have primarily been located in small- to medium-sized communities, but in recent years we have implemented a strategy of expanding into larger, higher growth markets via business banking centers rather than retail-focused branches. 
 Our principal business consists of attracting deposits from the general public and investing those funds, along with borrowed funds, in commercial real estate loans, construction and development loans, commercial and industrial loans, equipment finance leases, municipal leases, loans secured by first and second mortgages on one-to-four family residences including home equity and other consumer loans. We also originate one-to-four family loans, SBA loans and HELOCs to sell to third-parties. In addition, we invest in debt securities issued by United States Government agencies and GSEs, municipal bonds, corporate bonds, commercial paper and certificates of deposit insured by the FDIC. We offer a variety of deposit accounts for individuals, businesses and nonprofit organizations. 
 Our primary source of pre-tax income is net interest income. Net interest income is the difference between interest income, which is the income that we earn on our loans and investments, and interest expense, which is the interest that we pay on our deposits and borrowings. Changes in levels of interest rates affect our net interest income. A secondary source of income is noninterest income, which includes revenue we receive from providing products and services including service charges and fees on deposit accounts, loan income and fees, gains on sale of loans held for sale, BOLI income and operating lease income. 
 An offset to net interest income is the provision for credit losses to establish the ACL at a level that provides for ECLs inherent in our loan portfolio, off balance sheet commitments and available for sale debt securities. See "Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" in Item 1 of our 2023 Form 10-KT for further discussion. 
 Our noninterest expenses consist primarily of salaries and employee benefits, occupancy expenses, marketing and computer services and FDIC deposit insurance premiums. Salaries and benefits consist primarily of the salaries and wages paid to our employees, payroll taxes, expenses for retirement and other employee benefits. Occupancy expenses, which are the fixed and variable costs of buildings and equipment, consist primarily of lease payments, property taxes, depreciation charges, maintenance and costs of utilities. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 Certain of our accounting policies are important to the portrayal of our financial condition, since they require management to make difficult, complex or subjective judgments, some of which may relate to matters that are inherently uncertain. Estimates associated with these policies are susceptible to material changes as a result of changes in facts and circumstances which could include, but are not limited to, changes in interest rates, changes in the performance of the economy and changes in the financial condition of borrowers. The following represents our critical accounting policy: 
 Allowance for Credit Losses, or ACL, on Loans. The ACL on loans held for investment reflects our estimate of credit losses that will result from the inability of our borrowers to make required loan payments. We charge off loans against the ACL and subsequent recoveries, if any, increase the ACL when they are recognized. We use a systematic methodology to determine our ACL for loans held for investment and certain off-balance-sheet credit exposures. The ACL on loans held for investment is a valuation account that is deducted from the amortized cost basis to present the net amount expected to be collected on the loan portfolio. The estimate of our ACL on loans held for investment involves a high degree of judgment including consideration of the effects of past events, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts on the collectability of the loan portfolio. We recognize in net income the amount needed to adjust the ACL on loans held for investment and certain off-balance-sheet credit exposures for management s current estimate of ECLs. Our ACL on loans held for investment is calculated using collectively evaluated and individually evaluated loans.

Comparison of Results of Operations for the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024 
 Net Income. Net income totaled 13.1 million, or 0.76 per diluted share, for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 12.4 million, or 0.73 per diluted share, for the three months ended June 30, 2024, an increase of 694,000, or 5.6 . Results for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were positively impacted by a decrease of 1.3 million in the provision for credit losses. Details of the changes in the various components of net income are further discussed below. 
 Net Interest Income. The following table presents the distribution of average assets, liabilities and equity, as well as interest income earned on average interest-earning assets and interest expense paid on average interest-bearing liabilities. All average balances are daily average balances. Nonaccruing loans have been included in the table as loans carrying a zero yield.

 (1) Average loans receivable balances include loans held for sale and nonaccruing loans. 
 (2) Average other interest-earning assets consist of FRB stock, FHLB stock, SBIC investments and deposits in other banks. 
 (3) Net interest income divided by average interest-earning assets. 
 (4) Tax-equivalent results include adjustments to interest income of 368 and 354 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, respectively, calculated based on a combined federal and state tax rate of 24 . 
 Total interest and dividend income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 1.2 million, or 1.9 , compared to the three months ended June 30, 2024, which was driven by a 1.1 million, or 1.8 , increase in loan interest income primarily due to the difference in the number of days in each quarter. Accretion income on acquired loans of 640,000 and 678,000 was recognized during the same periods, respectively, and was included in interest income on loans. 
 37 

Total interest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 1.3 million, or 5.7 , compared to the three months ended June 30, 2024. The increase was primarily the result of increases in the average balances of money market and certificate accounts, partially offset by a decline in average borrowings outstanding. 
 The following table shows the effects that changes in average balances (volume), including the difference in the number of days in the periods compared, and average interest rates (rate) had on the interest earned on interest-earning assets and interest paid on interest-bearing liabilities: 
 Increase / (Decrease) Due to Total Increase / (Decrease) (Dollars in thousands) Volume Rate Interest-earning assets Loans receivable 916 228 1,144 Debt securities available for sale 83 38 121 Other interest-earning assets 76 (106) (30) Total interest-earning assets 1,075 160 1,235 Interest-bearing liabilities Interest-bearing checking accounts (81) (86) (167) Money market accounts 413 123 536 Savings accounts (1) (1) Certificate accounts 1,341 300 1,641 Junior subordinated debt 3 (2) 1 Borrowings (708) 25 (683) Total interest-bearing liabilities 967 360 1,327 Decrease in net interest income (92) 
 Provision for Credit Losses. The provision for credit losses is the amount of expense that, based on our judgment, is required to maintain the ACL at an appropriate level under the current expected credit losses model. 
 The following table presents a breakdown of the components of the provision for credit losses: 
 Three Months Ended (Dollars in thousands) September 30, 2024 
 June 30, 2024 
 Change Change Provision for credit losses Loans 2,990 4,300 (1,310) (30) Off-balance-sheet credit exposure (15) (40) 25 63 Total provision for credit losses 2,975 4,260 (1,285) (30) 
 For the quarter ended September 30, 2024 , the "loans" portion of the provision for credit losses was the result of the following, offset by net charge-offs of 4.1 million during the quarter: 
 0.4 million benefit driven by changes in the loan mix. 
 1.2 million provision due to changes in the projected economic forecast, specifically the national unemployment rate, and changes in qualitative adjustments. Included in this change was the addition of a 2.2 million qualitative allocation for the potential impact of Hurricane Helene upon our loan portfolio. 
 1.9 million decrease in specific reserves on individually evaluated loans as we charged-off specific reserves which had previously been established. 
 For the quarter ended June 30, 2024 , the "loans" portion of the provision for credit losses was the result of the following, in addition to net charge-offs of 2.6 million during the quarter: 
 0.1 million provision driven by changes in the loan mix. 
 0.4 million benefit due to changes in the projected economic forecast and changes in qualitative adjustments. 
 2.0 million increase in specific reserves on individually evaluated loans which was proportional to the increase in the associated loan balances which increased from 8.3 million to 16.3 million quarter-over-quarter, concentrated in the equipment finance and SBA portfolios. 
 For the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024 , the amounts recorded for off-balance-sheet credit exposure were the result of changes in the balance of loan commitments, loan mix and projected economic forecast as outlined above. 
 
 38 

Noninterest Income. Noninterest income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 169,000, or 2.1 , when compared to the quarter ended June 30, 2024. Changes in the components of noninterest income are discussed below: 
 Three Months Ended (Dollars in thousands) September 30, 2024 
 June 30, 2024 
 Change Change Noninterest income Service charges and fees on deposit accounts 2,336 2,354 (18) (1) Loan income and fees 684 647 37 6 Gain on sale of loans held for sale 1,900 1,828 72 4 BOLI income 828 807 21 3 Operating lease income 1,637 1,591 46 3 Other 897 886 11 1 Total noninterest income 8,282 8,113 169 2 
 Gain on sale of loans held for sale: The increase was primarily driven by residential mortgage loans sold during the period. There were 21.7 million of residential mortgage loans originated for sale which were sold during the current quarter with gains of 479,000 compared to 21.3 million sold with gains of 351,000 in the prior quarter , with the improvement in profitability due to movement in interest rates . There were 54.6 million of HELOCs sold for a gain of 414,000 compared to 32.9 million sold with gains of 457,000 in the prior quarter. There were 12.9 million in sales of the guaranteed portion of SBA commercial loans with gains of 1.0 million for the quarter compared to 12.7 million sold and gains of 1.1 million for the prior quarter. Our hedging of mandatory commitments on the residential mortgage loan pipeline resulted in a gain of 18,000 for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 versus a loss of 58,000 for the quarter ended June 30, 2024. 
 Noninterest Expense. Noninterest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 375,000, or 1.2 , when compared to the three months ended June 30, 2024. Changes in the components of noninterest expense are discussed below: 
 Three Months Ended (Dollars in thousands) September 30, 2024 
 June 30, 2024 
 Change Change Noninterest expense Salaries and employee benefits 17,082 16,608 474 3 Occupancy expense, net 2,436 2,419 17 1 Computer services 3,192 3,116 76 2 Telephone, postage and supplies 547 580 (33) (6) Marketing and advertising 408 606 (198) (33) Deposit insurance premiums 589 531 58 11 Core deposit intangible amortization 567 567 Other 5,764 5,783 (19) Total noninterest expense 30,585 30,210 375 1 
 Salaries and employee benefits: The quarter-over-quarter increase was primarily the result of executive pay increases effective this quarter and additional stock incentive expense associated with the vesting of performance-based equity awards. 
 Marketing and advertising: The decrease in expense was the result of both differences in the timing of when expenses were incurred quarter-over-quarter as well as a reduction in traditional media advertising (print, billboards, etc.) in favor of digital platforms at lower costs. 
 Income Taxes. The amount of income tax expense is influenced by the amount of pre-tax income, tax-exempt income, changes in the statutory rate and the effect of changes in valuation allowances maintained against deferred tax benefits. The effective tax rates for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024 were 21.9 and 21.4 , respectively. 
 
 Comparison of Results of Operations for the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 
 Net Income. Net income totaled 40.6 million, or 2.37 per diluted share, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 36.6 million, or 2.18 per diluted share, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 4.0 million, or 11.0 . The results for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were positively impacted by a decrease of 3.3 million in the provision for credit losses, a 1.4 million increase in noninterest income, and a 2.6 million decrease in noninterest expense, partially offset by a 2.0 million decrease in net interest income and a 1.3 million increase in income tax expense. Details of the changes in the various components of net income are further discussed below.

 (1) Average loans receivable balances include loans held for sale and nonaccruing loans. 
 (2) Average other interest-earning assets consist of FRB stock, FHLB stock, SBIC investments and deposits in other banks. 
 (3) Net interest income divided by average interest-earning assets. 
 (4) Tax-equivalent results include adjustments to interest income of 1,072 and 903 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively, calculated based on a combined federal and state tax rate of 24 . 
 Total interest and dividend income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 23.8 million, or 13.8 , compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, which was driven by a 22.9 million, or 14.1 , increase in interest income on loans. Accretion income on acquired loans of 2.0 million and 1.7 million was recognized during the same periods, respectively, and was included in interest income on loans. The overall increase in average yield on interest-earning assets was the result of both higher average balances and rising interest rates. 
 Total interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 25.8 million, or 58.4 , compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The change was primarily the result of increases in the cost of funds across all funding sources driven by higher market interest rates and increases in the average balances of money market and certificate accounts, partially offset by a decline in average borrowings outstanding.

 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , the "loans" portion of the provision for credit losses was the result of net charge-offs of 8.9 million during the period, partially offset by a 0.4 million benefit due to changes in the loan mix. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the "loans" portion of the provision for credit losses was the result of the following, in addition to net charge-offs of 3.9 million during the period: 
 4.9 million provision to establish an allowance on Quantum's loan portfolio. 
 3.0 million provision due to changes in the projected economic forecast, specifically the national unemployment rate, and changes in qualitative adjustments. 
 0.3 million increase in specific reserves on individually evaluated credits. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, the amounts recorded for off-balance-sheet credit exposure were the result of changes in the balance of loan commitments, loan mix and projected economic forecast as outlined above.

Noninterest Income. Noninterest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 1.4 million, or 5.8 , when compared to the same period last year. Changes in the components of noninterest income are discussed below: 
 Nine Months Ended 
 (Dollars in thousands) September 30, 2024

 Gain on sale of loans held for sale: The increase in the gain on sale of loans held for sale was primarily driven by residential mortgage and SBA loans sold during the period. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, there were 58.3 million of residential mortgage loans originated for sale which were sold with gains of 1.1 million compared to 48.7 million sold with gains of 633,000 for the corresponding period in the prior year, with the improvement in profitability due to movement in interest rates. There were 38.5 million of sales of the guaranteed portion of SBA commercial loans with gains of 3.1 million compared to 41.1 million sold and gains of 2.6 million for the corresponding period in the prior year. There were 95.4 million of HELOCs sold during the current period for a gain of 887,000 compared to 66.4 million sold and gains of 552,000 for the corresponding period in the prior year. Our hedging of mandatory commitments on the residential mortgage loan pipeline resulted in a gain of 15,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 versus a gain of 426,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 BOLI income: The increase was due to higher yielding policies as a result of restructuring the portfolio at the end of the prior calendar year. 
 Operating lease income: The increase in operating lease income was the result of 1.7 million in additional contractual earnings on a higher average outstanding balance of the associated contracts, partially offset by losses incurred on previously leased equipment, where we recognized a net loss of 1.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 versus a net loss of 210,000 in the same period last year. 
 Gain (loss) on sale of premises and equipment: During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, two properties were sold for a combined gain of 982,000. No material disposal activity occurred during the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

 Salaries and employee benefits : The increase was primarily the result of pay increases, partially offset by reductions in incentive pay. 
 Core deposit intangible amortization: The intangible recorded associated with the Quantum merger is being amortized on an accelerated basis, so the rate of amortization slowed year-over-year. 
 Merger-related expenses: The prior period included expenses associated with the Company's merger with Quantum. No such expenses were incurred in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Other: The increase period-over-period was primarily driven by 1.7 million of additional depreciation expense on equipment subject to operating leases. 
 Income Taxes. The amount of income tax expense is influenced by the amount of pre-tax income, tax-exempt income, changes in the statutory rate and the effect of changes in valuation allowances maintained against deferred tax benefits. The effective tax rates for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 were 21.3 and 21.0 , respectively.

Comparison of Financial Condition at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 
 General. Total assets decreased by 35.3 million to 4.6 billion and total liabilities decreased by 75.5 million to 4.1 billion, respectively, at September 30, 2024 as compared to December 31, 2023. The majority of these changes were the result of an increase in deposits, which, combined with the collection of BOLI redemption proceeds and cash and cash equivalents, were used to fund growth in loans and pay down borrowings. 
 Cash and Cash Equivalents. Total cash and cash equivalents decreased 53.7 million, or 15.5 , to 293.5 million at September 30, 2024 from 347.1 million at December 31, 2023. 
 Debt Securities Available for Sale. Debt securities available for sale increased 13.6 million, or 10.7 , to 140.6 million at September 30, 2024 from 127.0 million at December 31, 2023. Outside of changes in value, the changes between periods were the result of 33.3 million in purchases, partially offset by 22.6 million in proceeds from the maturity, call and paydown of securities. 
 Loans Held for Sale. Loans held for sale decreased 9.1 million, or 4.5 , to 192.7 million at September 30, 2024 from 201.8 million at December 31, 2023. This was driven by decreases in all loans held for sale categories. 
 Loans, Net of Deferred Loan Fees and Costs. Total loans increased 58.9 million, or 1.6 , to 3.7 billion at September 30, 2024. The following table illustrates the changes within the portfolio:

 Asset Quality. Nonperforming assets, made up of nonaccrual loans and repossessed assets, increased by 10.4 million, or 54.0 , to 29.8 million, or 0.64 of total assets, at September 30, 2024 compared to 19.3 million, or 0.41 of total assets, at December 31, 2023. Consistent with the change in net charge-offs discussed below, equipment finance loans made up the largest portion of nonperforming assets at 8.5 million and 6.5 million, respectively, at these same dates. In addition, owner occupied commercial real estate totaled 7.2 million and 912,000, respectively, at these same dates. These increases were mainly the result of a 3.1 million medical equipment relationship and a 5.1 million owner occupied commercial real estate (OO CRE) relationship; however, in both cases losses are not currently anticipated. The ratio of nonperforming loans to total loans was 0.78 at September 30, 2024 compared to 0.53 at December 31, 2023. 
 The ratio of classified assets to total assets increased to 0.99 at September 30, 2024 from 0.90 at December 31, 2023 as classified assets increased 4.1 million, or 9.8 , to 46.1 million at September 30, 2024 compared to 42.0 million at December 31, 2023. The largest portfolios of classified assets at September 30, 2024 included 11.7 million of non-owner occupied commercial real estate loans, 8.4 million of equipment finance loans, 7.1 million of SBA loans, 6.0 million of 1-4 family residential real estate loans, and 6.0 million of OO CRE loans. 
 Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans. The ACL on loans was 48.1 million, or 1.30 of total loans, at September 30, 2024 compared to 48.6 million, or 1.34 of total loans, as of December 31, 2023. The drivers of this change are discussed in the "Comparison of Results of Operations for the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 Provision for Credit Losses" section above. 
 Net loan charge-offs totaled 8.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 3.9 million for the same period last year. As discussed in previous quarters, the increase in net charge-offs has been concentrated in our equipment finance portfolio, primarily smaller over-the-road truck loans, with net charge-offs of 5.1 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. In response, during the first quarter of calendar year 2024 the Company elected to cease further originations within the transportation sector of equipment finance loans. In spite of the increase, annualized net charge-offs as a percentage of average assets for the loan portfolio as a whole were 0.31 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, in line with the Company's historical experience, as compared to 0.14 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

Other Assets. Other assets decreased by 39.3 million, or 36.6 , to 68.1 million at September 30, 2024 from 107.4 million at December 31, 2023. During the quarter ended December 31, 2023, we had established a 47.9 million receivable for proceeds from the redemption of BOLI policies. The decrease between periods was due to the collection of 44.3 million of this receivable. 
 Deposits. The following table summarizes the composition of our deposit portfolio as of the dates indicated:

 Liquidity Management 
 Management maintains a liquidity position that it believes will adequately provide for funding of loan demand and deposit run-off that may occur in the normal course of business. We rely on a number of different sources in order to meet our potential liquidity demands. The primary sources are increases in deposit accounts, wholesale borrowings and cash flows from loan payments and the securities portfolio. 
 In addition to these primary sources of funds, management has several secondary sources available to meet potential funding requirements. All qualifying one-to-four family loans, HELOCs, commercial real estate loans, multifamily loans and FHLB of Atlanta stock are pledged as collateral to secure outstanding FHLB advances while commercial construction, indirect auto, and equipment and municipal leases are pledged as collateral to secure outstanding FRB advances. At September 30, 2024, the Company had the ability to borrow 162.2 million through FHLB advances and 170.5 million through the unused portion of a line of credit with the FRB. At this same date, the Company maintained revolving lines of credit with three unaffiliated banks, the unused portion of which totaled 159.0 million. HomeTrust had drawn 6.0 million on a 40.0 million revolving line of credit which bears interest at The Wall Street Journal prime rate plus 50 basis points, maturing on January 28, 2025, although the term may be extended for an additional year if no events of default have occurred. 
 Additionally, we classify our securities portfolio as available for sale, providing an additional source of liquidity. Management believes that our securities portfolio is of high quality, of short duration, and the securities would therefore be readily marketable. In addition, we have historically sold fixed-rate mortgage loans in the secondary market to reduce interest rate risk and to create still another source of liquidity. From time to time we also utilize brokered time deposits to supplement our other sources of funds. Brokered time deposits are obtained by utilizing an outside broker that is paid a fee. This funding requires advance notification to structure the type of deposit desired by us. Brokered deposits can vary in term from one month to several years and have the benefit of being a source of longer-term funding. We also utilize brokered deposits to help manage interest rate risk by extending the term to repricing of our liabilities, enhance our liquidity and fund asset growth. Brokered deposits are typically from outside our primary market areas, and our brokered deposit levels may vary from time to time depending on competitive interest rate conditions and other factors. At September 30, 2024, brokered deposits totaled 422.2 million, or 11.2 of total deposits. 
 Liquidity management is both a daily and long-term function of business management. Excess liquidity is generally invested in short-term investments, such as overnight deposits and federal funds. On a longer term basis, we maintain a strategy of investing in various lending products and debt securities, including MBS. On a stand-alone level we are a separate legal entity from the Bank and must provide for our own liquidity and pay our own operating expenses. Our primary source of funds consists of dividends or capital distributions from the Bank, although there are regulatory restrictions on the ability of the Bank to pay dividends. At September 30, 2024, we (on an unconsolidated basis) had liquid assets of 1.1 million. 
 At the Bank level, we use our sources of funds primarily to meet our ongoing commitments, pay maturing deposits and fund withdrawals and to fund loan commitments. At September 30, 2024, the total approved loan commitments and unused lines of credit outstanding amounted to 246.9 million and 689.0 million, respectively, as compared to 240.9 million and 690.6 million as of December 31, 2023. Certificates of deposit scheduled to mature in one year or less at September 30, 2024 totaled 963.5 million. It is management's policy to manage deposit rates that are competitive with other local financial institutions. Based on this strategy, we believe that a majority of maturing deposits will be retained. 
 
 Off-Balance Sheet Activities 
 In the normal course of operations, we engage in a variety of financial transactions that are not recorded in our financial statements, mainly to manage customers' requests for funding. These transactions primarily take the form of loan commitments and lines of credit and involve varying degrees of off-balance sheet credit, interest rate and liquidity risks. For further information, see "Note 12 Commitments and Contingencies" in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 
 Capital Resources 
 HomeTrust Bancshares, Inc. is a bank holding company subject to regulation by the Federal Reserve. As a bank holding company, we are subject to capital adequacy requirements of the Federal Reserve under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended and the regulations of the Federal Reserve. The Company's subsidiary, the Bank, an FDIC-insured, North Carolina state-chartered bank and a member of the Federal Reserve System, is supervised and regulated by the Federal Reserve and the NCCOB and is subject to minimum capital requirements applicable to state member banks established by the Federal Reserve that are calculated in a manner similar to those applicable to bank holding companies. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possibly discretionary actions by bank regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the Company's financial statements. 
 44 

Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, the Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of the Bank s assets, liabilities and certain off-balance-sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. The Bank s capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings and other factors. 
 At September 30, 2024, HomeTrust Bancshares, Inc. and the Bank each exceeded all regulatory capital requirements. Consistent with the Company's goals to operate a sound and profitable organization, its policy is for the Bank to maintain a well-capitalized status under the regulatory capital categories of the Federal Reserve. The Bank was categorized as "well-capitalized" at September 30, 2024 under applicable regulatory requirements. 
 HomeTrust Bancshares, Inc.'s and the Bank's actual and required minimum capital amounts and ratios are as follows:

 As permitted by the interim final rule issued on March 27, 2020 by the federal banking regulatory agencies, the Company elected the option to delay the estimated impact on regulatory capital of ASU 2016-13, which was adopted on July 1, 2020. The initial adoption of ASU 2016-13 as well as 25 of the quarterly increases in the ACL subsequent to adoption (collectively the transition adjustments was delayed for two years. Starting July 1, 2022, the cumulative amount of the transition adjustments became fixed and will be phased out of the regulatory capital calculations evenly over a three-year period, with 75 recognized in year three, 50 recognized in year four, and 25 recognized in year five. After five years, the temporary regulatory capital benefits will be fully reversed. 
 In addition to the minimum CET1, Tier 1 and total risk-based capital ratios, both HomeTrust Bancshares, Inc. and the Bank have to maintain a capital conservation buffer consisting of additional CET1 capital of more than 2.50 above the required minimum levels in order to avoid limitations on paying dividends, engaging in share repurchases, and paying discretionary bonuses based on percentages of eligible retained income that could be utilized for such actions. As of September 30, 2024, the Company's and Bank's risk-based capital exceeded the required capital contribution buffer. 
 Dividends paid by HomeTrust Bank are limited, without regulatory approval, to current year earnings and earnings less dividends paid during the preceding two years. 
 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 There has not been any material change in the market risk disclosures contained in our 2023 Form 10-KT. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures : An evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Act")) as of September 30, 2024, was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of the Company's Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and several other members of the Company's senior management. The Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures in effect as of September 30, 2024, were effective in ensuring that the information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports it files or submits under the Act is: (i) accumulated and communicated to the Company's management (including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief 
 45 

Financial Officer) in a timely manner and (ii) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms. 
 The Company does not expect that its disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control procedure, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control procedure are met. Because of the inherent limitations in all control procedures, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls may be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by override of the control. The design of any control procedure also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control procedure, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. 
 Changes in Internal Controls : There have been no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

2 event which is not covered by the foregoing subsections but which the Board of Directors determines to affect control of the Company or the Bank and with respect to which the Board of Directors adopts a resolution that the event constitutes a Change in Control for purposes of this Agreement; provided that with respect to each of the events covered by clauses (1) through (4) above, the event must also be deemed to be either a change in the ownership of the Company or the Bank, a change in the effective control of the Company or the Bank or a change in the ownership of a substantial portion of the assets of the Company or the Bank within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code. (c) The term Code means the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or any successor code thereto. (d) The term Consolidated Subsidiaries means any subsidiary or subsidiaries of the Company (or its successors) that are part of the consolidated group of the Company (or its successors) for federal income tax reporting. (e) The term Date of Termination means the date upon which the Employee's employment with the Company and its Consolidated Subsidiaries ceases, as specified in a written notice of termination, provided that all references in this Agreement to a Date of Termination that results in the payment of severance shall mean the date of the Executive s involuntary Separation from Service. (f) The term Effective Date means the date first written above. (g) The term Health Insurance Benefits shall mean the following benefits to be provided pursuant to Section 3(a) of this Agreement to the Employee and their dependents who are covered by the Company or any of its Consolidated Subsidiaries at the time of the Employee s Involuntary Termination (each such person, including the Employee, a Covered Person and collectively the Covered Persons ): (i) the Company or the Bank shall pay 100 of the premiums for COBRA coverage for each such Covered Person until the earlier of (A) the expiration of the COBRA period or (B) the death of such person; or (ii) in the event that the continued participation of the Covered Person in any insurance plan as provided in clause (i) above is barred or would trigger the payment of an excise tax under Section 4980D of the Code, or during the COBRA Period any such insurance plan is discontinued, then the Company and the Bank shall at their election either (A) arrange to provide the Covered Person with alternative benefits substantially similar to those which the Covered Person was entitled to receive under such insurance plan immediately prior to the Date of Termination, provided that the alternative benefits do not trigger the payment of an excise tax under Section 4980D of the Code, or (B) in the event that the continuation of any insurance coverage as specified above would trigger the payment of an excise tax under Section 4980D of the Code or in the event such continued coverage is unable to be provided by the Company or the Bank, pay to the Employee within 30 days following the Date of Termination (or within 30 days following the discontinuation of the benefits if later) a lump sum cash amount equal to the projected cost to the Company and the Bank of providing continued coverage to the Covered Person until the expiration of the COBRA Period, with the projected cost to be based on the costs being incurred immediately prior to the Involuntary Termination (or the discontinuation of the benefits if later), as increased by 15 on each scheduled renewal date. Any insurance premiums payable by the Company or the Bank as specified above shall be payable at such times and in such amounts (except that the Company or 

3 the Bank shall also pay any employee portion of the premiums) as if the Employee was still an employee of the Company or its Consolidated Subsidiaries, subject to any increases in such amounts imposed by the insurance company or COBRA, and the amount of insurance premiums required to be paid by the Company or the Bank in any taxable year shall not affect the amount of insurance premiums required to be paid by the Company or the Bank in any other taxable year. (h) The term Involuntary Termination means a termination of the employment of the Employee (i) by the Company without their express written consent; or (ii) by the Employee by reason of a material diminution of or interference with their duties, titles, responsibilities or benefits, including any of the following actions unless consented to in writing by the Employee: (1) a requirement that the Employee be based at any place other than Asheville, North Carolina, or within 20 miles thereof, except for reasonable travel on Company or Bank business; (2) a material demotion of the Employee; or (3) a material reduction in the Employee s salary, other than prior to a Change in Control as part of an overall program applied uniformly and with equitable effect to all members of the senior management of the Company or the Bank; provided in each case that Involuntary Termination shall mean a cessation or reduction in the Employee s services for the Company and the Bank (and any other affiliated entities that are deemed to constitute a service recipient as defined in Treasury Regulation 1.409A- 1(h)(3)) that constitutes a Separation from Service as determined under Section 409A of the Code, taking into account all of the facts, circumstances, rules and presumptions set forth in Treasury Regulation 1.409A-1(h) and that also constitutes an involuntary Separation from Service under Treasury Regulation 1.409A-1(n). In addition, before the Employee terminates their employment pursuant to clauses (1) through (3) of the preceding sentence, the Employee must first provide written notice to the Company within ninety (90) days of the initial existence of the condition, describing the existence of such condition, and the Company shall thereafter have the right to remedy the condition within thirty (30) days following the date it received the written notice from the Employee. If the Company remedies the condition within such thirty (30) day cure period, then the Employee shall not have the right to terminate their employment as the result of such event. If the Company does not remedy the condition within such thirty (30) day cure period, then the Employee may terminate their employment as the result of such event at any time within sixty (60) days following the expiration of such cure period. All references in this Agreement to an Involuntary Termination that results in the payment of severance shall mean an involuntary Separation from Service under Treasury Regulation 1.409A-1(n). The term Involuntary Termination does not include Termination for Cause, termination of employment due to death or permanent disability, or suspension or temporary or permanent prohibition from participation in the conduct of the affairs of a depository institution under Section 8 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act. (i) The term Section 409A means Section 409A of the Code and the regulations and guidance of general applicability issued thereunder. (j) The terms Termination for Cause and Terminated for Cause mean any of the following: (i) the commission by the Employee of a willful act (including, without limitation, a dishonest or fraudulent act) or a grossly negligent act, or the willful or grossly negligent omission to act by the Employee, which is intended to cause, does cause or is 

4 reasonably likely to cause material harm to the Company or any of its Consolidated Subsidiaries (including harm to its business reputation); (ii) the indictment of the Employee for the commission or perpetration by the Employee of any felony or any crime involving dishonesty, moral turpitude or fraud; (iii) the material breach by the Employee of this Agreement; (iv) the receipt of any formal written notice that any regulatory agency having jurisdiction over the Company or the Bank intends to institute any formal regulatory action against the Employee, the Company or the Bank (provided that the Board determines in good faith, with the Employee abstaining from participating in the vote on the matter, that the subject matter of such action involves acts or omissions by the Employee); (v) the exhibition by the Employee of a standard of behavior within the scope of their employment that is materially disruptive to the orderly conduct of the business operations of the Company or any of its Consolidated Subsidiaries (including, without limitation, substance abuse or sexual misconduct) to a level which, in the Board s good faith and reasonable judgment, with the Employee abstaining from participating in the vote on the matter, is materially detrimental to the best interests of the Company or any of its Consolidated Subsidiaries; (vi) the failure of the Employee to devote their full business time and attention to their employment as provided under this Agreement; or (vii) the failure of the Employee to adhere to any policy or code of conduct of the Company or any of its Consolidated Subsidiaries which causes, or is reasonably likely to cause, material harm to the Company or any of its Consolidated Subsidiaries; provided that, if the Board of Directors determines in its good faith discretion that the breach, behavior or failure specified in clauses (iii), (v) or (vi) above is capable of being cured by the Employee, then Cause shall not be deemed to exist with respect to such matter if the Employee cures the breach, behavior or failure to the satisfaction of the Board of Directors within 10 days following written notice to the Employee of such breach, behavior or failure. No act or failure to act by the Employee shall be considered willful unless the Employee acted or failed to act with an absence of good faith and without a reasonable belief that their action or failure to act was in the best interest of the Company or the Bank. The Employee shall not be deemed to have been Terminated for Cause unless and until there shall have been delivered to the Employee a copy of a resolution, duly adopted by the affirmative vote of not less than a majority of the entire membership of the Board of Directors at a meeting of the Board duly called and held for such purpose (after reasonable notice to the Employee and an opportunity for the Employee to present their views on the matter to the Board either in person without counsel or in writing), stating that in the good faith opinion of the Board of Directors the Employee has engaged in conduct described in the preceding sentence and specifying the particulars thereof in detail. The opportunity of the Employee to be heard before the Board shall not affect the right of the Employee to arbitration as set forth in Section 13 of this Agreement. The Board reserves the right to suspend the Employee with pay pending the determination of Cause under this Section 1(j), as appropriate. 2. Term. The initial term of this Agreement shall be from the Effective Date until September 11, 2025, subject to earlier termination as provided herein. On September 11 each year, beginning September 11, 2024, the term shall be extended for a period of one year in addition to the then-remaining term, provided that the Company has not given notice to the Employee in writing at least 30 days prior to such annual anniversary date that the term of this Agreement shall not be extended further, and provided further that the Employee has not received an unsatisfactory performance review by either their manager, the Board of Directors or the board of directors of the Bank. 

5 3. Severance Benefits. (a) In the event of the Involuntary Termination of the Employee at the time of or within 12 months following a Change in Control, the Company or the Bank shall, subject to the Employee executing and not revoking a general release of claims pursuant to Section 3(b) below, (i) pay to the Employee a lump sum cash amount equal to two times the Employee s Cash Compensation, with such lump sum payment to be made within 30 days following the date the general release of claims is executed and the revocation period expires without the release being revoked, except as otherwise set forth in Section 3(b) below, and (ii) provide Health Insurance Benefits to each Covered Person. If the Employee is a Specified Employee (as defined in Section 409A) at the time of their Separation from Service, then payments under this Section 3(a) which are not covered by either the separation pay plan exemption or the short-term deferral exemption from Section 409A set forth in Treasury Regulations 1.409A-1(b)(9)(iii) and 1.409A-1(b)(4), respectively, and as such constitute deferred compensation under Section 409A, shall not be paid until the 185th day following the Employee s Separation from Service, or their earlier death (the Delayed Distribution Date ). Any payments deferred on account of the preceding sentence shall be accumulated without interest and paid with the first payment that is payable in accordance with the preceding sentence and Section 409A. To the extent permitted by Section 409A, amounts payable under this Section 3(a) which are considered deferred compensation shall be treated as payable after amounts which are not considered deferred compensation (i.e., which are considered payable on account of an involuntary Separation from Service as herein defined herein pursuant to a separation pay plan or pursuant to the short-term deferral exemption). (b) The obligations of the Company and the Bank to pay severance or provide benefits under Section 3(a) above is expressly conditioned upon the Employee executing a general release of claims within the time period set forth in the release to be provided to him by the Company and not revoking such release, with such general release to release any and all claims, charges and complaints which the Employee may have against the Company and its Consolidated Subsidiaries, as well as the directors, officers and employees of such entities, in connection with the Employee s employment with the Company and its Consolidated Subsidiaries and the termination of such employment. Notwithstanding any other provision contained in this Agreement, in the event the time period that the Employee has to consider the terms of such general release (including any revocation period under such release) commences in one calendar year and ends in the succeeding calendar year, then the payments shall not commence or be paid until the succeeding calendar year. (c) Certain Reduction of Payments by the Bank. (i) In the event that the aggregate payments or benefits to be provided to the Employee pursuant to this Agreement, together with other payments and benefits which the Employee has a right to receive from the Company or its Consolidated Subsidiaries or any their successors are deemed to be parachute payments as defined in Section 280G of the Code or any successor thereto (the Severance Benefits ), then the aggregate present value of amounts payable or distributable to or for the benefit of the Employee pursuant to this Agreement (such amounts payable or distributable pursuant to this Agreement are hereinafter referred to as 

6 Agreement Payments shall be reduced to the Reduced Amount. The Reduced Amount shall be an amount, not less than zero, expressed in present value which maximizes the aggregate present value of Agreement Payments without causing any Severance Benefits to be nondeductible by the Company because of Section 280G of the Code. For purposes of this Section 3(b), present value shall be determined in accordance with Section 280G(d)(4) of the Code. (ii) All determinations required to be made under this Section 3(b)) related to the application of Section 280G of the Code shall be made by the Company s independent auditors or by such other firm with recognized expertise as may be selected by the Company (such auditors or, if applicable, such other firm are hereinafter referred to as the Advisory Firm ). The Advisory Firm shall, within ten business days of the Date of Termination or at such earlier time as is requested by the Company, provide to both the Company and the Employee an opinion (and detailed supporting calculations) that the Company has substantial authority to deduct for purposes of Section 280G of the Code (before taking into account any amount not deductible under Section 162(m) of the Code) the full amount of the Agreement Payments to be paid and that the Employee has substantial authority not to report on their federal income tax return any excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code with respect to the Agreement Payments to be paid. Any such determination and opinion by the Advisory Firm shall be binding upon the Company and the Employee. If the Agreement Payments are required to be reduced to the Reduced Amount, then the cash severance payable pursuant to Section 3(a) of this Agreement shall be reduced first. The Company and the Employee shall cooperate fully with the Advisory Firm, including without limitation providing to the Advisory Firm all information and materials reasonably requested by it, in connection with the making of the determinations required under this Section 3(c). (iii) As a result of uncertainty in the application of Section 280G of the Code at the time of the initial determination by the Advisory Firm hereunder, it is possible that Agreement Payments will have been made by the Company which should not have been made Overpayment or that additional Agreement Payments will not have been made by the Company which should have been made Underpayment ), in each case, consistent with the calculations required to be made hereunder. In the event that the Advisory Firm, based upon the assertion by the Internal Revenue Service against the Employee of a deficiency which the Advisory Firm believes has a high probability of success, determines that an Overpayment has been made, any such Overpayment paid or distributed by the Company to or for the benefit of the Employee shall be repaid by the Employee to the Company together with interest at the applicable federal rate provided for in Section 1274 of the Code, with such repayment to be made within 60 days following the date the amount of the Overpayment has been communicated to the Employee. In the event that the Advisory Firm, based upon controlling precedent or other substantial authority, determines that an Underpayment has occurred, any such Underpayment shall be promptly paid by the Company to or for the benefit of the Employee together with interest at the applicable federal rate provided for in Section 1274 of the Code, with such payment to be made within 60 days following the date the amount of the Underpayment has been communicated to the Company. 

7 (iv) Any payments made to the Employee pursuant to this Agreement, or otherwise, are subject to and conditioned upon their compliance with 12 U.S.C. 1828(k) and any regulations promulgated thereunder. (d) Termination for Cause. In the event of Termination for Cause, the Company shall have no further obligation to the Employee under this Agreement after the Date of Termination. 4. Attorneys Fees. In the event of a dispute arising out of this Agreement, reasonable legal fees and related expenses incurred by the Employee resulting from such dispute shall be paid by the Company only if the Employee prevails in such dispute. 5. Non-Disclosure, Non-Competition and Non-Solicitation Provisions. (a) Non-Disclosure. The Employee acknowledges that he has acquired, and will continue to acquire while employed by the Company and/or performing services for the Consolidated Subsidiaries, special knowledge of the business, affairs, strategies and plans of the Company and the Consolidated Subsidiaries which has not been disclosed to the public and which constitutes confidential and proprietary business information owned by the Company and the Consolidated Subsidiaries, including but not limited to, information about the customers, customer lists, software, data, formulae, processes, inventions, trade secrets, marketing information and plans, and business strategies of the Company and the Consolidated Subsidiaries, and other information about the products and services offered or developed or planned to be offered or developed by the Company and/or the Consolidated Subsidiaries Confidential Information ). The Employee agrees that, without the prior written consent of the Company, he shall not, during the term of their employment or at any time thereafter, in any manner directly or indirectly disclose any Confidential Information to any person or entity other than the Company and the Consolidated Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Employee is requested or required (including but not limited to by oral questions, interrogatories, requests for information or documents in legal proceeding, subpoena, civil investigative demand or other similar process) to disclose any Confidential Information, the Employee shall provide the Company with prompt written notice of any such request or requirement so that the Company and/or a Consolidated Subsidiary may seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy and/or waive compliance with the provisions of this Section 5(a). If, in the absence of a protective order or other remedy or the receipt of a waiver from the Company, the Employee is nonetheless legally compelled to disclose Confidential Information to any tribunal or else stand liable for contempt or suffer other censure or penalty, the Employee may, without liability hereunder, disclose to such tribunal only that portion of the Confidential Information which is legally required to be disclosed, provided that the Employee exercise their best efforts to preserve the confidentiality of the Confidential Information, including without limitation by cooperating with the Company and/or a Consolidated Subsidiary to obtain an appropriate protective order or other reliable assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded the Confidential Information by such tribunal. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the parties hereto agree that nothing contained in this Agreement limits the Employee s ability to report information to or file a charge or complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System or any other federal, state or local governmental agency or commission that has jurisdiction over the Company or any Consolidated Subsidiary (the 

8 Government Agencies ). The Employee further understands that this Agreement does not limit their ability to communicate with any Government Agencies or otherwise participate in any investigation or proceeding that may be conducted by any Government Agency, including providing documents or other information, without notice to the Company and/or any Consolidated Subsidiary. This Agreement does not limit the Employee s right to receive an award for information provided to any Government Agencies. In addition, pursuant to the Defend Trade Secrets Act of 2016, the Employee understands that an individual may not be held criminally or civilly liable under any federal or state trade secret law for the disclosure of a trade secret that (i) is made (A) in confidence to a federal, state or local government official, either directly or indirectly, or to an attorney; and (B) solely for the purpose of reporting or investigating a suspected violation of law; or (ii) is made in a complaint or other document that is filed under seal in a lawsuit or other proceeding. Further, an individual who files a lawsuit for retaliation by an employer for reporting a suspected violation of law may disclose the employer's trade secrets to the attorney and use the trade secret information in the court proceeding if the individual (y) files any document containing the trade secret under seal; and (z) does not disclose the trade secret, except pursuant to court order. On the Date of Termination, the Employee shall promptly deliver to the Company all copies of documents or other records (including without limitation electronic records) containing any Confidential Information that is in their possession or under their control, and shall retain no written or electronic record of any Confidential Information. (b) Non-Competition. As partial consideration for the severance payments and benefits to be provided to the Employee pursuant to Section 3 of this Agreement, the Employee agrees that during the one-year period next following the Date of Termination (the Non- Competition Period ), the Employee shall not engage in, become interested in, directly or indirectly, as a sole proprietor, as a partner in a partnership, or as a shareholder in a corporation, or become associated with, in the capacity of employee, director, officer, principal, agent, consultant, trustee or in any other capacity whatsoever, any enterprise or entity with an office located within 50 miles of any office of the Company or any Consolidated Subsidiary during the Non-Competition Period, which proprietorship, partnership, corporation, enterprise or other entity is engaged in any line of business conducted by the Company or any banking subsidiary of the Company during the Non-Competition Period, including but not limited to entities which lend money and take deposits (in each case, a Competing Business ), provided, however, that this provision shall not prohibit the Employee from owning bonds, non-voting preferred stock or up to five percent (5 of the outstanding common stock of any Competing Business if such common stock is publicly traded. (c) Non-Solicitation. As partial consideration for the severance payments and benefits to be provided to the Employee pursuant to Section 3 of this Agreement, the Employee agrees that during the two-year period next following the Date of Termination, the Employee shall not directly or indirectly (i) solicit or induce, or cause others to solicit or induce, any employee of the Company or any Consolidated Subsidiary to leave the employment of such entities, or (ii) solicit (whether by mail, telephone, personal meeting or any other means, excluding general solicitations of the public that are not based in whole or in part on any list of customers of the Company or any Consolidated Subsidiary) any customer of the Company or any Consolidated Subsidiary to transact business with any Competing Business, or to reduce or refrain from doing any business with the Company or any Consolidated Subsidiary, or interfere 

9 with or damage (or attempt to interfere with or damage) any relationship between the Company or any Consolidated Subsidiary and any such customers. The provisions of this Section 5 shall survive any termination of the Employee s employment and any termination of this Agreement. 6. No Assignments. (a) This Agreement is personal to each of the parties hereto, and neither party may assign or delegate any of its rights or obligations hereunder without first obtaining the written consent of the other party; provided, however, that the Company shall require any successor or assign (whether direct or indirect, by purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise) by an assumption agreement in form and substance satisfactory to the Employee, to expressly assume and agree to perform this Agreement in the same manner and to the same extent that the Company would be required to perform it if no such succession or assignment had taken place. Failure of the Company to obtain such an assumption agreement prior to the effectiveness of any such succession or assignment shall be a breach of this Agreement and shall entitle the Employee to compensation and benefits from the Company in the same amount and on the same terms as provided for upon an Involuntary Termination under Section 3 hereof. For purposes of implementing the provisions of this Section 6(a), the date on which any such succession becomes effective shall be deemed the Date of Termination. (b) This Agreement and all rights of the Employee hereunder shall inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Employee s personal and legal representatives, executors, administrators, successors, heirs, distributees, devisees and legatees. 7. No Mitigation. The Employee shall not be required to mitigate the amount of any payment or benefit provided for in this Agreement by seeking other employment or otherwise, nor shall the amount of any payment or benefit provided for in this Agreement be reduced by any compensation earned by the Employee as the result of employment by another employer, by retirement benefits after the Date of Termination or otherwise. 8. Notice. For the purposes of this Agreement, notices and all other communications provided for in this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given when personally delivered or sent by certified mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid, to the Company at its principal office, to the attention of the Board of Directors with a copy to the Secretary of the Company, or, if to the Employee, to such home or other address as the Employee has most recently provided in writing to the Company. 9. Amendments. No amendments or additions to this Agreement shall be binding unless in writing and signed by both parties, except as herein otherwise provided. 10. Headings. The headings used in this Agreement are included solely for convenience and shall not affect, or be used in connection with, the interpretation of this Agreement. 

10 11. Severability. The provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed severable and the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the other provisions hereof. 12. Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of North Carolina. 13. Arbitration. Any dispute or controversy arising under or in connection with this Agreement (other than relating to the enforcement of the provisions of Section 5) shall be settled exclusively by arbitration before a single arbitrator in Asheville, North Carolina under the commercial arbitration rules of the American Arbitration Association (the AAA then in effect. Judgment may be entered on the arbitrator's award in any court having jurisdiction. The arbitrator shall be selected by the mutual agreement of the parties within ten (10) business days of the date when the parties shall first have the opportunity to select an arbitrator (the Selection Period provided, however, that if the parties fail to agree upon an arbitrator by the expiration of the Selection Period, each party shall, within five (5) business days after the expiration of the Selection Period, select an arbitrator from the list of arbitrators provided by the AAA and the two arbitrators so selected by each party, acting independently, shall, as soon as practicable and within thirty (30) days of both being selected, agree upon the selection of the arbitrator to arbitrate the controversy or claim. 14. Equitable and Other Judicial Relief. (a) It is the intention of the parties hereto that the provisions of this Agreement shall be enforced to the fullest extent permissible under all applicable laws and public policies, but that the unenforceability or the modification to conform with such laws or public policies of any provision hereof shall not render unenforceable or impair the remainder of this Agreement. The covenants in Section 5(b) with respect to the geographic area surrounding each office shall be deemed to be separate covenants with respect to each office, and should any court of competent jurisdiction conclude or find that this Agreement or any portion is not enforceable with respect to a particular office, such conclusion or finding shall in no way render invalid or unenforceable the covenants herein with respect to any other office. Accordingly, if any provision shall be determined to be invalid or unenforceable either in whole or in part, including without limitation the geographic scope or duration of such provision, the parties hereto agree that the court or authority making such determination shall have the power to reduce the scope or duration of such provision or to delete specific words or phrases as necessary (but only to the minimum extent necessary) to cause such provision or part to be valid and enforceable. If such court or authority does not have the legal authority to take the actions described in the preceding sentence, the parties agree to negotiate in good faith a modified provision that would, in so far as possible, reflect the original intent of this Agreement, including without limitation Section 5 hereof, without violating applicable law. (b) The Employee acknowledges that any breach of Section 5 will result in irreparable damage to the Company for which the Company will not have an adequate remedy at law, especially in light of the impossibility of ascertaining exact money damages. In addition to any other remedies and damages available to the Company, the Employee further acknowledges that the Company shall be entitled to seek a temporary restraining order as well as preliminary and permanent injunctive relief hereunder to enjoin any breach or threatened breach of Section 5 

11 of this Agreement, and the Employee hereby consents to any restraining order or injunction issued in favor of the Company by any court of competent jurisdiction, without prejudice to any other right or remedy to which the Company may be entitled. In addition, in the event of a breach of Section 5 of this Agreement by the Employee, the Employee acknowledges that in addition to or in lieu of the Company seeking injunctive relief, the Company may also seek a forfeiture of the cash severance payments paid or payable to the Employee pursuant to Section 3 of this Agreement with respect to the period of the breach in an amount equal to (i) the value ascribed to the non-competition or non-solicitation provision in Section 5 that was breached, multiplied by (ii) a fraction, the numerator of which is the period of time that the Employee was in breach of such provision and the denominator of which is the total duration of such provision in Section 5. Each of the remedies available to the Company in the event of a breach by the Employee shall be cumulative and not mutually exclusive. 15. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original and all of which together will constitute one and the same instrument. 16. Changes in Statutes or Regulations. If any statutory or regulatory provision referenced herein is subsequently changed or re-numbered, or is replaced by a separate provision, then the references in this Agreement to such statutory or regulatory provision shall be deemed to be a reference to such section as amended, re-numbered or replaced. 17. Entire Agreement. This Agreement embodies the entire agreement between the Company and the Employee with respect to the matters agreed to herein. All prior agreements between the Company and the Employee with respect to the matters agreed to herein, including the Prior Agreement, are hereby superseded and shall have no force or effect. 

12 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have executed this Agreement as of the day and year first written above. THIS AGREEMENT CONTAINS A BINDING ARBITRATION PROVISION WHICH MAY BE ENFORCED BY THE PARTIES.
