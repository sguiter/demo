and of retainage, respectively, and contract liabilities included and of retainage, respectively. Retainage on active contracts is classified as current regardless of the term of the contract and is generally collected within one year of the completion of a contract. We anticipate collecting approximately of our September 30, 2024 retainage during the next twelve months, and the balance thereafter. These assets and liabilities are reported on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet within Contract assets and Contract liabilities on a contract-by-contract basis at the end of each reporting period. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, contract assets decreased by compared to December 31, 2023, primarily due to lower unbilled revenue and a decrease in retainage. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, contract liabilities increased by compared to December 31, 2023, due to the timing of advance billings and work progression, partly offset by an increase in retainage. Revenue recognized for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 that was included in the contract liability balance on December 31, 2023 was and , respectively. Revenue recognized for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 that was included in the contract liability balance on December 31, 2022 was and , respectively.

 (1) The earn-out arrangement requires the Company to pay up to based upon PPG s achievement of certain cumulative EBITDA targets for a period ending on December 31, 2026. No payment shall be made if the cumulative EBITDA targets are not achieved. 
 Preliminary Purchase Price Allocation The aggregate purchase price noted above was allocated to the assets and liabilities acquired based upon their estimated fair values at the acquisition closing date, which were based, in part, upon a preliminary external appraisal and valuation of certain assets, including specifically identified intangible assets. The excess of the fair value of consideration over the preliminary estimated fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired totaling was recorded as goodwill. This goodwill represents the value of expected future earnings and cash flows, as well as the synergies created by the integration of the new business within our organization, including cross-selling opportunities to help strengthen our existing service offerings and expand our market position. The goodwill and intangibles related to the acquisition are not expected to be deductible for tax purposes.

 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the total consideration and purchase price allocation changed by , primarily due to the finalization of the working capital adjustment. The purchase price allocation above is subject to further change when additional information is obtained. We have not finalized our assessment of the fair values primarily for intangible assets and property and equipment. We intend to finalize the purchase price allocation as soon as practicable within the measurement period, but in no event later than one year following the closing date of the PPG Acquisition. Our final purchase price allocation may result in additional adjustments to various other assets and liabilities, including the residual amount allocated to goodwill during the measurement period.

 Variable Consideration 
 The Company has projects that it is in the process of negotiating, or awaiting final approval of, unapproved change orders and claims with its customers. The Company is proceeding with its contractual rights to recoup additional costs incurred from its customers based on completing work associated with change orders, including change orders with pending change order pricing, or claims related to significant changes in scope which resulted in substantial delays and additional costs in completing the work. Unapproved change order and claim information has been provided to the Company s customers and negotiations with the customers are ongoing. If additional progress with an acceptable resolution is not reached, legal action will be taken. Based upon the Company s review of the provisions of its contracts, specific costs incurred and other related evidence supporting the unapproved change orders and claims, together in some cases as necessary with the views of the Company s outside claim consultants, the Company concluded it was appropriate to include in project price amounts of and , at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, relating to unapproved change orders and claims. Provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are made in the period in which such losses are determined. 
 Contract Estimates 
 Accounting for long-term contracts and programs involves the use of various techniques to estimate total contract revenue and costs. For long-term contracts, the Company estimates the profit on a contract as the difference between the total estimated revenue and expected costs to complete a contract and recognizes such profit over the life of the contract. Contract estimates are based on various assumptions to project the outcome of future events that often span several years. These assumptions include labor productivity and availability, the complexity of the work to be performed, the cost and availability of materials and the performance of subcontractors. Changes in job performance, job conditions and estimated profitability, including those changes arising from contract penalty provisions and final contract settlements, may result in changes in revenue and are recognized in the period in which the changes are determined. Changes in contract estimates on performance obligations satisfied or partially satisfied in previous periods resulted in net revenue increases of and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and net revenue increases of and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively.

 Joint Ventures with a Noncontrolling Interest The Company accounts for unconsolidated joint ventures using a pro-rata basis in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and as a single line item Receivables from and equity in construction joint ventures in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. This method is a permissible modification of the equity method of accounting which is a common practice in the construction industry. 
 Current liabilities ) ) Receivables from and equity in construction joint ventures 
 Income before tax Sterling s noncontrolling interest: Revenues Income before tax 
 The caption Receivables from and equity in construction joint ventures includes undistributed earnings and receivables owed to the Company. Undistributed earnings are typically released to the joint venture partners after the customer accepts the project as completed and the warranty period, if any, has passed. 
 Other The use of joint ventures exposes us to a number of risks, including the risk that our partners may be unable or unwilling to provide their share of capital investment to fund the operations of the venture or complete their obligations to us, the venture, or ultimately, the customer. Differences in opinions or views among joint venture partners could also result in delayed decision-making or failure to agree on material issues, which could adversely affect the business and operations of the joint venture. In addition, agreement terms may subject us to joint and several liability for our venture partners, and the failure of our venture partners to perform their obligations could impose additional performance and financial obligations on us. The aforementioned factors could result in unanticipated costs to complete the projects, liquidated damages or contract disputes, including claims against our partners.

The obligations under the Credit Facility are secured by substantially all assets of the Company and the subsidiary guarantors, subject to certain permitted liens and interests of other parties. The Credit Facility will mature on April 2, 2026. 
 As specified in the Credit Agreement, the Term Loan Facility bears interest at either the base rate plus a margin, or at a one-, three- or six-month Term SOFR rate plus a margin, at the Company s election. At September 30, 2024, the Company

and an applicable margin of per annum, and had a weighted average interest rate of approximately per annum during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Scheduled principal payments on the Term Loan Facility are made quarterly and total approximately , and for the years ending 2024, 2025 and 2026, respectively. A final payment of all principal and interest then outstanding on the Term Loan Facility is due on April 2, 2026. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company made scheduled Term Loan Facility payments of and , respectively. 
 The Revolving Credit Facility bears interest at the same rate options as the Term Loan Facility. In addition to interest on debt borrowings, we are assessed quarterly commitment fees on the unutilized portion of the facility as well as letter of credit fees on outstanding instruments. At September 30, 2024, we had outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility. 
 Debt Issuance Costs The costs associated with the Credit Facility are reflected on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as a direct reduction from the related debt liability and amortized over the term of the facility. Amortization of debt issuance costs was and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, and was recorded as interest expense. 
 Compliance and Other The Credit Agreement contains various affirmative and negative covenants that may, subject to certain exceptions, restrict our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to, among other things, grant liens, incur additional indebtedness, make loans, advances or other investments, make non-ordinary course asset sales, declare or pay dividends or make other distributions with respect to equity interests, purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire or retire capital stock or other equity interests, or merge or consolidate with any other person, among various other things. In addition, the Company is required to maintain certain financial covenants. As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with all of our restrictive and financial covenants. The Company s debt is recorded at its carrying amount in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Based upon the current market rates for debt with similar credit risk and maturities, at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the fair value of our debt outstanding approximated the carrying value, as interest is based on Term SOFR plus an applicable margin.

OVERVIEW 
 General Sterling Infrastructure, Inc., Sterling, the Company, we, our or us operates through a variety of subsidiaries within three segments specializing in E-Infrastructure, Transportation and Building Solutions in the United States, primarily across the Southern, Northeastern, Mid-Atlantic and Rocky Mountain regions and the Pacific Islands. E-Infrastructure Solutions provides advanced, large-scale site development services for manufacturing, data centers, e-commerce distribution centers, warehousing, power generation and more. Transportation Solutions includes infrastructure and rehabilitation projects for highways, roads, bridges, airports, ports, rail and storm drainage systems. Building Solutions includes residential and commercial concrete foundations for single-family and multi-family homes, parking structures, elevated slabs, other concrete work and plumbing services for new single-family residential builds. From strategy to operations, we are committed to sustainability by operating responsibly to safeguard and improve society s quality of life. Caring for our people and our communities, our customers and our investors that is The Sterling Way. 
 
 MARKET OUTLOOK AND TRENDS 
 We see favorable opportunities for long-term growth across each of our business segments. We remain focused on our strategic objectives which include: 1) growth in our E-Infrastructure Solutions segment, with particular focus on large, high-value projects; 2) risk reduction through a continued shift in our Transportation Solutions business away from low-bid heavy highway work, toward alternative delivery and design-build projects; 3) continuing to grow market share and geographic presence in Building Solutions; and 4) improving our margins in each of our segments. 
 E-Infrastructure Solutions Our E-Infrastructure Solutions business is driven by our customers investments in the development of data centers, advanced manufacturing centers, e-commerce distribution centers and warehouses. We foresee significant growth opportunities tied to the implementation of multi-year capital deployment plans by customers in the data center, electric vehicle (EV), battery, solar, food and semiconductor manufacturing markets. In the data center market, we are benefiting from activity related to the development of multiphase hyperscale data centers, driven by demand related to Artificial Intelligence (AI) and other emerging technologies. Additionally, we have been awarded several large projects related to investments in EV and solar products. We anticipate continued strong demand from these and other technology sectors, supported by Federal government investment initiatives and incentives. While the majority of our end customers are demonstrating strong performance, in 2023 we experienced a decline in large e-commerce distribution center and small warehouse activity. We expect these markets will remain subdued through 2024. 
 Transportation Solutions Our Transportation Solutions business is primarily driven by federal, state and municipal funding. Federal funds, on average, provide 50 of annual State Department of Transportation capital outlays for highway and bridge projects. We benefit from a number of federal, state and local infrastructure investment programs. At the state and local level, the November 2020 elections saw strong support for transportation initiatives with the passage of many ballot measures that secured, and in some cases increased, funding. At the Federal level, the November 2021 Infrastructure Investments and Jobs Act IIJA includes approximately 643 billion in funding for transportation programs 432 billion for highways, 109 billion for transportation and 102 billion for rail), of which 284 billion is an increase over historic investment levels that will fund new transportation infrastructure. The IIJA also includes 25 billion of funding for airport modernization. As a result of the IIJA, we had an increase in bid activity and project awards which started in the third quarter of 2022 and continued through the third quarter of 2024. We expect this positive trend to continue for the foreseeable future. Aviation activity, which was slower to emerge following the passage of the IIJA, has begun to accelerate. 
 Building Solutions Our Building Solutions segment is comprised of our residential slab, residential plumbing, and commercial businesses. The segment is driven by new home starts in Dallas-Fort Worth, the segment s largest market, and continued expansion in the Houston and Phoenix markets. Building Solutions core customer base includes top national, regional and custom home builders. We believe the dynamics in our markets, including population growth and structural housing shortages, support growth opportunities over a multi-year period. In 2024, residential demand has been impacted by a slowdown in activity, particularly in the Dallas market. This lull in demand appears to be a function of prospective homebuyers taking a wait-and-see approach to potential additional interest rate cuts. We believe that activity will re-accelerate in 2025. For our commercial business, demand in the multi-family home market increased in the first three quarters of 2023 but slowed late in the year. We expect continued declines in this market in 2024. 
 BACKLOG 
 Our remaining performance obligations on our projects, as defined in ASC 606, do not differ from what we refer to as Backlog. Our Backlog represents the amount of revenues we expect to recognize in the future from our contract commitments on projects. The contracts in Backlog are typically completed in 6 to 36 months. Our unsigned awards Unsigned Awards are excluded from Backlog until the contract is executed by our customer. We refer to the combination of our Backlog and Unsigned Awards as Combined Backlog. Our book-to-burn ratio is determined by taking our additions to Backlog and 
 21 

dividing it by revenue for the applicable period. This metric allows management to monitor the Company s business development efforts to ensure we grow our Backlog and our business over time, and management believes that this measure is useful to investors for the same reason. 
 At September 30, 2024, our Backlog was 2.06 billion, as compared to 2.07 billion at December 31, 2023, with a book-to-burn ratio of 1.0X for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The Company s margin in Backlog has increased to 16.8 at September 30, 2024 from 15.2 at December 31, 2023, driven by a greater mix of E-Infrastructure Solutions backlog and an improved backlog margin mix within Transportation Solutions. 
 Unsigned Awards were 319.6 million at September 30, 2024 and 303.2 million at December 31, 2023. Combined Backlog totaled 2.37 billion at both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, with a book-to-burn ratio of 1.0X for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 Consolidated Results 
 Consolidated financial highlights for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 are as follows: 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, (In thousands) 2024 2023 2024 2023 Revenues 593,741 560,347 1,616,923 1,486,251 Gross profit 129,799 91,867 319,446 245,883 General and administrative expense (30,672) (25,237) (85,826) (72,592) Intangible asset amortization (4,280) (3,736) (12,857) (11,209) Acquisition related costs (72) (103) (209) (352) Other operating expense, net (7,283) (5,654) (18,203) (11,703) Operating income 87,492 57,137 202,351 150,027 Interest, net 1,305 (3,107) 335 (14,189) Income before income taxes and noncontrolling interests 88,797 54,030 202,686 135,838 Income tax expense (23,404) (13,891) (48,960) (35,429) Less: Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests 
 (4,072) (786) (9,478) (1,927) Net income attributable to Sterling common stockholders 61,321 39,353 144,248 98,482 Gross margin 21.9 16.4 19.8 16.5 
 Revenues Revenues were 593.7 million for the third quarter of 2024, an increase of 33.4 million, or 6.0 , compared to the third quarter of 2023. The increase was driven by a 34.3 million increase in Transportation Solutions and a 10.0 million increase in E-Infrastructure Solutions, partly offset by a 10.8 million decrease in Building Solutions. 
 Revenues were 1.62 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 130.7 million, or 8.8 , compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was driven by a 153.8 million increase in Transportation Solutions and a 7.1 million increase in Building Solutions, partly offset by a 30.2 million decrease in E-Infrastructure Solutions. 
 Gross profit and margin Gross profit was 129.8 million for the third quarter of 2024, an increase of 37.9 million, or 41.3 , compared to the third quarter of 2023. The Company s gross margin as a percentage of revenue increased to 21.9 in the third quarter of 2024, as compared to 16.4 in the third quarter of 2023. 
 Gross profit was 319.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 73.6 million, or 29.9 , compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The Company s gross margin as a percentage of revenue increased to 19.8 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 16.5 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increases were driven by the aforementioned higher volume, an improved project margin mix across all segments, and the inclusion of the Texas plumbing business acquired in late 2023. 
 22 

Contracts in progress that were not substantially complete totaled approximately 220 and 230 at September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. These contracts are of various sizes, of different expected profitability and in various stages of completion. The nearer a contract progresses toward completion, the more visibility the Company has in refining its estimate of total revenues (including incentives, delay penalties and change orders), costs and gross profit. Thus, gross profit as a percentage of revenues can increase or decrease from comparable and subsequent quarters due to variations among contracts and depending upon the stage of completion of contracts. 
 General and administrative expense General and administrative expenses were 30.7 million, or 5.2 of revenue, for the third quarter of 2024, compared to 25.2 million, or 4.5 of revenue, for the third quarter of 2023. General and administrative expenses were 85.8 million, or 5.3 of revenue, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 72.6 million, or 4.9 of revenue, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increases reflect incremental G A from the Texas plumbing business acquired in late 2023, growth, and inflation. The Company anticipates that general and administrative expense will be approximately 5 of revenue for the full year 2024. 
 Other operating expense, net Other operating expense, net, includes 50 of earnings related to members interest of our consolidated 50 owned subsidiary, earn-out and other miscellaneous operating income or expense. Members interest earnings are treated as an expense and increase the liability account. 
 The change in other operating expense, net, for the third quarter of 2024 was an increase of 1.6 million over the prior year third quarter. Members interest earnings increased by 0.6 million during the third quarter of 2024 to 6.3 million from 5.7 million in the third quarter of 2023 and earn-out expense increased to 1.0 million during the third quarter of 2024, compared to none in the third quarter of 2023. 
 The change in other operating expense, net, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was an increase of 6.5 million over the prior year nine months. Members interest earnings increased by 3.5 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 to 15.2 million from 11.7 million in the prior year nine months and earn-out expense increased to 3.0 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to none in the prior year nine months. 
 Interest, net Combined interest expense and income was net income of 1.3 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to net expense of 3.1 million for the third quarter of 2023, and net income of 0.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to net expense of 14.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreases in net expense were driven by higher interest income due to increased interest rates in 2024 on our growing cash balance. 
 Income taxes The effective income tax rate was 26.4 for the third quarter of 2024 and 24.2 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The rates varied from the statutory rate primarily as a result of non-deductible compensation, state income taxes and other permanent differences. The Company incurred a 0.1 million and 3.5 million tax rate benefit for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, for increased tax deductions related to stock compensation. The Company anticipates an effective income tax rate for the full year 2024 of approximately 24 . See Note 11 - Income Taxes for more information. 
 Segment Results 
 The Company s operations consist of three reportable segments: E-Infrastructure Solutions, Transportation Solutions and Building Solutions. We incur expenses at the corporate level that relate to our business as a whole. A portion of these expenses are allocated to our business segments by various methods, but primarily on the basis of usage. The unallocated remainder is reported in the Corporate G A Expense line, which is primarily comprised of corporate headquarters facility expense, the cost of the executive management team, and other expenses pertaining to certain centralized functions that benefit the entire Company but are not directly attributable to any specific business segment, such as corporate human resources, legal, governance, compliance and finance functions.

 E-Infrastructure Solutions 
 Revenues Revenues were 263.9 million for the third quarter of 2024, an increase of 10.0 million, or 3.9 , compared to the third quarter of 2023. The increase was primarily driven by higher volume from data centers, partly offset by the timing of advanced manufacturing projects and lower volume from warehouses and other small projects. 
 Revenues were 689.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 30.2 million, or 4.2 , compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily driven by the timing of advanced manufacturing projects, lower volume from warehouses and other small projects, and delays due to inclement weather in the first quarter, partly offset by higher volume from data centers. 
 Operating income Operating income was 68.1 million, or 25.8 of revenue, for the third quarter of 2024, an increase of 32.1 million, compared to 35.9 million, or 14.2 of revenue, for the third quarter of 2023. Operating income was 146.9 million, or 21.3 of revenue, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 43.5 million, compared to 103.4 million, or 14.4 of revenue, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increases in operating income and margin were driven by a mix shift toward large mission-critical projects, partly offset by lower volume from warehouses and other small commercial projects and by the timing of advanced manufacturing projects. 
 Transportation Solutions 
 Revenues Revenues were 227.3 million for the third quarter of 2024, an increase of 34.3 million, or 17.7 , compared to the third quarter of 2023, and revenues were 609.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 153.8 million, or 33.8 , compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increases were driven by higher heavy highway, aviation and other non-highway services revenue. 
 Operating Income Operating income was 18.6 million, or 8.2 of revenue, for the third quarter of 2024, an increase of 4.1 million, compared to 14.5 million, or 7.5 of revenue, for the third quarter of 2023. Operating income was 42.2 million, or 6.9 of revenue, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 12.5 million, compared to 29.6 million, or 6.5 of revenue, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increases in operating income and margin were driven by an improved project margin mix and the aforementioned higher revenue. 
 Building Solutions 
 Revenues Revenues were 102.6 million for the third quarter of 2024, a decrease of 10.8 million, or 9.5 , compared to the third quarter of 2023. The decrease was primarily driven by lower commercial volume and fewer residential slabs completed compared to the third quarter of 2023. Our residential concrete slab and plumbing businesses were impacted by a slowdown in the Dallas market in the quarter, as prospective homebuyers appear to be waiting on the sidelines in expectation of future interest rate reductions. The decrease was partly offset by the inclusion of 14.8 million from the Texas plumbing business acquired in late 2023. 
 Revenues were 318.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 7.1 million, or 2.3 , compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily driven by the inclusion of 47.7 million 
 24 

from the Texas plumbing business acquired in late 2023 and an increase in residential slabs completed in the Arizona market compared to 2023, partly offset by fewer residential slabs completed in the Texas markets compared to 2023. 
 Operating income Operating income was 11.2 million, or 11.0 of revenue, for the third quarter of 2024, a decrease of 1.6 million, compared to 12.8 million, or 11.3 of revenue, for the third quarter of 2023. The decreases in operating income and margin were driven by builders having a shortage of developed land in the quarter, partly offset by by the inclusion of the Texas plumbing business. 
 Operating income was 39.8 million, or 12.5 of revenue, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 4.8 million, compared to 35.0 million, or 11.3 of revenue, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increases in operating income and margin were driven by the inclusion of the Texas plumbing business and a mix shift towards residential, which has higher margins than commercial. 
 
 LIQUIDITY AND SOURCES OF CAPITAL 
 Cash and Cash Equivalents Total cash and cash equivalents at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 includes the following components: 
 (In thousands) September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Generally Available 486,034 362,884 Consolidated 50 Owned Subsidiaries 92,543 72,007 Construction Joint Ventures 69,550 36,672 Total cash and cash equivalents 
 648,127 471,563 
 The following table presents consolidated information about our cash flows: 
 (In thousands) Nine Months Ended September 30, Net cash provided by (used in): 2024 2023 Operating activities 322,835 331,215 Investing activities (62,302) (25,637) Financing activities (83,969) (81,445) Net change in cash and cash equivalents 176,564 224,133 
 Operating Activities During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash provided by operating activities was 322.8 million, compared to net cash provided by operating activities of 331.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Cash flows provided by operating activities were primarily driven by higher operating income and changes in our accounts receivable, net contracts in progress and accounts payable balances (collectively, Contract Capital ), as discussed below. 
 Changes in Contract Capital The change in operating assets and liabilities varies due to fluctuations in operating activities and investments in Contract Capital. The changes in components of Contract Capital during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were as follows: 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, (In thousands) 2024 2023 Contracts in progress, net 129,287 195,392 Accounts receivable (75,759) (63,685) Receivables from and equity in construction joint ventures 9,692 (471) Accounts payable 13,053 24,180 Change in Contract Capital, net 76,273 155,416 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the change in Contract Capital was 76.3 million, which was primarily driven by the E-Infrastructure Solutions segment due to the increased size and duration of its projects in progress. The Company s Contract Capital fluctuations are impacted by the mix of projects in Backlog, seasonality, the timing of new awards and related payments for work performed and the contract billings to the customer as projects are completed. Contract Capital is also impacted at period-end by the timing of accounts receivable collections and accounts payable payments for projects. 
 Investing Activities During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash used in investing activities was 62.3 million, compared to net cash used of 25.6 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The net cash used during 
 25 

this year was primarily driven by 65.3 million for purchases of capital equipment, partly offset by 7.8 million of cash proceeds from the sale of property and equipment. Capital equipment is acquired as needed to support changing levels of production activities and to replace retiring equipment. 
 Financing Activities During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash used in financing activities was 84.0 million, compared to net cash used of 81.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The financing cash outflow during this year was primarily driven by 50.6 million for the repurchase of common stock, 19.7 million of repayments on the Term Loan Facility, and 13.4 million for withholding taxes paid on the net share settlement of vested equity awards. 
 Capital Strategy The Company will continue to explore additional revenue growth and capital alternatives to improve leverage and strengthen its financial position in order to take advantage of trends in the civil infrastructure and E-infrastructure markets. The Company expects to pursue strategic uses of its cash, such as, investing in projects or businesses that meet its gross margin targets and overall profitability, managing its debt balances and repurchasing shares of its common stock. 
 
 JOINT VENTURES 
 We participate in various construction joint venture partnerships in order to share expertise, risk and resources for certain highly complex projects. The joint venture s contract with the project owner typically requires joint and several liability among the joint venture partners. Although our agreements with our joint venture partners provide that each party will assume and fund its share of any losses resulting from a project, if one of our partners was unable to pay its share, we would be fully liable for such share under our contract with the project owner. Circumstances that could lead to a loss under these guarantee arrangements include a partner s inability to contribute additional funds to the venture in the event that the project incurred a loss or additional costs that we could incur should the partner fail to provide the services and resources toward project completion to which it committed in the joint venture agreement. See the 2023 Form 10-K under Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors. 
 At September 30, 2024, there was approximately 174 million of construction work to be completed on unconsolidated construction joint venture contracts, of which approximately 85 million represented our proportionate share. Due to the joint and several liability under our joint venture arrangements, if one of our joint venture partners fails to perform, we and the remaining joint venture partners would be responsible for completion of the outstanding work. As of September 30, 2024, we are not aware of any situation that would require us to fulfill responsibilities of our joint venture partners pursuant to the joint and several liability under our contracts.

 There have been no material changes to the Company s discussion of critical accounting estimates from those described in Item 7 of our 2023 Form 10-K. 
 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 Our interest rate risk relates primarily to fluctuations in variable interest rates on our revolving credit facility and term loan facility (collectively, the Credit Facility and our cash and cash equivalents balance. Our indebtedness as of September 30, 2024 included 323.8 million of variable rate debt under our Credit Facility. At September 30, 2024 a 100-basis point (or 1 increase or decrease in the interest rate would increase or decrease interest expense by approximately 3.2 million per year. As of September 30, 2024, we held cash and cash equivalents of 648.1 million. At September 30, 2024 a 100-basis point (or 1 increase or decrease in the interest rate would increase or decrease interest income by approximately 6.5 million per year. 
 Other 
 Fair Value The carrying values of the Company s cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable approximate their fair values because of the short-term nature of these instruments. Based upon the current market rates for debt with similar credit risk and maturities, at September 30, 2024, the fair value of our debt outstanding approximated the carrying value, as interest is based on Term SOFR plus an applicable margin. 
 Inflation While inflation did not have a material impact on our financial results for many years, since 2021, supply chain volatility and inflation has resulted in price increases in oil, fuel, lumber, concrete, steel and labor which have increased our 
 26 

cost of operations, and inflation has increased our general and administrative expense. Anticipated cost increases are considered in our bids to customers; however, inflation has had, and may continue to have, a negative impact on the Company s financial results. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Disclosure controls and procedures include, but are not limited to, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is accumulated and communicated to the issuer s management, including the principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 The Company s principal executive officer and principal financial officer reviewed and evaluated the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) as of September 30, 2024. As previously disclosed, we completed the PPG business acquisition on November 16, 2023 and, as permitted by SEC guidance for newly acquired businesses, we have elected to exclude the acquired business operations of PPG from the scope of design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures for the quarter ended September 30, 2024. Based on that evaluation, the Company s principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective at September 30, 2024 to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by the Company in this Report is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms and is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management including the principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls 
 Internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness of internal control to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
