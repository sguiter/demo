units (the Units and, with respect to the shares of Class
A ordinary shares included in the Units being offered, the Public Shares ), which includes the full exercise by the underwriters
of their over-allotment option in the amount of Units, at per Unit, generating gross proceeds of , which
is described in Note 3. 

Simultaneously
with the closing of the Initial Public Offering, the Company consummated the sale of an aggregate of warrants (the Private
Placement Warrants at a price of per Private Placement Warrant, in a private placement to the Company s sponsor,
Launch Two Sponsor LLC (the Sponsor ), and Cantor Fitzgerald Co., the representative of the underwriters of the Initial
Public Offering, generating gross proceeds of , which is described in Note 4. 

Transaction
costs amounted to , consisting of of cash underwriting fee, of deferred underwriting fee and 
of other offering costs. 

The
Company s management has broad discretion with respect to the specific application of the net proceeds of the Initial Public Offering
and the Private Placement Warrants, although substantially all of the net proceeds are intended to be generally applied toward consummating
a Business Combination (less deferred underwriting commissions). 

The
Company s Business Combination must be with one or more target businesses that together have a fair market value equal to at least
 of the net balance in the Trust Account (as defined below) (excluding the amount of deferred underwriting discounts held and taxes
payable on the income earned on the Trust Account) at the time of the signing an agreement to enter into a Business Combination. However,
the Company will only complete a Business Combination if the post-Business Combination company owns or acquires or more of the outstanding
voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register
as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the Investment Company Act ). There
is no assurance that the Company will be able to successfully effect a Business Combination. 

Following
the closing of the Initial Public Offering, on October 9, 2024, an amount of per Unit) from the net proceeds of
the sale of the Units and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants was placed in the trust account (the Trust Account ),
with Continental Stock Transfer Trust Company acting as trustee, and will be invested only in U.S. government treasury obligations
with a maturity of 185 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment
Company Act which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations; the holding of these assets in this form is intended
to be temporary and for the sole purpose of facilitating the intended Business Combination. To mitigate the risk that the Company might
be deemed to be an investment company for purposes of the Investment Company Act, which risk increases the longer that the Company holds
investments in the Trust Account, the Company may, at any time (based on the management team s ongoing assessment of all factors
related to the Company s potential status under the Investment Company Act), instruct the trustee to liquidate the investments
held in the Trust Account and instead to hold the funds in the Trust Account in cash or in an interest bearing demand deposit account
at a bank. Except with respect to interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account that may be released to the Company to pay its
taxes, if any, the proceeds from the Initial Public Offering and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants will not be released from
the Trust Account until the earliest of (i) the completion of the Company s initial Business Combination, (ii) the redemption
of the Company s public shares if the Company is unable to complete the initial Business Combination within 24 months from
the closing of the Initial Public Offering or by such earlier liquidation date as the Company s board of directors may approve
(the Completion Window ), subject to applicable law, or (iii) the redemption of the Company s public shares properly
submitted in connection with a shareholder vote to amend the Company s amended and restated memorandum and articles of association
to (A) modify the substance or timing of the Company s obligation to allow redemption in connection with the initial Business
Combination or to redeem of the Company s public shares if the Company has not consummated an initial Business Combination
within the Completion Window or (B) with respect to any other material provisions relating to shareholders rights or pre-initial
Business Combination activity. The proceeds deposited in the Trust Account could become subject to the claims of the Company s
creditors, if any, which could have priority over the claims of the Company s public shareholders.

per public share. 

The
ordinary shares subject to redemption were recorded at a redemption value and classified as temporary equity at the completion of the
Initial Public Offering, in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Accounting Standards Codification ASC Topic 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity. 

The
Company will have only the duration of the Completion Window to complete the initial Business Combination. However, if the Company is
unable to complete its initial Business Combination within the Completion Window, the Company will as promptly as reasonably possible
but not more than ten business days after the Completion Window, redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in
cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account
(less taxes payable and up to of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares,
which redemption will constitute full and complete payment for the public shares and completely extinguish public shareholders 
rights as shareholders (including the right to receive further liquidation or other distributions, if any), subject to the Company s
obligations under Cayman Islands law to provide for claims of creditors and subject to the other requirements of applicable law. 

The
Sponsor, officers and directors have entered into a letter agreement with the Company, pursuant to which they have agreed to (i) waive
their redemption rights with respect to their founder shares and public shares in connection with the completion of the initial Business
Combination; (ii) waive their redemption rights with respect to their founder shares and public shares in connection with a shareholder
vote to approve an amendment to the Company s amended and restated memorandum and articles of association; (iii) waive their
rights to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to their founder shares if the Company fails to complete the
initial Business Combination within the Completion Window, although they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the Trust
Account with respect to any public shares they hold if the Company fails to complete the initial Business Combination within the Completion
Window and to liquidating distributions from assets outside the Trust Account; and (iv) vote any founder shares held by them and
any public shares purchased during or after the Initial Public Offering (including in open market and privately negotiated transactions,
aside from shares they may purchase in compliance with the requirements of Rule 14e-5 under the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), which would not be voted in favor of approving the Business Combination) in favor
of the initial Business Combination. 

The
Company s Sponsor has agreed that it will be liable to the Company if and to the extent any claims by a third party for services
rendered or products sold to the Company, or a prospective target business with which the Company has entered into a written letter of
intent, confidentiality or other similar agreement or Business Combination agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the Trust Account
to below the lesser of (i) per public share and (ii) the actual amount per public share held in the Trust Account as
of the date of the liquidation of the Trust Account, if less than per share due to reductions in the value of the trust assets,
less taxes payable, provided that such liability will not apply to any claims by a third party or prospective target business who executed
a waiver of any and all rights to the monies held in the Trust Account (whether or not such waiver is enforceable) nor will it apply
to any claims under the Company s indemnity of the underwriters of the Initial Public Offering against certain liabilities, including
liabilities under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ). However, the Company has not asked
the Sponsor to reserve for such indemnification obligations, nor has the Company independently verified whether the Sponsor has sufficient
funds to satisfy its indemnity obligations and the Company believes that the Sponsor s only assets are securities of the Company.
Therefore, the Company cannot assure that the Sponsor would be able to satisfy those obligations.

30, 2024, the Company did not have any dilutive securities and other contracts that could, potentially, be exercised or converted into
ordinary shares and then share in the earnings of the Company. As a result, diluted net loss per ordinary share is the same as basic
net loss per ordinary share for the periods presented. 

Units, which includes the full exercise by the underwriters
of their over-allotment option in the amount of Units, at a purchase price of per Unit. . Each whole warrant entitles the holder to purchase Class A ordinary share
at a price of per share, subject to adjustment. Each warrant will become exercisable days after the completion of the initial
Business Combination and will expire after the completion of the initial Business Combination, or earlier upon redemption
or liquidation. 

Warrants 

As
of September 30, 2024, there were no warrants outstanding. Each whole warrant entitles the holder to purchase one Class A ordinary
share at a price of per share, subject to adjustment as discussed herein. The warrants cannot be exercised until 
after the completion of the initial Business Combination, and will expire at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, five years
after the completion of the initial Business Combination or earlier upon redemption or liquidation. 

The Company will not be obligated to deliver any Class A ordinary shares pursuant to the exercise of a warrant and will have no obligation
to settle such warrant exercise unless a registration statement under the Securities Act with respect to the Class A ordinary shares issuable
upon exercise of the warrants is then effective and a prospectus relating thereto is current. No warrant will be exercisable and the Company
will not be obligated to issue a Class A ordinary share upon exercise of a warrant unless the Class A ordinary share issuable upon such
warrant exercise has been registered, qualified or deemed to be exempt under the securities laws of the state of residence of the registered
holder of the warrants. In the event that the conditions in the two immediately preceding sentences are not satisfied with respect to
a warrant, the holder of such warrant will not be entitled to exercise such warrant and such warrant may have no value and expire worthless.
In no event will the Company be required to net cash settle any warrant. In the event that a registration statement is not effective for
the exercised warrants, the purchaser of a unit containing such warrant will have paid the full purchase price for the unit solely for
the Class A ordinary share underlying such unit.

business days
after the closing of its Business Combination, it will use commercially reasonable efforts to file with the SEC a post-effective amendment
to the registration statement for the Initial Public Offering or a new registration statement covering the registration under the Securities
Act of the Class A ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants and thereafter will use its commercially reasonable
efforts to cause the same to become effective within business days following the Company s initial business combination
and to maintain a current prospectus relating to the Class A ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants until the expiration
of the warrants in accordance with the provisions of the warrant agreement. If a registration statement covering the Class A ordinary
shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants is not effective by the sixtieth (60th) business day after the closing of the initial
Business Combination, warrant holders may, until such time as there is an effective registration statement and during any period when
the Company will have failed to maintain an effective registration statement, exercise warrants on a cashless basis in
accordance with Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act or another exemption. Notwithstanding the above, if the Class A
ordinary shares are at the time of any exercise of a warrant not listed on a national securities exchange such that they satisfy the
definition of a covered security under Section 18(b)(1) of the Securities Act, the Company may, at its option,
require holders of public warrants who exercise their warrants to do so on a cashless basis in accordance with Section 3(a)(9) of
the Securities Act and, in the event the Company so elects, the Company will not be required to file or maintain in effect a registration
statement, and in the event the Company does not so elect, the Company will use its commercially reasonable efforts to register or qualify
the shares under applicable blue sky laws to the extent an exemption is not available. 

If the holders exercise their public warrants on a cashless basis, they would pay the warrant exercise price by surrendering the warrants
for that number of Class A ordinary shares equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (x) the product of the number of Class A ordinary
shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants, multiplied by the excess of the fair market value of the Class A ordinary
shares over the exercise price of the warrants by (y) the fair market value. The fair market value is the average reported
closing price of the Class A ordinary shares for the 10 trading days ending on the third trading day prior to the date on which the notice
of exercise is received by the warrant agent or on which the notice of redemption is sent to the holders of warrants, as applicable. 

Redemption
of Warrants When the Price per Class A Ordinary Share Equals or Exceeds : The Company may redeem
the outstanding warrants: 

Once
the warrants become exercisable, the Company may redeem the Public Warrants: 

in
 whole and not in part; 

at a price of per warrant; 

upon a minimum of prior written notice of redemption (the 30-day redemption period and 

if, and only if, the closing price of the Class A ordinary shares equals or exceeds per share (as adjusted for adjustments to the number of shares issuable upon exercise or the exercise price of a warrant) for any trading days within a -trading day period commencing at least 30 days after completion of the Company s initial business combination and ending three business days before the Company sends the notice of redemption to the warrant holders. 

Additionally,
if the number of outstanding Class A ordinary shares is increased by a share capitalization payable in Class A ordinary shares,
or by a subdivision of ordinary shares or other similar event, then, on the effective date of such share capitalization, subdivision or
similar event, the number of Class A ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of each warrant will be increased in proportion to such
increase in the outstanding ordinary shares. A rights offering made to all or substantially all holders of ordinary shares entitling
holders to purchase Class A ordinary shares at a price less than the fair market value will be deemed a share capitalization of
a number of Class A ordinary shares equal to the product of (i) the number of Class A ordinary shares actually sold in
such rights offering (or issuable under any other equity securities sold in such rights offering that are convertible into or exercisable
for Class A ordinary shares) and (ii) the quotient of (x) the price per Class A ordinary share paid in such rights
offering and (y) the fair market value. For these purposes (i) if the rights offering is for securities convertible into or
exercisable for Class A ordinary shares, in determining the price payable for Class A ordinary shares, there will be taken
into account any consideration received for such rights, as well as any additional amount payable upon exercise or conversion and (ii) fair

the Working Capital Loans but no proceeds from the Trust Account would be used to repay the Working Capital Loans. Up to of
such Working Capital Loans may be convertible into private placement warrants of the post Business Combination entity at a price of per

Cautionary
Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements 

This
Quarterly Report includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended (the Securities Act ), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act, as amended (the Exchange Act ),
that are not historical facts and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expected

Company s final prospectus for its Initial Public Offering filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC ).
The Company s securities filings can be accessed on the EDGAR section of the SEC s website at www.sec.gov. Except as expressly
required by applicable securities law, the Company disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements
whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. 

Overview 

We
are a blank check company incorporated as a Cayman Islands exempted company on May 13, 2024, formed for the purpose of effecting a merger,
amalgamation, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses
or entities (the Business Combination ). We intend to effectuate our Business Combination using cash derived from the proceeds
of the Initial Public Offering and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants, our shares, debt or a combination of cash, shares and
debt. 

We
expect to continue to incur significant costs in the pursuit of our acquisition plans. We cannot assure you that our plans to complete
a Business Combination will be successful. 

On
January 24, 2024, the SEC adopted new rules and regulations for special-purpose acquisition companies SPACs ), which became
effective on July 1, 2024 (the 2024 SPAC Rules ). The 2024 SPAC Rules require, among other matters, (i) additional disclosures
relating to SPAC Business Combination transactions (ii) additional disclosures relating to dilution and to conflicts of interest
involving sponsors and their affiliates in both SPAC initial public offerings and Business Combination transactions; (iii) additional
disclosures regarding projections included in SEC filings in connection with proposed Business Combination transactions and (iv)
the requirement that both the SPAC and its target company be co-registrants for Business Combination registration statements. In addition,
the SEC s adopting release provided guidance describing circumstances in which a SPAC could become subject to regulation under
the Investment Company Act, including its duration, asset composition, business purpose, and the activities of the SPAC and its management
team in furtherance of such goals. The 2024 SPAC Rules may materially affect our ability to negotiate and complete our initial Business
Combination and may increase the costs and time related thereto. 

Results
of Operations 

We
have neither engaged in any operations nor generated any revenues to date. Our only activities from May 13, 2024 (inception) through
September 30, 2024 were organizational activities, those necessary to prepare for the Initial Public Offering, described below, and identifying
a target company for a Business Combination. We do not expect to generate any operating revenues until after the completion of our Business
Combination. Subsequent to the Initial Public Offering, we generate non-operating income in the form of interest income on marketable
securities held in the trust account (the Trust Account ). We incur expenses as a result of being a public company (for
legal, financial reporting, accounting and auditing compliance), as well as for due diligence expenses. 

16 

For
the three months ended September 30, 2024, we had net loss 16,084, which consisted of general and administrative costs. 

For
the period from May 13, 2024 (inception) through September 30, 2024, we had net loss 55,144, which consisted of general and administrative
costs. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

Until
the consummation of the Initial Public Offering, our only source of liquidity was an initial purchase of shares of Class B ordinary
shares, par value 0.0001 per share, by the Sponsor and loans from the Sponsor. 

Subsequent
to the quarterly period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, on October 9, 2024, we consummated the Initial Public Offering
of 23,000,000 Units at 10.00 per Unit, which includes the full exercise by the underwriters of their over-allotment option in the amount
of 3,000,000 Units, generating gross proceeds of 230,000,000. Simultaneously with the closing of the Initial Public Offering, we consummated
the sale of an aggregate of 7,075,000 Private Placement Warrants at a price of 1.00 per Private Placement Warrant, in a private placement
to the Sponsor and Cantor Fitzgerald Co., the representative of the underwriters of the Initial Public Offering, generating gross
proceeds of 7,075,000. 

We
intend to use substantially all of the funds held in the Trust Account, including any amounts representing interest earned on the Trust
Account (less income taxes payable), to complete our Business Combination. To the extent that our share capital or debt is used, in whole
or in part, as consideration to complete our Business Combination, the remaining proceeds held in the Trust Account will be used as working
capital to finance the operations of the target business or businesses, make other acquisitions and pursue our growth strategies. 

We
intend to use the funds held outside the Trust Account primarily to identify and evaluate target businesses, perform business due diligence
on prospective target businesses, travel to and from the offices, plants or similar locations of prospective target businesses or their
representatives or owners, review corporate documents and material agreements of prospective target businesses, and structure, negotiate
and complete a Business Combination. 

In
order to fund working capital deficiencies or finance transaction costs in connection with a Business Combination, the Sponsor or an
affiliate of the Sponsor or certain of our officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan us funds as may be required. If
we complete a Business Combination, we would repay such loaned amounts. In the event that a Business Combination does not close, we may
use a portion of the working capital held outside the Trust Account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our Trust Account
would be used for such repayment. Up to 1,500,000 of such Working Capital Loans may be convertible into private placement warrants of
the post Business Combination entity at a price of 1.00 per warrant at the option of the lender. The warrants would be identical to
the Private Placement Warrants. 

We
do not believe we will need to raise additional funds in order to meet the expenditures required for operating our business. However,
if our estimate of the costs of identifying a target business, undertaking in-depth due diligence and negotiating a Business Combination
are less than the actual amount necessary to do so, we may have insufficient funds available to operate our business prior to our Business
Combination. Moreover, we may need to obtain additional financing either to complete our Business Combination or because we become obligated
to redeem a significant number of our Public Shares upon consummation of our Business Combination, in which case we may issue additional
securities or incur debt in connection with such Business Combination. 

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements 

We
have no obligations, assets or liabilities which would be considered off-balance sheet arrangements as of September 30, 2024. We do not
participate in transactions that create relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, often referred to as variable
interest entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements. We have not entered
into any off-balance sheet financing arrangements, established any special purpose entities, guaranteed any debt or commitments of other
entities, or purchased any non-financial assets. 

Contractual
Obligations 

We
do not have any long-term debt, capital lease obligations, operating lease obligations or long-term liabilities, other than an agreement
to pay an aggregate of 12,500 per month for office space, utilities, and secretarial and administrative support. 

17 

The
underwriters were entitled to a cash underwriting discount of 4,000,000 (2.0 of the gross proceeds of the units offered in the Initial
Public Offering, excluding any proceeds from units sold pursuant to the underwriters over-allotment option), which was paid at
the closing of the Initial Public Offering. Additionally, the underwriters are entitled to a deferred underwriting discount of 4.50 
of the gross proceeds of the Initial Public Offering other than those sold pursuant to the underwriters over-allotment option,
and 6.50 of the gross proceeds sold pursuant to the underwriters over-allotment option, 10,950,000 in the aggregate payable
upon the completion of the Company s initial Business Combination subject to the terms of the underwriting agreement. 

Critical
Accounting Estimates 

The
preparation of condensed financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities,
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and income and expenses during the period reported.
Making estimates requires management to exercise significant judgement. It is at least reasonably possible that the estimate of the effect
of a condition, situation or set of circumstances that existed at the date of the financial statements, which management considered in
formulating its estimate, could change in the near term due to one or more future confirming events. Accordingly, the actual results
could materially differ from those estimates. As of September 30, 2024, we did not have any critical accounting estimates to be disclosed. 

Recent
Accounting Standards 

Management
does not believe that any recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting standards, if currently adopted, would have a material effect
on the Company s financial statements. 

Item
3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 

We
are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information otherwise
required under this item. 

Item
4. Controls and Procedures. 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures. 

Disclosure
controls and procedures are controls and other procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports
filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s
rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information
required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to Management, including
our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer (together, the Certifying Officers ), or persons performing similar
functions, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Under
the supervision and with the participation of our Management, including our Certifying Officers, we carried out an evaluation of the
effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under
the Exchange Act. Based on the foregoing, our Certifying Officers concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective
as of the end of the quarterly period ended September 30, 2024. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There
was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarterly period ended September 30, 2024 that
has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART
II - OTHER INFORMATION 

Item
1. Legal Proceedings. 

None. 

Item
1A. Risk Factors. 

Factors
that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those in this Quarterly Report include the risk factors described in our
final prospectus for the Initial Public Offering filed with the SEC. As of the date of this Quarterly Report, there have been no material
changes to the risk factors previously disclosed in our final prospectus filed with the SEC on October 8, 2024 in connection with the
Initial Public Offering. 

Item
2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds. 

On
May 13, 2024, the Sponsor subscribed for 5,750,000 founder shares for a total subscription price of 25,000 and fully paid for those shares.
The foregoing issuance was made pursuant to the exemption from registration contained in Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act. 

On
October 9, 2024, we consummated our Initial Public Offering of 23,000,000 Units, including 3,000,000 Units issued pursuant to the
full exercise of the underwriters of their over-allotment option. Each Unit consists of one Class A ordinary share, par value
 0.0001 per share Class A Ordinary Shares ), and one-half of one redeemable warrant of the Company Warrant ), with each whole Warrant entitling the holder thereof to purchase one Class A ordinary share for 11.50 per
share. The Units were sold at a price of 10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds to the Company of 230,000,000. 

Simultaneously
with the closing of the Initial Public Offering, pursuant to the Warrant Purchase Agreements, we completed the private sale of an aggregate
of 7,075,000 warrants to the Sponsor and the underwriters at a purchase price of 1.00 per Private Placement Warrant, generating gross
proceeds of 7,075,000. The Private Placement Warrants are identical to the Warrants included in the Units sold as part of the Units
in the Initial Public Offering, except as otherwise disclosed in the Registration Statement. No underwriting discounts or commissions
were paid with respect to such sale. The issuance of the Private Placement Warrants was made pursuant to the exemption from registration
contained in Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act. 

Of
the gross proceeds received from the Initial Public Offering and the proceeds of the sale of the Private Placement Warrants, an aggregate
of 231,150,000 was placed in the Trust Account. 

We
incurred a total of 15,615,485, consisting of 4,000,000 of cash underwriting fee, 10,950,000 of deferred underwriting fee, and 665,485
of other offering costs.
