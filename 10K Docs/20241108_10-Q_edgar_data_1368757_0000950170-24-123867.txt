 commercial properties (the Acquired Properties located in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, in exchange for of the outstanding limited partnership interest in the Operating Partnership. The outstanding limited partnership interest in the Operating Partnership exchanged for the Acquired Properties was increased to due to post-closing adjustments. The subsequent redemptions of certain shares of GTJ REIT common stock and purchases of a portion of the outstanding limited partnership interest have resulted in a net decrease to the outstanding limited partnership interest in the Operating Partnership to as of September 30, 2024. As a result of this transaction, the Company s then existing properties and the subsequent acquisition of properties and the sale of properties from 2014 through September 30, 2024, the Company currently owns a interest in a total of properties consisting of approximately million square feet (unaudited) of primarily industrial properties on approximately acres (unaudited) of land in New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Delaware and North Carolina. The Operating Partnership also owns, through a joint venture, a interest in a state-of-the-art industrial building in Piscataway, New Jersey. At September 30, 2024, subject to certain anti-dilutive and other provisions contained in the governing agreements, the limited partnership interest in the Operating Partnership may be converted in the aggregate, into approximately million shares of the Company s common stock or approximately million shares of the Company s Series B preferred stock based upon the class of units owned.

real estate under development as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Upon the acquisition of real estate properties, the accumulated cost of the real estate purchased is allocated to the acquired tangible assets (generally consisting of land, buildings and building improvements, and tenant improvements) and identified intangible assets and liabilities (generally consisting of above-market and below-market leases and the origination value of in-place leases) on a relative fair value basis in accordance with GAAP. The Company utilizes methods similar to those used by independent appraisers in estimating the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities. The fair value of the tangible assets of an acquired property considers the value of the property as-if-vacant. In allocating the purchase price to identified intangible assets and liabilities of an acquired property, the value of above-market and below-market leases is estimated based on the differences between contractual rentals and estimated market rents over the applicable lease term discounted back to the date of acquisition utilizing a discount rate adjusted for the credit risk associated with the respective tenants. Fixed-rate renewal options have been included in the calculation of the fair value of acquired leases where applicable. The value of in-place leases is based on the Company s evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenant s lease. The aggregate value of in-place leases is measured based upon factors which include the avoided costs associated with lack of revenue over a market-oriented lease-up period, current market conditions, avoided leasing commissions, and other avoided costs common in similar leasing transactions. Mortgage notes payable assumed in connection with acquisitions are recorded at their fair value using current market interest rates for similar debt at the time of acquisitions.

The following is a summary of terms and provisions of the Program:

stockholders can tender their Shares for redemption at any time during the period in which the Program is open; stockholders can also withdraw tendered Shares at any time prior to 10 days before the end of the applicable semi-annual period.

the number of redemptions receiving priority for death or disability will be limited to 1 million in shares per calendar year such that any stockholders requesting redemption upon death or disability will receive up to 1 million for shares per calendar year, and the remaining 1 million per calendar year will be available to redeem shares for the remainder of the Company s stockholders in the following order of priority: (1) any redemptions that have been carried over from one or more previous semi-annual periods where the redemption amount remaining is less than 2,500; and (2) pro rata as to all other redemption requests (excluding redemptions upon death or disability); provided, however, that if the redemption requests upon death or disability are less than 1 million in shares in a calendar year, then the amount under 1 million would also be available for the remainder of the Company s stockholders in accordance with the order of priority set forth in this sentence. 

the redemption price for the Shares will be paid in cash no later than 3 business days following the last calendar day of the applicable semi-annual period. 

the Program will be terminated if the Shares are listed on a national securities exchange or included for quotation in a national securities market, or in the event a secondary market for the Shares develops or if the Company merges with a listed company.

Revenues 
 Total revenues increased 0.6 million, or 3 , to 19.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 18.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase is primarily due to increased rental income attributable to higher rental rates in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023. 
 Operating Expenses 
 Operating expenses of approximately 9.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 0.5 million, or 5 , from 10.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to decreased property operating expenses in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023, partially offset by increased general and administrative expenses in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023. The decrease in property operating expenses is primarily attributable to lower repair and maintenance expenses in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023. The increase in general and administrative expenses is primarily attributable to higher stock compensation expense in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023. 
 Interest Expense 
 Interest expense of 6.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 0.4 million, or 6 , from 6.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase is primarily due to a higher average mortgage principal balance in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023.

Revenues 
 Total revenues increased 2.8 million, or 5 , to 58.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 56.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase is primarily due to increased rental income attributable to higher rental rates in 2024 compared to 2023. 
 Operating Expenses 
 Operating expenses of 35.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 4.6 million, or 15 , from 30.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to increased general and administrative expenses. The increase in general and administrative expenses is primarily attributable to higher executive compensation due to the achievement of certain Company financial goals, stock compensation and professional fees in 2024 compared to 2023. 
 Interest Expense 
 Interest expense of 20.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased approximately 1.9 million, or 10 , from 18.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase is primarily due to a higher average mortgage principal balance in 2024 compared to 2023. 
 Other Income 
 Other income of 1.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily attributable to interest income. 
 Other income of 1.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily attributable to a legal settlement with a former tenant and interest income. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 We derive substantially all of our revenues from rents received from tenants under existing leases on each of our properties. These revenues include fixed base rents and recoveries of certain property operating expenses that we have incurred and that we pass through to the individual tenants. 
 28 

Our primary cash disbursements consist of property operating expenses (which include real estate taxes, repairs and maintenance, insurance, and utilities), general and administrative expenses (which include compensation costs, office expenses, professional fees and other administrative expenses), leasing and acquisition costs (which include third-party costs paid to brokers and consultants), and principal payments and interest expense on our mortgage loans. 
 Our sources of liquidity and capital include cash flow from operations, cash and cash equivalents, borrowings under our revolving credit facility, refinancing existing mortgage loans, obtaining loans secured by our unencumbered properties, and property sales. 
 On December 2, 2015, the Company (through its Operating Partnership) entered into the Key Bank Credit Agreement with Key Bank for a 50.0 million revolving credit facility with an initial term of two years, with a one-year extension option, subject to certain other customary conditions. The Company, through the extension option and various amendments to the Key Bank Credit Agreement, extended the maturity date of the revolving credit facility to June 30, 2022. 
 On October 22, 2021, the Operating Partnership entered into a First Amended and Restated Credit Agreement with Key Bank and the other lenders parties thereto. The Amended and Restated Credit Agreement provided for a 60.0 million senior secured credit facility consisting of (i) a 10.0 million revolving line of credit facility, with an initial term of three years and two one-year extension options and (ii) a 50.0 million term loan facility, with an initial term of four years and a one-year extension option, which was funded in a single advance on October 22, 2021. Up to 10.0 million of the total commitments under the credit facility will be available for the issuance of letters of credit and swing line loans. 
 So long as no default or event of default has occurred and is continuing, the Operating Partnership shall have the right, from time to time, to request an increase in the size of the term loan, request an additional incremental term loan facility, or increase commitments under the revolving line of credit facility, collectively in an aggregate amount that would not cause the Credit Facility to exceed 125 million. 
 On August 5, 2022, the Operating Partnership entered into a First Amendment (the First Amendment to the First Amended and Restated Credit Agreement with Key Bank, as agent and lender, First Financial Bank, as lender, and the Company and certain direct and indirect subsidiaries of the Company as guarantors. The First Amendment amended the First Amended and Restated Credit Agreement to, among other things, (i) increase the amount available under the revolving line of credit facility from 10.0 million to 40.0 million, (ii) extend the maturity date of the revolving line of credit facility from October 22, 2024 to August 5, 2025, (iii) extend the maturity date of the term loan facility from October 22, 2025 to August 5, 2026, (iv) replace the interest rate option based on LIBOR with interest rate options based on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR ), including term SOFR and daily simple SOFR, and (v) add certain subsidiaries of the Operating Partnership as guarantors, and mortgages encumbering properties owned by such subsidiaries as collateral. As of August 5, 2022, outstanding borrowings under the revolving line of credit facility were 40.0 million. 
 On August 5, 2022, certain subsidiaries of the Operating Partnership refinanced the AIG Loan on certain properties by entering into new loan agreements (collectively the New AIG Loan Agreements with AIG Asset Management (U.S.), LLC, as administrative agent, and the other lenders from time to time party thereto. The New AIG Loan Agreements provide for secured loans in the aggregate principal amount of 225.0 million. 
 In addition, on March 15, 2024, certain subsidiaries of the Operating Partnership refinanced the outstanding debt of certain properties by entering into a new loan agreement (the "Loan Agreement") with American General Life Insurance Company. The Loan Agreement provides for a secured loan in the aggregate principal amount of 125.0 million. The Company used a portion of the proceeds to pay off 90.0 million of indebtedness that was outstanding under its senior secured credit facility with Key Bank, consisting of 40.0 million under the revolving line of credit facility and 50.0 million under the term loan facility. 
 Our available liquidity at September 30, 2024 was approximately 93.9 million, consisting of cash and cash equivalents and our available borrowing capacity under our revolving line of credit facility. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had no outstanding borrowings under the revolving line of credit facility.

 Investing Activities 
 Net cash used in investing activities was 2.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Cash used in investing activities resulted from (i) property improvements of 1.4 million and (ii) deposits for property acquisitions of 1.3 million. 
 Net cash used in investing activities was approximately 30.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Cash used in investing activities resulted from (i) the acquisition of one property for 29.0 million and (ii) property improvements of 1.7 million. 
 Financing Activities 
 Net cash provided by financing activities was 10.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Cash provided by financing activities resulted from (i) proceeds of mortgage loan payable of 125.0 million with American General Life Insurance Company, partially offset by (ii) the repayment of the Company's outstanding term loan payable of 50.0 million with Key Bank, (iii) the repayment of the Company's revolving line of credit facility with Key Bank of 40.0 million, (iv) the payment of mortgage principal of approximately 2.2 million, (v) the payment of the Company s fourth quarter 2023 dividend, 2023 supplemental dividend and 2024 dividends totaling 13.3 million, (vi) distributions to noncontrolling interests of 2.7 million, (vii) financing costs of 3.6 million for mortgage note payable with American General Life Insurance Company and (viii) repurchases of the Company's common stock of 2.7 million. 
 Net cash used in financing activities was 23.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Cash used in financing activities resulted from (i) the purchase of limited partnership interest in operating partnership of 32.2 million, (ii) the payment of mortgage principal of 1.3 million, (iii) the payment of the Company s fourth quarter 2022 dividend, 2022 supplemental dividend and 2023 quarterly dividends totaling 8.4 million, (iv) distributions to non-controlling interests of 3.9 million, (v) repurchases of the Company's common stock of 2.0 million and (vi) financing costs for mortgage note payable of 0.5 million relating to refinancing transaction with Transamerica Life Insurance Company, partially offset by (vii) proceeds of mortgage notes payable of 25.0 million from refinancing with Transamerica Life Insurance Company. 
 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 Funds from Operations and Adjusted Funds from Operations 
 We consider Funds from Operations FFO and Adjusted Funds from Operations AFFO ), each of which are non-GAAP measures, to be additional measures of an equity REIT s operating performance. We report FFO in addition to our net income and net cash provided by operating activities. Management has adopted the definition suggested by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts NAREIT and defines FFO to equal net income computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding gains or losses from sales of property, excluding impairment write-downs of depreciated property, plus real estate-related depreciation and amortization. We believe these measurements provide a more complete understanding of our performance when compared year over year and better reflect the impact on our operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs and general and administrative expense which may not be immediately apparent from net income. 
 30 

Management considers FFO a meaningful additional measure of operating performance because it primarily excludes the assumption that the value of our real estate assets diminishes predictably over time and industry analysts have accepted it as a performance measure. FFO is presented to assist investors in analyzing our performance. It is helpful because it excludes various items included in net income that are not indicative of operating performance, such as gains or losses from sales of property, impairment write-downs and depreciation and amortization. Management believes AFFO to be a meaningful, additional measure of operating performance because it provides information consistent with the Company s analysis of its operating performance by excluding non-cash and certain other income and expense items such as straight-lined rent, amortization of other intangible assets, mark to market debt adjustments, financing costs, our realized gain from an investment in a limited partnership, insurance recoveries related to casualty loss, gain or loss on extinguishment of debt, and stock compensation expense, which are not indicative of the results of our operating portfolio. 
 However, FFO and AFFO: 
 do not represent cash flows from operating activities in accordance with GAAP, which unlike FFO and AFFO, generally reflect all cash effects of transactions and other events in the determination of net income; 

are non-GAAP financial measures and do not represent net income as defined by GAAP; and 

should not be considered alternatives to net income as indications of our performance. 

FFO and AFFO as defined by us may not be comparable to similarly titled items reported by other real estate investment trusts due to possible differences in the application of the NAREIT definition used by such REITs. 
 The reconciliation of net income attributable to our common stockholders in accordance with GAAP to FFO and AFFO for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 is as follows (in thousands). All amounts are net of noncontrolling interest.

The Company believes FFO and AFFO to be the most appropriate supplemental disclosure of operating performance for a REIT due to its widespread acceptance and use within the REIT and analyst communities. FFO and AFFO provide a uniform supplemental basis for evaluating the earnings performance of REITs considering the unique capital structure of each REIT. 
 Cash Payments for Financing 
 Payments of interest under our mortgage notes payable will consume a portion of our cash flow, reducing net income and consequently, the distributions to be made to our stockholders. 
 Trend in Financial Resources 
 We expect to receive additional rent payments over time due to scheduled increases in rent set forth in the leases on our properties. It should be noted, however, that the additional rent payments are expected to result in an approximately equal obligation to make additional distributions to stockholders, and will therefore not result in a material increase in working capital. 
 31 

Inflation 
 Inflation has recently increased substantially in the United States. In response, the Federal Reserve increased interest rates throughout 2022 and 2023, and, although the Federal Reserve decreased interest rates in September, 2024 and has indicated that interest rates may continue to be decreased in 2024, further interest rate increases by the Federal Reserve are possible. Higher interest rates imposed by the Federal Reserve to address inflation may increase our interest expense on our variable rate borrowings. The Company did not have any variable rate borrowings outstanding as of September 30, 2024. In addition, increased inflation could have a negative impact on the Company s property operating expenses, as these costs could increase at a rate higher than the Company s rents. Our properties have tenants whose leases include expense reimbursements and other provisions to minimize the effect of inflation. However, rising costs could adversely affect our tenants businesses, and there is no guarantee our tenants would be able to absorb these expense increases and continue to pay us their portion of property operating expenses and rent. 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 Market risks that arise from changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and other market changes affect market sensitive instruments. In pursuing our business strategies, the primary market risk which we are exposed to is interest rate risk. On August 5, 2022, the Operating Partnership entered into a First Amendment to the First Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated October 22, 2021, with Key Bank and the other lenders parties thereto which provided for a 90 million senior secured credit facility (the Credit Facility ), consisting of (i) a 40 million revolving line of credit facility and (ii) a 50 million term loan facility. Loans drawn down by the Operating Partnership under the Credit Facility must specify, at the Operating Partnership s option, whether they are base rate loans, daily simple SOFR rate loans or term SOFR loans. Borrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest at a rate equal to, at the Operating Partnership s option, either (1) daily simple SOFR plus 0.1 (but in no case shall the rate be less than zero), (2) term SOFR plus 0.1 (but in no case shall the rate be less than zero) Adjusted Term SOFR ), or (3) a base rate determined by reference to the greatest of (a) the fluctuating annual rate of interest announced from time to time by Key Bank as its prime rate , (b) 0.50 above the federal funds effective rate, (c) Adjusted Term SOFR for a one month tenor plus 1.0 and (d) 1.0 , and in each case of clauses (1), (2) and (3), plus an applicable margin, depending upon the overall leverage of the properties and whether the loan is under the Revolver or Term Loan facilities. The Term Loan facility of 50 million and the outstanding balance of the Revolver of 40 million were both paid in full on March 15, 2024. Therefore, as of September 30, 2024, the Company's interest expense would not be affected by any changes in the SOFR interest rates. 
 I tem 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 We maintain a system of disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )). As required by Rule 15d-15(b) under the Exchange Act, management, under the direction of our Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, reviewed and performed an evaluation of the effectiveness of design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of September 30, 2024, the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that (i) information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and (ii) information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
