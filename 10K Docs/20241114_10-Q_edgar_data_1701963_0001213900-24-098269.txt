million. In addition, as of August 22, 2024, the Company did not meet
the alternative compliance standards relating to the market value of listed securities or net income from continuing operations. 

 In October 2024, the Company entered into a 
funding agreement with ASPIS Cyber Technologies ASPIS ). At that time, ASPIS delivered to the Company and agreed
to, on or before November 15, 2024, deliver to the Company an additional . However, the Company has informally agreed to defer

issued to ASPIS a senior convertible promissory note in the principal amount of the total amount funded. The note provides that upon approval
by the Company s shareholders and the Company s redomiciling to Delaware the amount funded to date plus, at ASPIS s

per month beginning in January 2025. The Company will retain ownership of Versus 
technology and ASPIS will hold an exclusive license to use Versus technology in the cybersecurity industry so long as ASPIS continues
to pay the monthly license fee. The License Agreement has an initial term of one year with successive renewal terms of one year each
upon ASPIS s written approval, subject to earlier termination by the Company or ASPIS. 

In October 2024, the Company warrant holders exercised
 warrants issued in December 2023 offering upon such exercise, the Company issued common shares at a price of per
share, for proceeds. 

Going Concern 

These condensed interim consolidated
financial statements have been prepared on the assumption that the Company will continue as a going concern, meaning it will continue
in operation for the foreseeable future and will be able to realize assets and discharge liabilities in the ordinary course of operations.
Different bases of measurement may be appropriate if the Company is not expected to continue operations for the foreseeable future. As
of September 30, 2024, the Company has not achieved positive cash flow from operations and is not able to finance day to day activities
through operations and as such, there is substantial doubt as to the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company s
continuation as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to attain profitable operations and generate funds therefrom and/or raise
equity capital or borrowings sufficient to meet current and future obligations. These condensed interim consolidated financial statements
do not include any adjustments as to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts and classification of liabilities
that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. These adjustments could be material. 

Management s plans include attempting to
secure additional required funding through equity or debt financing, if available, seeking to enter into a partnership or other strategic
agreement regarding, or sales or out-licensing of, its technology. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain required funding
in the future. If the Company does not obtain required funding, the Company s cash resources will be depleted in the near term
and the Company would be required to materially reduce or suspend operations, which would likely have a material adverse effect on the
Company s business, stock price and our relationships with third parties with whom the Company have business relationships. If the
Company does not have sufficient funds to continue operations, the Company could be required to seek bankruptcy protection, dissolution
or liquidation, or other alternatives that could result in the Company s stockholders losing some or all of their investment in
us. The Company has implemented expense reduction measures including, without limitation, employee headcount reductions and the reduction
or discontinuation of certain product development programs. Additionally, the Company is not in compliance with certain listing standards
of the Nasdaq National Market and there can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in curing the deficiencies and regaining
compliance by the applicable cure dates. (See Note 11 for additional information).

Item
2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

You
 should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results
 of operations for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, in addition to the Quarterly
 Report for the period ended March 31, 2024 and June 30, 2024, in conjunction with our unaudited
 condensed consolidated interim financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere
 in this Quarterly Report. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve
 risks and uncertainties. Our actual results and the timing of selected events could differ
 materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various
 factors, including those set forth under Risk Factors and elsewhere in this
 Quarterly Report. 

Overview 

We
offer a suite of proprietary business-to-business software tools that are meant to drive user engagement through gamification and rewards.
These tools allow our partners to offer in-game prizing and rewards, including merchandise, coupons, digital goods, and sweepstakes entries inside
their websites, their venues, or their streaming media content. 

Our
customers are mostly sports teams, venues, and advertising agencies, who typically use our products as part of their live events or as
part of an advertising campaign with the goal of engaging fans, increasing consented first-party data, and increasing sales. At December
31, 2023 and at September 30, 2024, we had five and one active customers due to the decrease in our sales force. 

Our
products and games are designed so that end users of our products can earn prizes by registering on our system and completing in-content
challenges like trivia, polls, or casual mobile games. Players can use our system to play a variety of games and earn a wide range of
prize types provided by advertisers and sponsors. Our products include our in-venue XEO and Filter Fan Cam products for live events,
and our new stand-alone Winfinite product that can be used by brands, advertising agencies, and content partners to reach
potential customers outside of sports venues, on mobile devices. We also have an IP portfolio that could create future licensing and
product development opportunities including our recently allowed Artificial Intelligence AI and Machine Learning ML series of patent claims. 

With
the acquisition of Xcite Interactive in June 2021, we acquired a number of key pieces of technology and relationships that have helped
to drive our engagement and rewards business, including a live events fan engagement business that has partnered with professional sports
franchises in the National Football League NFL ), the National Basketball Association NBA ), the National
Hockey League NHL and others to increase audience engagement using interactive gaming functions like trivia, polling,
and casual games that can be played alongside live experiences whether a player is at-home, in a restaurant, or in-venue at the event
itself. Our three largest customers in 2023 were the San Jose Sharks, the Sacramento Kings, and ENT Marketing, a marketing agency that
used our platform to promote Coca-Cola products. 

We
now have three principal software products. Our eXtreme Engagement Online or XEO platform is designed primarily for in-venue
main-board work in stadiums and arenas. Our Filter Fan Cam (FFC) platform is an Augmented Reality filtering tool that can be used for
mobile and in-venue applications. In addition, we have a stand-alone gaming and prizing product that we call Winfinite, 
which allows brands, media companies, and advertising agencies to reach out to customers directly on their mobile devices. We license
these three software products to teams, ad agencies, and other content creators.

Significant
Components of Our Results of Operations 

Revenue.
 In general, we recognize revenue when the amount of revenue can be reliably measured, it is probable that future economic benefits
will flow to us, where there is evidence of an arrangement, when the selling price is fixed or determinable, and when specific criteria
have been met or there are no significant remaining performance obligations for each of our activities as described below. Foreseeable
losses, if any, are recognized in the year or period in which the loss is determined. 

We
earn revenue through the development and maintenance of custom-built software. 

We
recognize revenues received from the development and maintenance of custom-built software and other professional services provided upon
the satisfaction of our performance obligation in an amount that reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled in exchange
for those services. Performance obligations can be satisfied either at a single point in time or over time. For those performance obligations
that are satisfied at a single point in time, the revenue is recognized at that time. For each performance obligation satisfied over
time, we recognize revenue by measuring the progress toward complete satisfaction of that performance obligation. 

Our
contracts with customers may include multiple performance obligations. For these contracts, we account for individual performance obligations
separately if they are capable of being distinct within the context of the contract. Determining which performance obligations are considered
distinct may require significant judgment. Judgment is also required to determine the amount of revenue associated with each distinct
performance obligation. 

Operating
Expenses. We classify our operating expense as research and development, and selling, general and administrative. Personnel costs
are the primary component of each of these operating expense categories, which consist of cash-based personnel costs, such as salaries,
benefits and bonuses. Additionally, these categories include intangible amortization, amortization expense, interest expense, software
costs, professional fees and share-based compensation.

Revenue 

Our revenues are derived
primarily from software licensing. Revenue was 3,848 for the three month period ended September 30, 2024, representing a decrease of
 19,102, or 83 , from 22,950 for the three month period ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to a significant reduction
in the number of clients from September 30, 2023 to September 30, 2024. 

Cost of revenues 

Cost of revenues was none
for the three month period ended September 30, 2024, representing a decrease of 23,570, or 100 , from 23,570 for the three month period
ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was in line with the decrease in revenue 

Research and development 

Research and development
was 11,462 for the three month period ended September 30, 2024, representing a decrease of 260,649, or 96 , from 272,111 for the three
month period ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to significant reductions in staff related to our company restructuring. 

Selling, general and administrative 

Selling, general and administrative
was 521,410 for the three month period ended September 30, 2024, representing a decrease of 1,095,751, or 68 , from 1,617,161 for the
three month period ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in payroll as the Company reduced head count
and a decrease in professional fees. 

Loss from Operations 

Loss from operations was 529,024 for the three month period ended
September 30, 2024, representing a decrease of 1,360,868, or 72 , from 1,889,892 for the three month period ended September 30, 2023.
The decrease was primarily the result of decreased spend on professional fees and payroll.

Revenue 

Our revenues are derived
primarily from software licensing. Revenue was 57,288 for the nine month period ended September 30, 2024, representing a decrease of
 179,665, or 76 , from 236,953 for the nine month period ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to a significant reduction
in the number of clients from September 30, 2023 to September 30, 2024. 

Cost of revenues 

Cost of revenues was 40,277
for the nine month period ended September 30, 2024, representing a decrease of 39,220, or 49 , from 79,497 for the nine month period
ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was in line with the decrease in revenue. 

Research and development 

Research and development
was 118,077 for the nine month period ended September 30, 2024, representing a decrease of 938,841, or 89 , from 1,056,918 for the
nine month period ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to a reduction in staffing levels, including a large portion
of our engineering staff, and a reduction in software costs. 

Selling, general and administrative 

Selling, general and administrative
was 3,429,062 for the nine month period ended September 30, 2024, representing a decrease of 1,044,648, or 23 , from 4,473,710 for
the nine month period ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in payroll as the Company reduced head count
and a decrease in professional fees. 

Loss from Operations 

Loss from operations was
 3,530,128 for the nine month period ended September 30, 2024, representing a decrease of 1,843,044, or 34 , from 5,373,172 for the
nine month period ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily the result of decreased spend on professional fees and payroll. 

Inflation 

The effect of inflation on
our revenue and operating results was not significant. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

We had cash of 471,248 and
a working capital surplus of 1,215,990 as at September 30, 2024, compared to a cash position of 4,689,007 and working capital surplus
of 4,546,227 as at December 31, 2023. The decrease in our cash position and decrease in working capital surplus was related to using
cash to fund operations and ongoing losses. 

Our financial condition and
liquidity is and will continue to be influenced by a variety of factors, including: 

our ability to generate cash flows from our operations; 

future indebtedness and the interest we are obligated to pay on this indebtedness; 

the availability of public and private debt and equity financing; 

changes in exchange rates which will impact our generation of cash flows from operations when measured in CAD; and 

our capital expenditure requirements. 

24 

Overview 

Since inception, we have incurred significant operating losses. For
the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, we incurred net losses of approximately 10.5 million and 22.4 million, respectively. For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024 the company incurred a net loss of 3.5 million. During such periods, we have financed our operations
primarily through an initial public offering of our common shares in January 2021 and subsequent public offerings, registered direct offerings,
and private placements. In February 2023, we completed a registered direct offering of our common shares in which we received gross proceeds
of 2.25 million and net proceeds of approximately 2 million. In October 2023, we completed a public direct offering of our common shares
in which we received gross proceeds of approximately 3 million and net proceeds of approximately 2.5 million. In November 2023, we completed
a private placement of our equity securities in which we received gross proceeds of 2.6 million. Throughout 2023, we received approximately
 4.6 million in proceeds from warrant exercises. Our cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2023 was 4.7 million. Our primary cash
needs are for working capital requirements, capital expenditures and to fund our operations. 

We are subject to the risks
and uncertainties associated with a new business. We believe that our current resources and the expected revenues from operations will
be insufficient to fund our planned operations for the next twelve months. The report of our independent registered public accounting
firm on our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023 stated that our recurring losses from operations, accumulated
deficit as of December 31, 2023, inability to achieve positive cash flows from operations and inability to fund day to day activities
through operations indicates that a material uncertainty exists that may cast significant doubt on our ability to continue as a going
concern. 

While we plan to increase
our cash flow from our operations to address some of our liquidity concerns, to date we have been unable to do so and are experiencing
declining revenues. Accordingly, we are evaluating other strategic alternatives. However, to execute our business plan and implement our
business strategy, we anticipate that we will need to obtain additional financing and may choose to raise additional funds through public
or private equity or debt financings, a bank line of credit, borrowings from affiliates or other arrangements. We cannot be sure that
any additional funding, if needed, will be available on terms favorable to us or at all. Furthermore, any additional capital raised through
the sale of equity or equity-linked securities may dilute our current shareholders ownership in us and could also result in a decrease
in the market price of our common shares. The terms of those securities issued by us in future capital transactions may be more favorable
to new investors and may include the issuance of warrants or other derivative securities, which may have a further dilutive effect. Furthermore,
any debt financing, if available, may subject us to restrictive covenants and significant interest costs. There can be no assurance that
we will be able to raise additional capital, when needed, to continue operations in their current form. If we cannot raise needed funds,
we might be forced to make substantial reductions in our operating expenses, including reductions in our research and development expenses
or headcount reductions, which could adversely affect our ability to implement our business plan and ultimately our viability as a company,
or we may be forced to liquidate the company. 

Cash Flows

the key components of our cash flows for the nine months period ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:

Operating Activities 

Net cash used in operating activities for the nine month period ended
September 30, 2024 was 4,255,345 as compared to 4,355,723 for the nine month period ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in cash used
in operating activities was primarily attributable to the change in our net loss of 1,436,364 offset by increase in non-cash stock compensation
offset by a decrease in amortization of intangible assets. 

Investing Activities 

Net cash used in investing
activities for the nine month period ended September 30, 2024 was none as compared to 14,106 for the nine month period ended September
30, 2023. The change in cash flow used in investing activities was primarily attributable to a significant reduction in payroll capitalized
for the development of intangible assets. 

Financing Activities 

Net cash provided by financing
activities was none for the nine month period ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 5,362,978 for the nine month period ended September
30, 2023. The change in cash flow provided by financing activities was mainly attributable to proceeds we received from the issuance
of common shares, net of issuance costs, exercise of warrants and options, which was offset by repayments on notes payable and lease
liabilities in 2023. 

Indebtedness 

Notes Payable 

From 2017 to December 31,
2022, we issued 4,750,818 aggregate principal amount of promissory notes primarily to Brian Tingle, one of our directors. The notes bore
interest at the prime rate of the Bank of Canada, which has ranged from 2.45 to 3.95 per annum, compounded annually, that was payable
quarterly, and had a maturity date of three years from the date of issuance. As of December 31, 2023, all loans have been repaid and we
had recorded 0 in accrued interest that was included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 

The preparation of consolidated
financial statements requires management to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets
and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements. Estimates and assumptions are continually evaluated and are based
on historical experience and management s assessment of current events and other facts and circumstances that are considered to
be relevant. Actual results could differ from these estimates. 

Significant assumptions about
the future and other sources of estimation uncertainty that management has made at the end of the reporting year, that could result in
a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the event that actual results differ from assumptions made,
relate to, but are not limited to, the following: 

Estimate for excess credit losses 

We apply the Current Expected
Credit Loss (CECL) model under ASC 326 for impairment of financial assets. This model requires the recognition of an allowance for credit
losses based on expected losses over the life of the asset. If the credit risk of a financial asset decreases in a subsequent period,
any previously recognized impairment loss is reversed through profit or loss, limited to the extent that the carrying amount does not
exceed what the amortized cost would have been had the impairment not been recognized. 

Deferred financing costs 

Deferred financing costs
consist primarily of direct incremental costs related to our public offerings of our common stock completed in February 2023. Upon completion
of our public offering and financing any deferred costs were offset against the proceeds. 

26 

Property and equipment 

Property and equipment is
stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, if any. Such cost includes the cost of replacing part
of the property and equipment. All other repair and maintenance costs are recognized in the consolidated statements of operations and
comprehensive loss. The initial cost of property and equipment comprises its purchase price or construction cost and any costs directly
attributable to bringing it to a working condition for its intended use. The purchase price or construction cost is the aggregate amount
of cash consideration paid and the fair value of any other consideration given to acquire the asset. Where an item of property and equipment
is comprised of significant components with different useful lives, the components are accounted for as separate items of property and
equipment. For all property and equipment, depreciation is calculated over the depreciable amount, which is the cost of an asset less
its residual value. Depreciation is calculated starting on the date that property and equipment is available for its intended use. 

Intangible assets 

Intangible assets acquired
separately were measured upon initial recognition at cost, which comprises the purchase price plus any costs directly attributable to
the preparation of the asset for its intended use. Intangible assets acquired through business combinations (Xcite Interactive) or asset
acquisitions were initially recognized at fair value as at the date of acquisition. After initial recognition, intangible assets were
carried at cost less accumulated amortization and any accumulated impairment charges. 

Income taxes 

We account for income taxes
utilizing the assets and liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences
between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis, and net operating
loss and tax credit carry forwards, using enacted tax rates and laws that are expected to be in effect when the differences reverse. 

A valuation allowance is
recorded against deferred tax assets (DTA s) when management does not believe that the realization of DTA s is more likely
than not. While management believes that its judgements and estimates regarding deferred tax assets and liabilities are appropriate, significant
differences in actual results may materially affect our future financial results. 

We recognize any uncertain
income tax positions at the largest amount that is more-likely-than-not to be sustained upon audit by relevant taxing authority. An uncertain
income tax position will not be recognized if it has less than a 50 likelihood of being sustained. Our policy is to recognize interest
and/or penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense. As of September 30, 2024 and 2023, we did not record any accruals
for interest and penalties. We do not foresee material changes to our uncertain tax positions within the next twelve months. 

Determination of share-based payments 

The estimation of share-based
payments (including warrants and stock options) requires the selection of an appropriate valuation model and consideration as to the inputs
necessary for the valuation model chosen. We use the Black-Scholes valuation model at the date of the grant. We make estimates as to the
volatility, the expected life, dividend yield and the time of exercise, as applicable. The expected volatility is based on the average
volatility of share prices of similar companies over the period of the expected life of the applicable warrants and stock options. The
expected life is based on historical data. These estimates may not necessarily be indicative of future actual patterns. 

Deferred revenues and revenue recognition 

Revenue recognition of sales
is recorded on a monthly basis upon delivery or as the services are provided. Cash received in advance for services are recorded as deferred
revenue based on the proportion of time remaining under the service arrangement as of the reporting date. 

27 

Functional currency 

The functional currency for
each of our subsidiaries is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the respective entity operates. Such determination
involves certain judgements to identify the primary economic environment. We reconsider the functional currency of our subsidiaries if
there is a change in events and/or conditions which determine the primary economic environment. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 

Not required under Regulation
S-K for smaller reporting companies. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 

Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Our management, with the
participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, has performed an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure
controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this report, as required
by Rule 13a-15(b) under the Exchange Act. Based upon that evaluation, our management, with the participation of our chief executive officer
and chief financial officer, has concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective in ensuring
that the information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that the information required to be
disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including
our chief executive officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting 

There were no changes in our internal control
over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) that occurred during the fiscal quarter covered by
this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls
over financial reporting. 

28 

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings 

None 

Item 1A. Risk Factors 

Other than as set for below,
there have been no material changes to the risk factors set forth in the section titled Risk Factors included in our Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on April 1, 2024 (our Annual Report ). Our business
involves significant risks. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described in our Annual Report, together with all
of the other information in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, as well as our audited consolidated financial statements and related
notes as disclosed in our Annual Report. The risks and uncertainties described in our Annual Report are not the only ones we face, and
additional risk and uncertainties that we are unaware of or that we deem immaterial may also become important factors that adversely affect
our business. The realization of any of these risks and uncertainties could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business,
financial condition, results of operations, growth and future prospects as well as our ability to accomplish our strategic objectives.
In that event, the market price of our common shares could decline and you could lose part or all of your investment. 

If we do not successfully raise additional
capital, improve our operating cash flow, or complete a strategic transaction, our board of directors may decide to pursue a dissolution
and liquidation of our Company. In such an event, the amount of cash available for distribution to our stockholders will depend heavily
on the timing of such liquidation as well as the amount of cash that must be reserved for commitments and contingent liabilities, as to
which we can give you no assurance. 

There can be no assurance
that we will successfully raise additional capital, that we will improve our operating cash flow, or that we will be able to complete
a strategic transaction. If none of those occur, our board of directors may decide to pursue a dissolution and liquidation of our Company.
In such an event, the amount of cash available for distribution to our stockholders will depend heavily on the timing of such decision
and, ultimately, such liquidation, since the amount of cash available for distribution continues to decrease as we fund our operations
while pursuing a financing, improved operations, or a strategic transaction. As of September 30, 2024, the Company has not achieved positive
cash flow from operations and is not able to finance day to day activities through operations and as such, there is substantial doubt
as to the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. 

In addition, we may be subject
to litigation or other claims related to a dissolution and liquidation of our Company. If a dissolution and liquidation were to be pursued,
our board of directors, in consultation with our advisors, would need to evaluate these matters and make a determination about a reasonable
amount to reserve. Accordingly, holders of our common stock could lose all or a significant portion of their investment in the event of
a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of our Company. A liquidation would be a lengthy and uncertain process with no assurance of any
value ever being returned to our stockholders. 

If we are unable to regain compliance with the listing requirements
of the Nasdaq Capital Market, our common stock may be delisted from the Nasdaq Capital Market which could have a material adverse effect
on our financial condition and could make it difficult for you to sell your shares. 

Our common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market, and we are
therefore subject to its continued listing requirements, including requirements with respect to the market value of publicly held shares,
market value of listed shares, minimum bid price per share, and minimum stockholders' equity, among others, and requirements relating
to board and committee independence. If we fail to satisfy one or more of the requirements, we may be delisted from the Nasdaq Capital
Market. 

On September 16, 2024, we received a notice, or Notice, from the Nasdaq
Stock Market, or Nasdaq, that we are not currently in compliance with the 1.00 minimum bid price requirement for continued listing on
the Nasdaq Capital Market, as set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2), or the Minimum Bid Price Requirement. The Notice indicated
that, consistent with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), we have 180 days, or until March 16, 2025, to regain compliance with the Minimum
Bid Price Requirement by having the bid price of our common stock meet or exceed 1.00 per share for at least ten consecutive business
days. The Notice had no immediate effect on the listing of our common stock, and our common stock continues to trade on the Nasdaq Capital
Market under the symbol VS at this time. 

29 

In the event we do not regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price
Requirement by March 16, 2025, we may be eligible for an additional 180 calendar day compliance period if, on the last day of the initial
compliance period, we meet the market value of publicly held shares requirement for continued listing as well as all other standards for
initial listing of our common stock on The Nasdaq Capital Market, with the exception of the Minimum Bid Price Requirement, and provide
Nasdaq written notice of our intention to cure the bid price deficiency during the second compliance period. If we do not indicate our
intent to cure the deficiency, or if it appears to Nasdaq that it is not possible for us to cure the deficiency, we will not be eligible
for the second compliance period and our common stock will become subject to delisting. In the event that we receive notice that our common
stock is being delisted, the Nasdaq listing rules permit us to appeal a delisting determination by the staff to a hearings panel. 

We intend to actively monitor the bid price of our common stock and
will consider available options to regain compliance with the listing requirements, including such actions as effecting a reverse stock
split, for which our board of directors has received stockholder approval. There can be no assurance, however, that we will be able to
regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement, and even if we do, there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain
compliance with the continued listing requirements for the Nasdaq Capital Market or that our common stock will not be delisted in the
future. In addition, we may be unable to meet other applicable listing requirements of the Nasdaq Capital Market, including maintaining
minimum levels of stockholders equity or market values of our common stock in which case, our common stock could be delisted notwithstanding
our ability to demonstrate compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement. 

Delisting from the Nasdaq Capital Market may adversely affect our ability
to raise additional financing through the public or private sale of equity securities, may significantly affect the ability of investors
to trade our securities and may negatively affect the value and liquidity of our common stock. Delisting also could have other negative
results, including the potential loss of employee confidence, the loss of institutional investors or interest in business development
opportunities. 

If we are delisted from Nasdaq and we are not
able to list our common stock on another exchange, our common stock could be quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board or in the pink sheets. 
As a result, we could face significant adverse consequences includin g,
among others: 

a
limited availability of market quotations for our securities; 

a
determination that our common stock is a penny stock which will require brokers trading in our common stock to adhere to
more stringent rules and possibly result in a reduced level of trading activity in the secondary trading market for our securities; 

a
limited amount of news and little or no analyst coverage for us; 

an
inability to qualify for exemptions from state securities registration requirements, which may require us to comply with applicable state
securities laws; and 

a
decreased ability to issue additional securities (including pursuant to registration statements on Form S-3) or obtain additional financing
in the future.
