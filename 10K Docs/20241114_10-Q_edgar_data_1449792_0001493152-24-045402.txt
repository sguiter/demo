 Notes
to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for the Quarterly Period Ended September 30, 2024 

 (in
thousands, except for share and per share amounts) 

reportable segments as defined in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, as filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (the SEC on July 26, 2024: Electrical Infrastructure Equipment Electrical Infrastructure and Critical Power Solutions Critical Power ). On October 29, 2024, the Company closed on the sale of its Electrical Infrastructure segment. See Note 11
 Subsequent Events . 

Presentation 

The
accompanying unaudited condensed interim consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared pursuant to the rules
of the SEC and reflect the accounts of the Company as of September 30, 2024. Certain information and footnote disclosures, normally
included in annual financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States U.S. GAAP ), have been condensed or omitted pursuant to those rules and regulations. We believe that the disclosures
made are adequate to make the information presented not misleading to the reader. In the opinion of management, all adjustments,
consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, necessary to fairly state the financial position, results of operations and cash
flows with respect to the interim consolidated financial statements have been included. The results of operations for the interim
period are not necessarily indicative of the results for the entire fiscal year. The year-end balance sheet data was derived from
audited consolidated financial statements but this filing does not include all disclosures required by U.S. GAAP for a year-end
balance sheet. 

All
dollar amounts (except share and per share data) presented in the notes to our unaudited condensed interim consolidated financial
statements are stated in thousands of dollars, unless otherwise noted. ASC 740-270 requires the use of an estimated annual effective
tax rate to compute the tax provision during an interim period unless certain exceptions are met. We have used a discrete-period
computation method to calculate taxes for the fiscal nine-month period ended September 30, 2024. The Company is currently in the
process of estimating its annual effective tax rate for the year ending December 31, 2024 and, as such, the annual effective tax rate is unknown. As of September 30, 2024, the Company
continues to provide a 
valuation allowance against its net deferred tax assets since the Company believes it is more likely than not that its deferred tax
assets will not be realized. 

These
unaudited condensed interim consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Pioneer and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All
significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. 

These
unaudited condensed interim consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the risk factors under the heading
 Part II - Item 1A. Risk Factors and the risk factors and the audited consolidated financial statements and notes
thereto of the Company and its subsidiaries included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December
31, 2023, and the Company s Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the periods ended March 31, 2024, and June 30, 2024. 

Liquidity 

The
accompanying condensed interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the
realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. As shown in the accompanying
consolidated financial statements, as of September 30, 2024, the Company had of cash on hand and working capital of .
The cash on hand was generated primarily from the sale of common stock under the ATM Program (as defined below). On October 20,
2020, we entered into an At the Market Sale Agreement with H.C. Wainwright Co., LLC Wainwright ), pursuant to
which we may offer and sell our shares of common stock from time to time through Wainwright, acting as sales agent or principal (the
 ATM Program ). Since October 20, 2020, and through September 30, 2024, the Company sold an aggregate of 
shares of common stock for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately , before any sales agent fees and expenses payable by us
under the ATM Program. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company sold an aggregate of shares of common
stock for an aggregate consideration of approximately , before any sales agent fees and expenses payable by the Company under
the ATM Program. As of September 30, 2024, of common stock remained available for issuance under the ATM Program. 

On October 29, 2024, the Company closed on the sale
of its Pioneer Custom Electrical Products, LLC subsidiary for gross cash proceeds of . See Note 11 Subsequent Events . 

The
Company has historically met its cash needs through a combination of cash flows from operating activities and bank borrowings, the
completion of the sale of the transformer business units in August 2019 and the sale of common stock under the ATM Program.
Historically, the Company s cash requirements were generally for operating activities, debt repayment, capital improvements
and acquisitions. The Company expects to meet its cash needs with the working capital and cash flows from the Company s
operating activities and proceeds from the sale of its subsidiary. The Company expects its cash requirements to be generally for operating activities, product development and
capital improvements. The Company expects that its current cash balance is sufficient to fund operations for the next twelve months
from the date our unaudited condensed interim consolidated financial statements are issued. 

Risks
and Uncertainties 

The
continuing impacts of the rising interest rates, inflation, changes in foreign currency exchange rates and geopolitical
developments, such as the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine, and the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas, have
resulted, and may continue to result, in a global slowdown of economic activity, which may decrease demand for a broad variety of
goods and services, including those provided by the Company s clients, while also disrupting supply channels, sales channels
and advertising and marketing activities for an unknown period of time. As a result of the current uncertainty in economic activity,
the Company is unable to predict the potential size and duration of the impact on its revenue and its results of operations, if any.
The extent of the potential impact of these macroeconomic factors on the Company s operational and financial performance will
depend on a variety of factors, including the extent of geopolitical disruption and its impact on the Company s clients,
partners, industry, and employees, all of which are uncertain at this time and cannot be accurately predicted. The Company continues
to monitor the effects of these macroeconomic factors and intends to take steps deemed appropriate to limit the impact on its
business. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company was able to operate substantially at
capacity. 

There
can be no assurance that precautionary measures, whether adopted by the Company or imposed by others, will be effective, and such measures
could negatively affect its sales, marketing, and client service efforts, delay and lengthen its sales cycles, decrease its employees ,
clients , or partners productivity, or create operational or other challenges, any of which could harm its business and
results of operations. 

and of reserves for expected credit losses as of September 30, 2024, and
December 31, 2023, respectively. 

2) 
 Identify the performance obligations in the contract 

Performance
obligations promised in a contract are identified based on the products or services that will be transferred to the customer that are
both capable of being distinct, whereby the customer can benefit from the product or service either on its own or together with other
resources that are readily available from third parties or from the Company, and are distinct in the context of the contract, whereby
the transfer of the products or services is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract. To the extent a contract includes
multiple promised products or services, the Company must apply judgment to determine whether promised products or services are capable
of being distinct and distinct in the context of the contract. If these criteria are not met the promised products or services are accounted
for as a combined performance obligation. 

3) 
 Determine the transaction
 price 

The
transaction price is determined based on the consideration to which the Company will be entitled in exchange for transferring products
or services to the customer. The customer payments are generally due in 30 days. 

4) 
 Allocate the transaction price to performance obligations
in the contract 

If
the contract contains a single performance obligation, the entire transaction price is allocated to the single performance obligation.
Contracts that contain multiple performance obligations require an allocation of the transaction price to each performance obligation
based on a relative standalone selling price basis. The Company determines standalone selling price based on the price at which the performance
obligation is sold separately. If the standalone selling price is not observable through past transactions, the Company estimates the
standalone selling price taking into account available information such as market conditions and internally approved pricing guidelines
related to the performance obligations. 

5) 
 Recognize revenue when or as the Company satisfies a performance
obligation 

The
Company satisfies performance obligations either over time or at a point in time. Revenue is recognized at the time the related performance
obligation is satisfied by transferring a promised product or service to a customer. 

During
the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recognized of revenue over time, as compared to during the three
months ended September 30, 2023. Additionally, the Company recognized and of revenue at a point in time from the sale of
our products during the three months ended September 30, 2024, and September 30, 2023, respectively. 

Service
revenues include maintenance contracts that are recognized over time based on the contract term and repair services which are recognized
as services are delivered. The Company recognized and of service revenue during the three months ended September 30, 2024,
and September 30, 2023, respectively. 

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recognized of revenue over time, as compared to during the nine
months ended September 30, 2023. Additionally, the Company recognized and of revenue at a point in time from the sale
of our products during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and September 30, 2023, respectively.

During
the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recognized approximately of revenue that was classified as deferred revenue
as of December 31, 2023, as compared to of revenue recognized during the three months ended September 30, 2023 that was classified

reporting periods. 

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recognized approximately of revenue that was classified as deferred revenue
as of December 31, 2023, as compared to of revenue recognized during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 that was classified
as deferred revenue as of December 31, 2022, resulting primarily from the progress made on the various active contracts during the respective
reporting periods. 

The
Company manages its accounts receivable credit risk by performing credit evaluations and monitoring amounts due from the Company s
customers. The Company had certain customers whose revenue individually represented 10 or more of the Company s total revenue,
or whose accounts receivable balances individually represented 10 or more of the Company s total accounts receivable. 

As
of September 30, 2024, one customer represented approximately of the Company s accounts receivable. As of December 31, 2023,

ended September 30, 2023, two customers represented approximately and of the Company s revenue. 

Return
of a product requires that the buyer obtain permission in writing from the Company. When the buyer requests authorization to return material
for reasons of their own, the buyer will be charged for placing the returned goods in saleable condition, restocking charges and for
any outgoing and incoming transportation paid by the Company. The Company warrants title to the products, and warrants the products on
date of shipment to the buyer, to be of the kind and quality described in the contract, merchantable, and free of defects in workmanship
and material. Returns and warranties during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, and September 30, 2023, were insignificant.

Lease
revenues (Topic 842) 

ASC
842 revenues pertain to revenues and expenses related to the leasing of electric generators. 

The
Company accounts for such rentals as operating leases. The lease terms are included in the Company s contracts, and the determination
of whether the Company s contracts contain leases generally does not require significant assumptions or judgments. The Company s
lease revenues do include variable lease payments based on hours. Revenues attributable to the variable lease payments are recognized
when earned. There were no leasing revenues arising from variable lease payments during the three and nine months ended September 30,
2024, and 2023. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, leasing revenues were and , respectively, and are included in revenue from products. For the three

Company does not provide an option for the lessee to purchase the rented equipment at the end of the lease. Lessees do not provide residual
value guarantees on rented equipment.

Selling,
General and Administrative Expense . For the three months ended September 30, 2024, consolidated selling, general and administrative
expense, before depreciation and amortization, increased by approximately 155, or 5.7 , to 2,881, as compared to 2,726 during the
three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to an increase in professional fees. As a percentage of our consolidated
revenue, selling, general and administrative expense, before depreciation and amortization, increased to 26.4 during the three months
ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 23.8 in the three months ended September 30, 2023. 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, consolidated selling, general and administrative expense, before depreciation and amortization,
increased by approximately 360, or 4.6 , to 8,176, as compared to 7,816 during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily
due to an increase in travel related costs. As a percentage of our consolidated revenue, selling, general and administrative expense,
before depreciation and amortization, increased to 31.6 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 23.5 in the
nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

Depreciation
and Amortization Expense. Depreciation and amortization expense consists primarily of depreciation of fixed assets and amortization
of right-of-use assets related to our finance leases, and excludes amounts included in cost of sales. For the three months ended September
30, 2024, consolidated depreciation and amortization expense decreased by 6, or 18.8 , to 26, as compared to 32 during the three months
ended September 30, 2023. 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, consolidated depreciation and amortization expense decreased by 119, or 63.3 , to 69, as
compared to 188 during the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

Electrical
Infrastructure . Operating income from our Electrical Infrastructure segment decreased by 3,047 during the three months ended September
30, 2024, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to a decrease in sales of our electrical infrastructure
equipment and an increase in selling, general and administrative expense. 

Operating
income from our Electrical Infrastructure segment decreased by 7,832 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to
the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to a decrease in sales of our electrical infrastructure equipment and an increase
in selling, general and administrative expense. 

Critical
Power Solutions . Operating income from our Critical Power segment increased by 832 during the three months ended September 30, 2024,
as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to an increase in sales of our e-Boost equipment from our Pioneer
eMobility business in addition to an increase in service sales. 

Operating
loss from our Critical Power segment decreased by 605 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months
ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to an increase in sales of our e-Boost equipment from our Pioneer eMobility business in addition
to an increase in service sales. 

General
Corporate Expense . Our general corporate expenses consist primarily of executive management, corporate accounting and human resources
personnel, corporate office expenses, financing and corporate development activities, payroll and benefits administration, treasury,
tax compliance, legal, stock-based compensation, public reporting costs and costs not specifically allocated to reportable business segments. 

During
the three months ended September 30, 2024, our unallocated corporate overhead expense decreased by 178, or 16.1 , as compared to the
three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to a decrease in stock-based compensation expense. 

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our unallocated corporate overhead expense decreased by 319, or 9.0 , as compared to the nine
months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to a decrease in stock-based compensation expense. 

21 

Non-Operating
Expense (Income) 

Interest
Expense (Income) . For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we had interest expense of approximately 23 and interest
income of approximately 25, respectively, as compared to interest income of approximately 60 and 192, respectively, during the three
and nine months ended September 30, 2023. We generated the majority of our interest income from our cash on hand during the nine months
ended September 30, 2024, and 2023. 

Other
Expense (Income) . Other expense (income) in the consolidated statements of operations reports certain gains and losses associated
with activities not directly related to our core operations. 

For
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we had other non-operating expense of 1 and other non-operating income 39, respectively,
as compared to other non-operating income of 11 and 4, respectively, during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

Provision
for Income Taxes . Our effective income tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023 was 0.0 . 

Net
Loss (Income) per Share 

We
generated a net loss of 1,121 during the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to net income of 1,011 during the three
months ended September 30, 2023. 

Our
net loss per basic and diluted share for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was 0.10, as compared to net income per basic share
of 0.10 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 

We
generated a net loss of 4,439 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to net income of 2,601 during the nine months
ended September 30, 2023. 

Our
net loss per basic and diluted share for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was 0.42, as compared to net income per basic share
of 0.26 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

LIQUIDITY
AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 

General .
On October 20, 2020, we entered into an At the Market Sale Agreement with H.C. Wainwright Co., LLC Wainwright ),
pursuant to which we may offer and sell our shares of common stock from time to time through Wainwright, acting as sales agent or principal
(the ATM Program ). As of September 30, 2024, the Company had 3,080 of cash on hand generated primarily from the sale of
common stock under the ATM Program. Since October 20, 2020, and through September 30, 2024, the Company sold an aggregate of 1,835,616
shares of common stock for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately 14,051, before any sales agent fees and expenses payable by us
under the ATM Program. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company sold an aggregate of 919,557 shares of common stock
for an aggregate consideration of approximately 5,147, before any sales agent fees and expenses payable by the Company under the ATM
Program. As of September 30, 2024, 69,853 of common stock remained available for issuance under the ATM Program. 

The
continuing impacts of the rising interest rates, inflation, changes in foreign currency exchange rates and geopolitical developments,
such as the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine, and the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas, have resulted, and may continue
to result, in a global slowdown of economic activity, which may decrease demand for a broad variety of goods and services, including
those provided by our clients, while also disrupting supply channels, sales channels and advertising and marketing activities for an
unknown period of time. As a result of the current uncertainty in economic activity, we are unable to predict the potential size and
duration of the impact on our revenue and our results of operations, if any. The extent of the potential impact of these macroeconomic
factors on our operational and financial performance will depend on a variety of factors, including the extent of geopolitical disruption
and its impact on our clients, partners, industry, and employees, all of which are uncertain at this time and cannot be accurately predicted.
We continue to monitor the effects of these macroeconomic factors and intends to take steps deemed appropriate to limit the impact on
our business. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we were able to operate substantially at capacity. 

There
can be no assurance that precautionary measures, whether adopted by us or imposed by others, will be effective, and such measures could
negatively affect our sales, marketing, and client service efforts, delay and lengthen our sales cycles, decrease our employees ,
clients , or partners productivity, or create operational or other challenges, any of which could harm our business and
results of operations. 

Cash
Used in Operating Activities . Cash used in our operating activities was 4,118 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as
compared to 228 during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in cash used in operating activities is primarily due
to the increase in our net loss and working capital fluctuations. 

22 

Cash
Used in Investing Activities. Cash used in investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was 1,277, as compared
to 2,345 during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Additions to property and equipment during the nine months ended September
30, 2024, were 1,277, as compared to 2,345 of additions during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

Cash
Provided by/ (Used in) Financing Activities. Cash provided by our financing activities was 4,893 during the nine months ended September
30, 2024, as compared to cash used in financing activities of 142 during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in cash
provided by financing activities is primarily due to the sale of common stock under the ATM Program. 

Working
Capital . As of September 30, 2024, we had working capital of 9,103, including 3,080 of cash on hand, compared to working capital
of 9,421, including 3,582 of cash on hand as of December 31, 2023. 

Assessment
of Liquidity . As of September 30, 2024, we had 3,080 of cash on hand generated primarily from the sale of common stock under
the ATM Program. We have historically met our cash needs through a combination of cash flows from operating activities and bank
borrowings, the completion of the sale of the transformer business units in August 2019 and the sale of common stock under the ATM
Program. Historically, our cash requirements were generally for operating activities, debt repayment, capital improvements and
acquisitions. 

On
October 29, 2024, we closed on the sale of our Pioneer Custom Electrical Products, LLC subsidiary for gross cash proceeds of 48,000. 

We
expect to meet our cash needs with our working capital and cash flows from operating activities. We expect our cash requirements to
be generally for operating activities, capital improvements and product development. We expect that product development and
promotional activities related to our new initiatives will continue in the near future and we expect to continue to incur costs
related to such activities. We expect that our cash balance is sufficient to fund operations for the next twelve months from the
date our unaudited condensed interim consolidated financial statements are issued. 

As
of September 30, 2024, we had no off-balance sheet transactions, arrangements, obligations (including contingent obligations), or other
relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons that had, or that may have, a material effect on our financial condition,
changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. 

Capital
Expenditures 

The
Company had 1,277 of additions to property and equipment during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 2,345 of additions
to property and equipment during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

Known
Trends, Events, Uncertainties and Factors That May Affect Future Operations 

We
believe that our future operating results will continue to be subject to quarterly variations based upon a wide variety of factors, including
the cyclical nature of the electrical equipment industry and the markets for our products and services. Our operating results could also
be impacted by changing customer requirements and exposure to fluctuations in prices of important raw supplies, such as copper, steel
and aluminum. We have various insurance policies, including cybersecurity, covering risks in amounts that we consider adequate. In addition
to these measures, we attempt to recover other cost increases through improvements to our manufacturing efficiency and through increases
in prices where competitively feasible. Lastly, other economic conditions we cannot foresee may affect customer demand. In addition,
the consequences of the ongoing geopolitical conflicts, such as the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine and the ongoing conflict
between Israel and Hamas, including related sanctions and countermeasures, and the effects of rising global inflation, are difficult
to predict, and could adversely impact geopolitical and macroeconomic conditions, the global economy, and contribute to increased market
volatility, which may in turn adversely affect our business and operations. We predominately sell to customers in the industrial production
and commercial construction markets. Accordingly, changes in the condition of any of our customers may have a greater impact than if
our sales were more evenly distributed between different end markets. For a further discussion of factors that may affect future operating
results see the sections entitled Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q
and Part I - Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Not

ITEM
4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Our
management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer CEO and Chief Financial Officer CFO ), evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and
15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), as of September 30, 2024. Our
disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information we are required to disclose in the
reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our CEO and CFO, as
appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures, and is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within
the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Based on this evaluation, and as a result of the material weaknesses
described below, our CEO and CFO have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30,
2024. In light of this determination, our management has performed additional analyses, reconciliations, and other post-closing
procedures and has concluded that, notwithstanding the material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, the
unaudited condensed interim consolidated financial statements for the periods covered by and included in this Quarterly
Report on Form 10-Q fairly state, in all material respects, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the
periods presented in conformity with U.S. GAAP. 

Material
Weaknesses in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

A
material weakness, as defined in the standards established by Sarbanes-Oxley, is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in
internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or
unaudited condensed interim consolidated financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. 

Internal
control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The following material weaknesses in our internal control over
financial reporting were present as of December 31, 2023, and continued to exist as of September 30, 2024: 

The
 Company did not maintain effective controls over the revenue recognition of over-time contracts and associated costs. The Company s
 underlying estimates of total labor hours required to complete over-time contracts were materially different from the actual labor
 hours required, which was determined to represent an error, and, as a result, the percentage of completion used to recognize revenue
 was materially different from the percentage of completion using actual labor hours incurred. Additionally, the Company did not properly
 account for recognition of costs incurred by contract. This material weakness resulted in the restatement of the Company s
 consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2022, as well as its interim consolidated financial statements
 for the three months ended March 31, 2022, and 2023, the three and nine months ended June 30, 2022, and 2023 and the three and nine
 months ended September 30, 2022, and 2023. 

The
 Company did not design and maintain effective controls over the accounting for inventory and related cost of sales, primarily due
 to the lack of an automated tracking system and the manual nature of its current processes and controls surrounding inventory. Specifically,
 we did not design and maintain effective controls over (1) complete and accurate inventory costing, including recording inventoriable
 costs at the lower of cost and net realizable value, (2) cycle count procedures and inventory system changes, which occur without
 proper review and documentation and (3) proper segregation of duties. 

The
 Company has a lack of sufficient accounting personnel with the necessary skills, knowledge, and expertise. This deficiency impacts
 our ability to ensure appropriate segregation of duties, and to accurately and timely close, consolidate and prepare financial statements
 as required to maintain compliance with reporting deadlines under applicable SEC regulations. 

Management s
Plan to Remediate the Material Weaknesses 

The
Company is implementing enhancements to its internal controls to remediate the identified material weaknesses in its internal control
over financial reporting. Specifically, the Company has: 

engaged
 external third parties for assistance as needed; 

initiated
 a review and update of significant accounting policies, procedures, and controls; and 

begun
 additional training for its accounting and financial reporting personnel. 

Additionally,
the Company plans to hire additional accounting and finance personnel with the requisite skills, knowledge and expertise to address identified
control deficiencies. 

The
Company is committed to maintaining a strong internal control environment and believes these remediation efforts will represent significant
improvements in its controls over the control environment. These steps will take time to be fully implemented and confirmed to be effective
and sustainable. Additional controls may also be required over time. While the Company believes that these efforts will improve its internal
control over financial reporting, the Company will not be able to conclude whether the steps the Company is taking will remediate the
material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting until a sufficient period of time has passed to allow management to
test the design and operational effectiveness of the new and enhanced controls. Until the remediation steps set forth above are fully
implemented and tested, the material weaknesses described above will continue to exist. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

Other
than described above, there have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the three months
ended September 30, 2024, that have materially affected, or that are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over
financial reporting.

PART
II OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM
1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 

From
time to time, we may become involved in lawsuits, investigations and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business. 

On
June 15, 2023, Terrence and Kay Mimick (the Plaintiffs filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court, District of Nebraska
naming the Company, its wholly-owned subsidiary, Pioneer Critical Power, Inc., and an individual acting in his capacity as an employee
of the Company, collectively as defendants. Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint on July 7, 2023, alleging negligent driving, negligent
entrustment, and negligent hiring, training and supervision, as a result of a car accident that occurred on September 9, 2019, and seeking
special damages related to the injuries allegedly sustained by Plaintiffs. The amended complaint also named Titan Energy Systems, Inc.
as a defendant instead of Pioneer Critical Power, Inc. On July 27, 2023, the defendants filed an Answer to Plaintiff s Amended
Complaint. On October 6, 2023, a mediation was held, but the parties did not reach a settlement. In June 2024, another mediation was
held and the parties reached a settlement for all of the Plaintiffs claims. The case was dismissed with prejudice on July 23,
2024. 

As
of the date hereof, we are not aware of or a party to any other legal proceedings to which we or any of our subsidiaries is a party or
to which any of our property is subject, nor are we aware of any such threatened or pending litigation or any such proceedings known
to be contemplated by governmental authorities that we believe could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition
or operating results. 

We
can give no assurance that any other lawsuits or claims brought in the future will not have an adverse effect on our financial condition,
liquidity or operating results. 

We
are not aware of any material proceedings in which any of our directors, officers or affiliates or any registered or beneficial shareholder
of more than 5 of our common stock is an adverse party or has a material interest adverse to our interest. 

ITEM
1A. RISK FACTORS 

A
description of the risks associated with our business, financial condition and results of operations is set forth in Item 1A.
Risk Factors of our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, as filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission on July 26, 2024, and are supplemented with the following revised risk factor: 

We
currently derive a significant portion of our revenues from two customers. Material or significant loss of business from these customers
could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. 

We
depend on two customers for a large portion of our business, and any change in the level of orders from these customers could have a
significant impact on our results of operations. Approximately 26 and 11 of our sales during the three and nine months ended September
30, 2024, respectively, were made to one customer, and approximately 10 of our sales during the three months ended September 30, 2024,
were made to another customer. Loss of business from these customers could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition
and operating results. The majority of our sales to these customers were made pursuant to contract terms and conditions for each project.
