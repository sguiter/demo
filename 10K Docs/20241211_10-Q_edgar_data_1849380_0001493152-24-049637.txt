CAUTIONARY
NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 

Certain
statements that we make from time to time, including statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q Form 10-Q constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, and of
Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ). All statements other than statements of historical facts contained in this
Form 10-Q are forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements in this Form 10-Q are only predictions. We have based
these forward-looking statements largely on our current expectations and projections about future events and financial trends that we
believe may affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. In some cases, you can identify these forward-looking
statements by terms such as anticipate, believe, continue, could, depends, 
 estimate, expects, intend, may, ongoing, plan, potential, 
 predict, project, should, will, would or the negative of those
terms or other similar expressions, although not all forward-looking statements contain those words. We have based these forward-looking
statements on our current expectations and projections about future events and trends that we believe may affect our financial condition,
results of operations, strategy, short- and long-term business operations and objectives, and financial needs. 

Our
operations involve risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside our control, and any one of which, or a combination of which, could
materially affect our results of operations and whether the forward-looking statements ultimately prove to be correct. We have based
these forward-looking statements largely on our current expectations and projections about future events and trends that we believe may
affect our financial condition, results of operations, business strategy, short-term and long-term business operations and objectives,
and financial needs. Forward-looking statements in this Form 10-Q include, without limitation, statements reflecting management s
expectations for future financial performance and operating expenditures (including our ability to continue as a going concern, to raise
additional capital and to succeed in our future operations), expected growth, profitability and business outlook, and operating expenses. 

Forward-looking
statements are only current predictions and are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and other factors that may cause our
actual results, levels of activity, performance, or achievements to be materially different from those anticipated by such statements.
These factors include, among other things, the unknown risks and uncertainties that we believe could cause actual results to differ from
these forward looking statements as set forth under the heading, Risk Factors and elsewhere in this Form 10-Q and other documents we file with the SEC.
New risks and uncertainties emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict all of the risks and uncertainties that
could have an impact on the forward-looking statements, including without limitation, risks and uncertainties relating to: 

our
 projected financial position and estimated cash burn rate; 

our
 estimates regarding expenses, future revenues and capital requirements; 

our
 ability to continue as a going concern; 

our
 ability to raise substantial additional capital in sufficient amounts or on acceptable terms
 to fund our operations and our business plan; 

our
 ability to reverse the recent decline in our revenue and resume growing our revenue; 

our
 ability to obtain and maintain intellectual property protection for our current products
 and services; 

our
 ability to protect our intellectual property rights and the potential for us to incur substantial
 costs from lawsuits to enforce or protect our intellectual property rights; 

the
 possibility that a third party may claim we have infringed, misappropriated or otherwise
 violated their intellectual property rights and that we may incur substantial costs and be
 required to devote substantial time defending against these claims; 

our
 reliance on third-party suppliers; 

the
 success of competing products or services that are or become available; 

our
 ability to expand our organization to accommodate potential growth and our ability to retain
 and attract key personnel; and 

the
 potential for us to incur substantial costs resulting from lawsuits against us and the potential
 for these lawsuits to cause us to limit our commercialization of our products and services. 

These
forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks, uncertainties and assumptions, including those described in Risk
Factors in our Form 10-K/A and in other documents we file with the SEC. Moreover, we operate in a very competitive and rapidly
changing environment. New risks emerge from time to time. It is not possible for our management to predict all risks, nor can we assess
the impact of all factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ
materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements we may make. In light of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions,
the forward-looking events and circumstances discussed in this Form 10-Q may not occur,
and actual results could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated or implied in the forward-looking statements. 

You
should not rely upon forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. Although we believe that the expectations reflected
in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee that the future results, levels of activity, performance or events
and circumstances reflected in the forward-looking statements will be achieved or occur. Moreover, except as required by law, neither
we nor any other person assumes responsibility for the accuracy and completeness of the forward-looking statements. We undertake no obligation
to update publicly any forward-looking statements for any reason after the date of this Form 10-Q to conform these statements to actual
results or to changes in our expectations. 

You
should read this Form 10-Q and the documents that we incorporate by reference in this Form 10-Q with the understanding that our actual
future results, levels of activity, performance and events and circumstances may be materially different from what we expect. As a result
of a number of known and unknown risks and uncertainties, our actual results or performance may be materially different from those expressed
or implied by these forward-looking statements including those described in this Form 10-Q and in the Risk Factors section
of our Form 10-K/A and other documents we file with the SEC.

NOTES
TO THE UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

million and million for the three and six months ended
June 30, 2024, respectively. In addition, the Company had an accumulated deficit of million as of June 30, 2024. The Company s unrestricted
cash balance of million is not adequate to fund its operations through at least twelve months from the date these condensed consolidated
financial statements were available for issuance. Therefore, these conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability
to continue as a going concern. 

To
continue in existence and expand its operations, the Company will be required to, and management plans to, raise additional working capital
through an equity or debt offering and ultimately hopes to attain profitable operations to fulfill its operating and capital requirements
for at least 12 months from the date of the issuance of the condensed consolidated financial statements. However, the Company may not
be able to secure such financing in a timely manner or on favorable terms, if at all. Furthermore, if the Company issues equity securities
to raise additional funds, its existing stockholders may experience dilution, and the new equity securities may have rights, preferences
and privileges senior to those of the Company s existing stockholders. The condensed consolidated financial statements do not include
any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of assets and liabilities that might be necessary should the Company
be unable to continue as a going concern. The Company s continuation as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to continue
receiving working capital cash payments and generating cash flow from operations. 

Risks
and uncertainties 

The
Company is subject to risks common to companies in the markets it serves, including, but not limited to, global economic and financial
market conditions, fluctuations in customer demand, acceptance of new products, development by its competitors of new technological innovations,
dependence on key personnel, and protection of proprietary technology. 

Segment
information 

The
Company operates in one operating segment and, accordingly, no segment disclosures have been presented herein. 

per share Common Stock at cost on the trade date of the transaction. These shares are considered treasury stock,
which is a reduction to stockholders equity (deficit). Treasury stock is included in authorized and issued shares but
excluded from outstanding shares. 

or 
annually from the date of issuance until the outstanding principal was paid or converted. In connection with the issuance of
Convertible Promissory Notes in 2022 and 2023, the Company also issued warrants at an exercise price of 
per share (the Convertible Promissory Notes Warrants ). See additional information on the accounting for the warrants
in Note 9. 

The
Convertible Promissory Notes were issued for general working capital purposes. The Company elected the fair value option FVO of accounting under ASC 825, Financial Instruments , for
its Convertible Promissory Notes. Under the FVO election, the financial instrument is initially measured at its issue-date estimated
fair value and subsequently remeasured at estimated fair value on a recurring basis at each reporting period date. The estimated
fair value adjustment is presented as a single line item within other expense (income), net in the accompanying condensed
consolidated statements of operations under the caption change in fair value of convertible promissory notes. 

In
November 2023, all Convertible Promissory Notes were converted pursuant to their provision in connection with the Business Combination
between Data Knights and Legacy ONMD and were no longer outstanding as of December 31, 2023. See the Form 10-K/A for all other details
relating to the Convertible Promissory Notes issued prior to December 31, 2023. 

PIPE
Notes 

On
June 28, 2023, The PIPE Notes mature on the first anniversary of the issuance date, or November 7, 2024. 

The
Company elected the FVO of accounting for its PIPE Notes. The estimated fair value adjustment is presented as a single line item
within other expense (income), net in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations under the caption
change in fair value of PIPE Notes. As of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the fair value of the PIPE Notes was 
million and 
million, respectively, which is included in current liabilities on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. 

Shareholder
Loans 

From
January to June 2024, the Company received gross proceeds of 
million in connection with shareholder loans with a related party investor which are convertible into 
shares of Common Stock at a conversion price of 
per share. These loans do not bear interest and mature from issuance. The balance of 
million is included in loan related party on the condensed consolidated balance sheet as of June 30, 2024. 

Helena
Notes 

On
March 28, 2024, the Company entered into a definitive securities purchase agreement (the Helena SPA with Helena
Global Investment Opportunities 1 Ltd. Helena ), an affiliate of Helena Partners Inc., a Cayman Islands-based
advisor and investor providing for up to 
million in funding through a private placement for the issuance of senior secured convertible notes and warrants across multiple
tranches. The Helena SPA was subsequently terminated in June 2024 prior to the closing of any tranches (the Helena
Termination Agreement ). As such, except as described below, the Helena SPA had no impact on the Company s condensed
consolidated financial statements as of and for the six months ended June 30,
2024. 

Pursuant
to the Helena Termination Agreement, the Company agreed to issue to Helena a warrant to purchase shares of Common Stock at an
exercise price of per share (the Helena Termination Warrants and agreed to reimburse Helena for certain reasonable
and documented out-of-pocket legal fees and expenses incurred in connection with entry into the Helena SPA and Helena Termination Agreement
and related documents. The Company incurred legal fees and expenses of thousand in connection with the Helena Termination Agreement.
As of June 30, 2024, the Helena Termination Warrants were not yet issued or outstanding. However, in accordance with the loss contingency
guidance of ASC Topic 450, Contingencies , the Company determined that it was probable that a liability had been incurred (its
obligation to issue warrants) and the amount of the loss could be reasonably estimated (the fair value of warrants at an exercise
price of per share). Therefore, the Company recorded stock warrant expense of thousand in its condensed consolidated statement
of operations, with an offsetting liability to accounts payable and accrued expenses on its condensed consolidated balance sheet. The
Company will reclassify the contingent liability to equity or warrant liabilities under applicable guidance when the Helena Termination
Warrants are issued, which occurred in December 2024. 

Yorkville
Note 

On
June 17, 2024, the Company entered into a Standby Equity Purchase Agreement SEPA with YA II PN, LTD, a Cayman Islands exempt limited partnership
managed by Yorkville Advisors Global, LP Yorkville (see Note 6). Upon entry into the SEPA, the Company issued Yorkville a
 
million convertible promissory note for 
million in cash (after a 
original issue discount) (the Yorkville Note ). The Yorkville Note does not bear interest and matures on . The Floor Price is 
per share, subject to the Company s option to reduce the Floor Price to any amounts set forth in a written notice to
Yorkville. Upon the occurrence and during the continuation of an event of default (as defined in the Yorkville Note), the Yorkville
Note will become immediately due and payable. The issuance of the Common Stock upon conversion of the note and otherwise under the
SEPA is capped at 
of the outstanding Common Stock as of June 18, 2024. Further, the note and SEPA include a beneficial ownership blocker for Yorkville
such that Yorkville may not be deemed the beneficial owner of more than 
of the Company s Common Stock. As a result of the Company s failure to file its Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended
June 30, 2024 by August 14, 2024 (i.e., a deemed Event of Default under the Yorkville Note), the Company began accruing interest at
the default rate of 
as of August 14, 2024. A further event of default occurred as a result of the Company s failure to file a registration
statement with the SEC for the resale by Yorkville of the shares of Common Stock issuable under the SEPA by August 30, 2024 (see
Note 6). As such, the full unpaid principal amount of the Yorkville Note may become

Standby
Equity Purchase Agreement 

On
June 17, 2024, the Company and Yorkville entered into the SEPA. Under the SEPA, the Company has the right to sell to Yorkville up to
 
 million of its Common Stock, subject to certain
limitations and conditions set forth in the SEPA, from time to time, over a 24-month period. Sales of the Common Stock to Yorkville under
the SEPA, and the timing of any such sales, are at the Company s option, and the Company is under no obligation to sell any shares
of Common Stock to Yorkville under the SEPA except in connection with notices that may be submitted by Yorkville, in certain circumstances
as described below. 

Upon
the satisfaction of the conditions precedent in the SEPA, which include having a resale shelf for shares of Common Stock issued to
Yorkville declared effective, the Company has the right to direct Yorkville to purchase a specified number of shares of Common Stock
by delivering written notice (each an Advance ). 

Yorkville
will generally purchase shares pursuant to an Advance at a price per share equal to 97 of the VWAP, on Nasdaq during the three consecutive
trading days commencing on the date of the delivery of the Advance (unless the Company specifies a minimum acceptable price or
there is no VWAP on the subject trading day). 

The
SEPA will automatically terminate on the earliest to occur of (i) the first day of the month next following the 24-month anniversary
of the date of the SEPA or (ii) the date on which Yorkville shall have made payment for shares of Common Stock equal to million.
The Company has the right to terminate the SEPA at no cost or penalty upon five trading days prior written notice to Yorkville,
provided that there are no outstanding advances for which shares of Common Stock need to be issued and the Yorkville Note has been paid
in full. The Company and Yorkville may also agree to terminate the SEPA by mutual written consent. 

As
consideration for Yorkville s commitment to purchase the shares of Common Stock pursuant to the SEPA, the Company paid
Yorkville a 
thousand cash structuring fee. In addition, the Company must pay a commitment fee in shares equal to 
million. As of June 30, 2024, the 
million commitment fee was included in accounts payable and accrued expenses in the condensed consolidated balance sheet. In
September 2024, the Company paid an equivalent of the commitment fee by issuing to Yorkville 
shares of Common Stock. 

In
connection with the entry into the SEPA, on June 17, 2024, the Company entered into a registration rights agreement with Yorkville, pursuant
to which the Company agreed to file with the SEC no later than August 30, 2024, a registration statement for the resale by Yorkville
of the shares of Common Stock issued under the SEPA (including the commitment fee shares). The Company agreed to use commercially reasonable
efforts to have such registration statement declared effective within 30 days of such filing and to maintain the effectiveness of such
registration statement during the 24-month commitment period. The Company will not have the ability to request any Advances under the
SEPA (nor may Yorkville convert the Yorkville Note into Common Stock) until such resale registration statement is declared effective
by the SEC. The Company has not yet filed a registration statement with the SEC for the resale by Yorkville of the shares of Common Stock
issued under the SEPA, which is deemed an event of default under the SEPA and as a result, a payment of million became due on October
15, 2024. The million due includes the outstanding principal of million, accrued and unpaid interest, and a payment premium
of 10 . As described in Note 3, the Company subsequently engaged in discussions with Yorkville regarding the events of default, which
discussions are ongoing. 

The SEPA was accounted for as a liability under ASC 815 as it includes an embedded put option and an embedded forward option. The put
option is recognized at inception and the forward option is recognized upon issuance of notice for the sale of the Company s Common
Stock. The fair value of the derivative liability related to the embedded put option was estimated at million at the inception of
the agreement and as of June 30, 2024. The embedded forward option was deemed to have value as there were no notices for the sale of
the Company s Common Stock as of June 30, 2024.

Convertible
Promissory Notes Warrants 

As
described in Note 3, the Company issued Convertible Promissory Notes Warrants in 2022 and 2023. The Convertible Promissory Notes Warrants
are classified as equity in accordance with ASC Subtopic 815-40, Derivatives and Hedging - Contracts in Entity s Own Equity
 ASC 815-40 ). The Company determined that the fair value of the combined instrument (inclusive of the Convertible Promissory
Notes) significantly exceeded the proceeds received; therefore, the Company concluded that the Convertible Promissory Notes Warrants are
most accurately portrayed as an issuance cost related to the Convertible Promissory Notes. This resulted in an expense of million
and million being allocated to the Convertible Promissory Notes Warrants during the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, respectively, which is classified as stock warrant expense in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. 

In
connection with the closing of the Business Combination on November 7, 2023, all Convertible Promissory Notes Warrants were cashless
exercised into shares of Legacy ONMD common stock and exchanged based on the appropriate conversion ratio for the Common Stock less an

value of PIPE Warrants of

thousand, respectively.

connection with the closing of the Business Combination on November 7, 2023, the Company assumed private warrants to purchase
Common Stock at an exercise price of per share (the Private Placement Warrants ). The Private Placement Warrants

months ended June 30, 2024, the Company recognized a change in fair value of Private Placement Warrants of thousand and thousand,
respectively.

Changes in fair value 

Balance, June 30, 2024 

The
estimated fair values of the PIPE Notes and Yorkville Note are determined based on the aggregated, probability-weighted average of
the outcomes of certain possible scenarios. The combined value of the probability-weighted average of those outcomes is then
discounted back to each reporting period in which the convertible notes are outstanding, in each case, based on a risk-adjusted
discount rate estimated based on the implied discount rate. The discount rate was held constant over the valuation periods given the
fact pattern associated with the Company and the stage of development.

The
estimated fair value of the SEPA derivative liability was million, which was determined using a scenario-based valuation model based
on the aggregated amount of draws expected to be made over the 24-month commitment period. The derivative value of such draws was then
discounted back to each reporting period in which the put option was outstanding, in each case, based on a risk-adjusted discount rate
based on the implied discount rate.

arising from claims, assessments, litigation, fines, penalties, and other sources are recognized, if and when it is probable that a liability
has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. The Company was not subject to any material legal proceedings during the
six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023. 

Private
Placements

the prepaid advance in connection with the SEPA. The Yorkville Letter also asserted that the Company s failure to timely file its

Company
Overview 

OneMedNet
Corporation is a healthcare software company with solutions focused on digital medical image management, exchange, and sharing. The Company
was founded in Delaware on November 20, 2015. The Company has been solely focused on creating solutions that simplify digital medical
image management, exchange, and sharing. The Company has one wholly-owned subsidiary, OneMedNet Technologies (Canada) Inc., incorporated
on October 16, 2015 under the provisions of the Business Corporations Act of British Columbia whose functional currency is the Canadian

Business
Combination 

On
November 7, 2023, we held the closing of the Business Combination whereby Merger Sub merged with and into Legacy ONMD, with Legacy ONMD
continuing as the surviving entity, which resulted in all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Legacy ONMD being exchanged
for shares of Common Stock upon the terms set forth in the agreement and plan of merger, dated April 25, 2022 (the Merger Agreement ),
by and among Data Knights, Merger Sub, Legacy ONMD, Data Knights, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the Sponsor ),
and Paul Casey, in his capacity as representative of the stockholders of Legacy ONMD. The Business Combination and other transactions
that closed on November 7, 2023, pursuant to the Merger Agreement, led to Data Knights changing its name to OneMedNet Corporation 
and the business of the Company became the business of Legacy ONMD. 

Pursuant
to the terms of the Merger Agreement, the total consideration for the Business Combination and related transactions (the Merger
Consideration was approximately 200 million. In connection with the special meeting of stockholders of Data Knights, certain
public holders holding 1,600,741 shares of Data Knights common stock exercised their right to redeem such shares for a pro rata portion
of the funds held by Continental Stock Transfer Trust Company, as trustee in the trust account established in connection with Data
Knights initial public offering. Effective November 7, 2023, Data Knights units ceased trading, and effective November
8, 2023, the Common Stock began trading on the Nasdaq Global Market under the symbol ONMD and the Public Warrants began
trading on the Nasdaq Global Market under the symbol ONMDW. The Common Stock and Public Warrants were transferred from
The Nasdaq Global Market to The Nasdaq Capital Market at the opening of business on August 19, 2024, and continue to trade under the
symbols ONMD and ONMDW, respectively. 

As
a result of the Business Combination, holders of Data Knights common stock automatically received Common Stock of OneMedNet, and holders
of Data Knights warrants automatically received warrants of OneMedNet with substantively identical terms. At the closing of the Business
Combination, all shares of Data Knights owned by the Sponsor (consisting of shares of Data Knights common stock and shares of Data Knights
Class B common stock), automatically converted into an equal number of shares of OneMedNet s Common Stock, and the private placement
warrants held by the Sponsor automatically converted into warrants to purchase one share of OneMedNet Common Stock with substantively
identical terms.

Key
Components of Consolidated Statements of Operations 

Revenue 

The
Company generates revenue from two streams: (1) iRWD, which provides regulatory grade imaging and clinical data in the pharmaceutical,
device manufacturing, contract research organizations, and AI markets and (2) BEAM, which is a medical imaging exchange platform between
hospital/healthcare systems, imaging centers, physicians and patients. iRWD is sold on a fixed fee basis based on the number of data
units and the cost per data unit committed to in the customer contract. Revenue is recognized when the data is delivered to the customer.
BEAM revenue is subscription-based revenue that is recognized ratably over the subscription period committed to by the customer. The
Company invoices its BEAM customers quarterly or annually in advance with the customer contracts automatically renewing unless the customer
issues a cancellation notice. 

The
Company excludes from revenue taxes collected from a customer that are assessed by a governmental authority and imposed on and concurrent
with a specific revenue-producing transaction. The transaction price for the products is the invoiced amount. Advanced billings from
contracts are deferred and recognized as revenue when earned. Deferred revenue consists of payments received in advance of performance
under the contract. Such amounts are generally recognized as revenue over the contractual period. The Company receives payments from
customers based upon contractual billing schedules. Accounts receivable is recorded when the right to consideration becomes unconditional.
Payment terms on invoiced amounts typically range from zero to 90 days, with typical terms of 30 days. 

Cost
of Revenue 

Our
cost of revenue is composed of our distinct performance obligations of hosting, labor, and data cost. 

General
and Administrative 

General
and administrative functions include finance, legal, human resources, operations, and information technology support. These functions
include costs for items such as salaries and benefits and other personnel-related costs, maintenance and supplies, professional fees
for external legal, accounting, and other consulting services, and depreciation expense. 

Research
and Development 

Costs
incurred in the research and development of our products are expensed as incurred. Research and development costs include personnel,
contracted services, materials, and indirect costs involved in the design and development of new products and services, as well as hosting
expense. 

Sales
and Marketing 

Our
sales and marketing costs consist of labor and tradeshow costs. 

Interest
Expense 

Interest
expense consists of interest incurred on shareholder loans. 

Other
(Income) Expenses, Net 

Other
(income) expenses, net, primarily includes the changes in fair value of convertible debt and change in fair value of PIPE Notes for
which we have elected the fair value option of accounting. Convertible notes payable, which include convertible promissory notes,
PIPE Notes issued to related parties and the Yorkville Note, including accrued interest and contingently issuable warrants, contain
embedded derivatives, including settlement of the contingent conversion features, which require bifurcation and separate accounting.
Accordingly, we have elected to measure the entire contingently convertible debt instruments, including accrued interest, at fair
value. These debt instruments were initially recorded at fair value as liabilities and are subsequently re-measured at fair value on
our condensed consolidated balance sheet at the end of each reporting period and at settlement, as applicable. Other income or
expenses, net, also includes changes in fair value of loan extensions, deferred underwriting fees and warrants which are treated as
liability instruments measured at fair value for accounting purposes, initially recorded at fair value and subsequently re-measured
to fair value on our condensed consolidated balance sheets at the end of each reporting period. The changes in the fair value of
these debt and liability instruments are recorded in changes in fair value, included as a component of other (income) expenses, net,
in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. 

At
the closing of the Business Combination, convertible promissory notes were converted into Common Stock immediately prior to the Closing
and were no longer outstanding as of the closing date. 

Other
(income) expenses, net, also includes foreign exchange and tax expenses related to the Company s operations and revenue outside
of the United States.

Our
revenue is comprised of sales made from our subscription revenue (BEAM) and from our web imaging (iRWD). For the three months ended
June 30, 2024, overall revenue increased by 31 compared to the prior year period. The primary driver for the subscription revenue
decrease was because of the planned discontinuation of this platform in 2025. As we move away from the BEAM platform to focus on
iRWD sales, we have stopped renewals for most of our customers leading to decreased revenue for the three months ended June 30,
2024. The primary driver for the web imaging revenue increase was due to our enhanced focus on iRWD sales leading to increased
customer deliveries during the three months ended June 30, 2024.

For
the three months ended June 30, 2024, our cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue increased by 12 compared to the prior year period. The increase is primarily
driven by lower subscription revenues and higher iRWD consulting costs as we transition away from the BEAM platform to focus on our
iRWD product. 

General
and Administrative 

Our
general and administrative expense increased 1.1 million, or 175 , to 1.7 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024 from
 0.6 million for the three months ended June 30, 2023. The increase is primarily due to an increase in professional fees of 0.7
million from being a public company (e.g. higher legal, audit and consulting fees), and a commitment fee of 0.5 million from the SEPA, which are partially offset by a decrease in stock compensation expense of 24 thousand and other miscellaneous
office expenses of 31 thousand. 

Sales
and Marketing 

Our
sales marketing expense decreased 58 thousand, or 19 , to 253 thousand for the three months ended June 30, 2024 from 311
thousand for the three months ended June 30, 2023. The decrease is primarily due to a decrease in salaries and benefits of 122
thousand and consulting fees of 26 thousand, which are partially offset by increases in trade shows of 56 thousand, dues and
subscriptions of 16 thousand, and software of 17 thousand. 

Research
and development 

Our
research and development expense decreased 0.2 million, or 34 , to 0.4 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024 from 0.6
million for the three months ended June 30, 2023. The decrease is primarily due to a decrease in stock compensation expense of 159
thousand, and professional fees of 61 thousand, which are partially offset by an increase in salaries and benefits of 30
thousand. 

Interest
Expense 

During
the three months ended June 30, 2024, interest expense was primarily comprised of interest expense on loans made from related parties
(Management and Directors) and interest expense on the remaining 0.5 million of deferred underwriter fees payable. During the three
months ended June 30, 2023, we did not incur any interest expense. 

Change

Change in Fair Value of Yorkville Note 

The change in fair value of Yorkville
Note during the three months ended June 30, 2024 was due to the Yorkville Note issued in June 2024 and the resulting fluctuations of the
market price of shares of Common Stock. 

Change in Fair Value of Derivative Liability 

The
change in fair value of derivative liability during the three months ended June 30, 2024 relates to the mark-to-market adjustment of
the SEPA put option derivative liability. 

Change
in Fair Value of Convertible Promissory Notes 

The
change in fair value of convertible promissory notes was due to the closing of the Business Combination
and the resulting fluctuations of the market price of shares of Common Stock . The Legacy ONMD Convertible Promissory Notes were
converted at the closing of the Business Combination and were no longer outstanding during the three months ended June 30, 2024. 

Stock
Warrant Expense 

Stock
warrant expense during the three months ended June 30, 2024 was due to the Helena Termination Warrants, which was considered a cost to
terminate the Helena SPA . 

Stock
warrant expense during the three months ended June 30, 2023 was due to the Convertible Promissory Notes Warrants, which was most accurately
portrayed as an issuance cost related to the Convertible Promissory Notes .

Our revenue is comprised of sales made from our subscription revenue (BEAM)
and from our web imaging (iRWD). For the six months ended June 30, 2024, overall revenue increased by 34 . The primary driver for the
immaterial change in subscription revenue was because of the planned discontinuation of this platform in 2025. As we move away from the
BEAM platform to focus on iRWD sales, we have stopped renewals for most of our customers leading to an immaterial increase for the six
months ended June 30, 2024. The primary driver for the web imaging revenue increase was due to our enhanced focus on iRWD sales leading
to increased customer deliveries during the six months ended June 30, 2024.

For the six months ended June 30, 2024, our cost of revenue as a percentage
of revenue decreased by 10 . The decrease is primarily driven by significant sales growth for our iRWD product, coupled with stable BEAM
revenue prior to our planned discontinuation of the platform in 2025. The overall increase in cost of revenue is primarily due to an increase
in salaries and benefits, software costs and iRWD consulting and data costs. 

General
and Administrative 

Our
general and administrative expense increased 1.9 million, or 164 , to 3.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024 from 1.2
million for the six months ended June 30, 2023. The increase is primarily due to an increase in professional fees of 1.3 million
from being a public company (e.g. higher legal, audit and consulting fees), a commitment fee of 0.5 million from the SEPA, salaries and benefits of 0.1 million, and
bad debt expense of 0.1 million, which are partially offset by a decrease in other miscellaneous office expenses of 0.1
million. 

Sales
and Marketing 

Our
sales marketing expense decreased 88 thousand, or 15 , to 483 thousand for the six months ended June 30, 2024 from 571 thousand
for the six months ended June 30, 2023. The decrease is primarily due to a decrease in salaries and benefits of 206 thousand and consulting
expense of 14 thousand, which are partially offset by increases in trade shows of 83 thousand, dues and subscriptions of 31 thousand,
and software of 15 thousand. 

Research
and development 

Our
research and development expense decreased 0.3 million, or 29 , to 0.8 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024 from 1.2 million
for the six months ended June 30, 2023. The decrease is primarily due to a decrease in stock compensation expense of 0.4 million, which
is partially offset by an increase in salaries and benefits of 0.1 million. 

Interest
Expense 

During
the six months ended June 30, 2024, interest expense was primarily comprised of interest expense on loans made from related parties (Management
and Directors) and interest expense on the remaining 0.5 million of deferred underwriter fees payable. During the six months ended June
30, 2023, we did not incur any interest expense.

Non-GAAP
Financial Measure 

In
addition to providing financial measurements based on U.S. GAAP, we provide an additional financial metric that is not prepared in accordance
with U.S. GAAP (a non-GAAP financial measure ). We use this non-GAAP financial measure, in addition to U.S. GAAP financial
measures, to understand and compare operating results across accounting periods, for financial and operational decision making, for planning
and forecasting purposes, to measure executive compensation, and to evaluate our financial performance. This non-GAAP financial measure
is Adjusted EBITDA, as discussed below. 

We
believe that this non-GAAP financial measure reflects our ongoing business in a manner that allows for meaningful comparisons and analysis
of trends in the business, as it facilitates comparing financial results across accounting periods and to those of peer companies. We
also believe that this non-GAAP financial measure enables investors to evaluate our operating results and future prospects in the same
manner as we do. This non-GAAP financial measure may exclude expenses and gains that may be unusual in nature, infrequent, or not reflective
of our ongoing operating results. 

This
non-GAAP financial measure should not be viewed as a substitute for a U.S. GAAP financial measure and may be different from a similarly
titled non-GAAP financial measure used by other companies. Furthermore, there are limitations inherent in the non-GAAP financial measure
because it excludes charges and credits that are required to be included in a U.S. GAAP presentation. Accordingly, the non-GAAP financial
measure does not replace the presentation of our U.S. GAAP financial measures and should only be used as a supplement to, not as a substitute
for, our financial results presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. U.S. GAAP net loss is the closest comparable U.S. GAAP measure used. 

We
consider Adjusted EBITDA to be an important indicator of the operational strength and performance of our business and a good measure
of our historical operating trends. Adjusted EBITDA eliminates items that we do not consider to be part of our core operations. We
define Adjusted EBITDA as U.S. GAAP net loss excluding the following items: interest expense; income tax expense; depreciation and
amortization of tangible assets; stock-based compensation; Business Combination transaction expenses; and other non-recurring items
that may arise from time to time. 

The
non-GAAP adjustments, and our basis for excluding them from our non-GAAP financial measure, are outlined below: 

Adjusted
 EBITDA does not reflect interest expense or the cash requirements necessary to service payments on our shareholder loans, which is
 not a core form of financing for our business; 

Adjusted
 EBITDA does not reflect income tax expense, which relates to our foreign subsidiary, because we have suffered recurring consolidated
 operating losses since inception and expect that to continue in the future; 

Although
 depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets that we currently depreciate and amortize will likely have to be replaced
 in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the cash required to fund such replacements; 

Adjusted
 EBITDA excludes stock-based compensation expense which has been, and will continue to be for the foreseeable future, a significant
 recurring non-cash expense for our business and an important part of our compensation strategy; 

Adjusted
 EBITDA does not reflect the effect of earnings or charges resulting from matters that our management does not consider to be indicative
 of our ongoing operations. However, some of these charges and gains (such as mark-to-market adjustments, stock warrant expense, etc.)
 have recurred and may recur; and 

Other
 companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently, which reduces its usefulness as a comparative
 measure.

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

As
of June 30, 2024, our principal sources of liquidity were proceeds from related party investors and our revolving line of credit and
cash received from customers. 

The
following table shows net cash and cash equivalents used in operating activities, net cash and cash equivalents used in investing activities,
and net cash and cash equivalents provided by financing activities during the periods presented:

Operating
Activities 

Our
net cash and cash equivalents used in operating activities consists of net loss adjusted for certain non-cash items, including depreciation
and amortization, stock-based compensation expense, changes in fair value of liability classified financial instruments, and as well
as changes in operating assets and liabilities. The primary changes in working capital items, such as the changes in accounts receivable
and deferred revenue, result from the difference in timing of payments from our customers related to contract performance obligations.
This may result in an operating cash flow source or use for the period, depending on the timing of payments received as compared to the
fulfillment of the performance obligation. 

Net cash used in operating activities was 3.1 million during the six months
ended June 30, 2024. Net cash used in operating activities was due to our net loss of 5.7 million, which is offset by non-cash items
of 1.4 million, primarily consisting of stock-based compensation of 0.2 million, change in fair value of Yorkville Note of 0.8 million,
change in fair value of derivative liability of 0.2 million, non-cash interest expense of 0.1 million, and cash from operating assets
and liabilities of 1.3 million due to the timing of cash payments to vendors and cash receipts from customers. 

By
comparison, the Company s net cash used in operating activities was 2.0 million during the six months ended June 30, 2023. Net
cash used in operating activities for the six months ended June 30, 2023 was due to our net loss of 17.4 million, which is offset by
non-cash items of 15.0 million, primarily consisting of the change in fair value of convertible debt of 10.3 million, stock warrant
expense of 4.1 million and stock-based compensation expense of 0.6 million, and cash from operating assets and liabilities of 0.5
million due to the timing of cash payments to vendors and cash receipts from customers. 

23 

Investing
Activities 

Our
investing activities have consisted primarily of property and equipment purchases. 

Net
cash and cash equivalents used in investing activities during the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023 consisted of 7 thousand of
purchased property and equipment. 

Financing
Activities 

Net
cash provided by financing activities was 3.7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024, which primarily consisted of 1.9 million
of proceeds received from related party loans, 1.4 million of proceeds received from the issuance of Yorkville Note, and
 0.5 million of proceeds from our revolving line of credit. 

By
comparison, the Company s net cash provided by financing activities was 2.0 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023,
which primarily consisted of 2.1 million of proceeds from the issuance of convertible promissory notes, and 0.6 million of
proceeds received from related party loans, offset by 0.7 million of Business Combination costs paid. 

Contractual
Obligations and Commitments and Going Concern Outlook 

Currently,
management does not believe that our cash and cash equivalents is sufficient to meet our foreseeable cash needs for at least the next
12 months. Our foreseeable cash needs, in addition to our recurring operating expenses, include our expected capital expenditures to
support the expansion of our infrastructure and workforce, interest expense and minimum contractual obligations. Management intends to
raise cash for operations through debt and equity offerings. As a result of the Company s recurring loss from operations and the
need for additional financing to fund its operating and capital requirements there is uncertainty regarding the Company s ability
to maintain liquidity sufficient to operate its business effectively, which raises substantial doubt as to the Company s ability
to continue as a going concern. 

Our
future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our growth rate, the timing and extent of spending to support research
and development efforts, the expansion of sales and marketing activities, the introduction of new and enhanced product and service offerings,
and the cost of any future acquisitions of technology or businesses. In the event that additional financing is required from outside
sources, we may be unable to raise the funds on acceptable terms, if at all.

Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates 

Our
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our condensed consolidated financial
statements which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. In preparing our financial statements, we make estimates, assumptions, and
judgments that can have a significant impact on our reported revenue, results of operations, and net income or loss, as well as on the
value of certain assets and liabilities on our balance sheet during and as of the reporting periods. These estimates, assumptions, and
judgments are necessary because future events and their effects on our results of operations and the value of our assets cannot be determined
with certainty and are made based on our historical experience and on other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances.
These estimates may change as new events occur or additional information is obtained, and we may periodically be faced with uncertainties,
the outcomes of which are not within our control and may not be known for a prolonged period of time. Because the use of estimates is
inherent in the financial reporting process, actual results could differ from those estimates. 

24 

For
a discussion of our critical accounting estimates, see Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
of Operations in the Form 10-K/A, the notes to our audited financial statements appearing in the Form 10-K/A, and the notes to
the financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Report. There have been no material changes to these critical accounting policies
and estimates through June 30, 2024 from those discussed in the Form 10-K/A. 

Recently
Issued and Adopted Accounting Pronouncements 

A
description of recently issued accounting pronouncements that may potentially impact our financial position and results of operations
is disclosed in Note 2 to our condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Report. 

Item

We
are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information required
under this item. 

Item
4. Controls and Procedures 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Our
management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the
design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange
Act), as of June 30, 2024. Based on such evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that as of
June 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective because of material weaknesses in our internal controls over
financial reporting which were not designed properly to ensure proper identification of non-routine transactions and ensure appropriate
segregation of duties. 

Material
Weakness 

As
disclosed elsewhere in this Report, we completed the Business Combination on November 7, 2023. Prior to the Business Combination, Data
Knights, our predecessor, was a special purpose acquisition company formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange,
asset acquisition, stock purchase, recapitalization or similar business combination with one or more businesses. As a result, previously
existing internal controls are no longer applicable or comprehensive enough as of the assessment date, because Data Knights operations
prior to the Business Combination were insignificant compared to those of the consolidated entity post-Business Combination. As a result,
management is aware of material weaknesses in the Company s internal control related to user access/segregation of duties, lack
of a formalized control environment and oversight of controls over financial reporting, errors in accounting for non-routine transactions,
and lack of record keeping. Due to the limited transactional volume currently experienced combined with our financial limitations, we
do not currently have an expanded accounting department that would allow us to better segregate duties. Over time, as we continue to
grow and add accounting staff, we expect to continue to enhance our internal control structure, including appropriate segregation of
duties. During September 2024, changes were made to accounting personnel to enhance our financial reporting structure, which we expect
to alleviate reporting pressures, including reporting of non-routine transactions. In addition, the new personnel has focused on creating
central filing repositories to manage accounting records and other company documents. 

Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

There
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the three months ended June 30, 2024 that have materially affected,
or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
