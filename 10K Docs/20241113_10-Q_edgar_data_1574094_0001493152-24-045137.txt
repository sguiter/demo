 Notes
to the Unaudited Condensed Interim Financial Statements 

million, primarily from private placements of convertible preferred stock, convertible debt securities, the issuance of securities
in the Company s August 2021 initial public offering (the IPO ), the sale of common stock and common stock
warrants and the exercise of common stock warrants and common stock options. After deducting underwriting discounts and commissions,
placement agent fees and other offering expenses, the Company s net offerings were million. As of September 30, 2024,
the Company had cash and cash equivalents of 
million. As used herein, the term common stock refers to the Company s common stock, par value 
per share. 

The
Company is in the pre-commercial stage and therefore has incurred significant losses and negative cash flows from operations since its
inception. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company reported a net loss of million and an accumulated deficit of
 million and does not expect to generate positive cash flows from operations in the foreseeable future. The Company expects to incur
significant and increasing losses until regulatory approval is granted for its first product candidate, RenovoGem . Regulatory
approval is not guaranteed and may never be obtained. The Company may also pursue other revenue-generating strategies such as licensing
or collaboration agreements or marketing its proprietary catheter device on a standalone basis .
No assurances can be made that the Company will pursue these strategies, and even if it does, there is a risk that the Company will be
unable to generate revenue from such activities. 

The
Company believes it will be able to raise additional required capital through debt financings, private or public equity financings, license
agreements, collaborative agreements or other arrangements with other companies, or other sources of financing. There can be no assurance
that such financing will be available or will be at terms acceptable to the Company. The inability to raise capital as and when needed
would have a negative impact on the Company s liquidity, financial condition and its ability to pursue its business strategy. The
Company will need to generate significant revenue to achieve profitability, and it may never do so. 

On
November 10, 2022, the Company filed an omnibus shelf registration statement on Form S-3 that provides for the aggregate offerings
of up to million of the Company s securities subject to various limitations, including limited sales in any twelve-month
period while the Company is subject to the baby-shelf rules. As of September 30, 2024, and subject to the baby-shelf limitations
rules, the aggregate offerings would be up to million. The Company has also filed a registration statement on Form S-1 to register
the cash exercise of the Company s outstanding IPO, underwriter and private warrants. Cash exercise of these outstanding warrants
is only expected to occur (if at all) when the trading price of the common stock is in excess of the per share exercise price
of such outstanding warrants. 

On
April 3, 2023, the Company completed a registered direct offering RDO utilizing its shelf registration statement for
the purchase and sale of shares of common stock (or pre-funded common stock warrants) to a certain institutional investor.
In a concurrent private placement, the Company issued to the investor unregistered common warrants to purchase up to shares
of common stock (the April 2023 Warrant ). The
aggregate gross proceeds from this offer were million, and the net offering proceeds were million after deducting placement
agent fees and placement agent s expenses of million and other professional expenses of million. 

On
January 26, 2024, the Company completed a private placement to accredited investors with gross proceeds of million before deducting
placement agent fees and other offering expenses of approximately million. In this private placement, the Company issued 
shares of its common stock and common warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of shares of common stock, which expire from the issuance date, January 26, 2024. In connection with such private placement, the Company entered into a placement agent
agreement as additional compensation to the placement agent, and issued common warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of shares
of common stock (the January 2024 PA Warrants ), which warrants expire from the issuance date. The significant majority of the warrants issued in this private placement have an exercise price of per share. The warrants purchased
by directors, officers, employees and consultants of the Company in this private placement have an exercise price of per share. 

On
April 11, 2024, the Company completed another private placement offering to accredited investors, issuing common stock, pre-funded
warrants, Series A warrants, and Series B warrants. The aggregate gross proceeds from this offer were million, and the net offering
proceeds were million after deducting placement agent fees of million and other professional expenses of million. In conjunction
with the issuance of shares of common stock, the Company bundled the offering with: (i) a pre-funded warrant exercisable for
 shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share, with an unlimited term and immediate exercisability upon issuance,
subject to specific beneficial ownership limitations; (ii) Series A warrants exercisable for shares of common stock at 
per share, valid for years and immediately exercisable subject to customary adjustments and beneficial ownership limitations; (iii)
Series B warrants exercisable for shares of common stock at per share, valid for years and immediately exercisable
subject to customary adjustments and beneficial ownership limitations, with the Company retaining the right to call these warrants under
certain conditions. Additionally, as compensation to the placement agent, the Company issued warrants on the same date, to purchase up
to an aggregate of shares of common stock (the April 2024 PA Warrants at per share over a -year term, with
provisions for cashless exercise if the shares are unregistered or no current prospectus is available for resale. The April 2024 PA Warrants
become exercisable on October 11, 2024, subject to specific beneficial ownership limitations and customary adjustments. 

The
accompanying condensed interim financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern
and has reviewed the relevant conditions and events surrounding its ability to continue as a going concern including among others:
historical losses, projected future results, negative cash flows from operations, including cash requirements for the upcoming year,
funding capacity, net working capital, total stockholders equity and future access to capital. Based upon this review and the
Company s current financial condition and operating plans, the Company has concluded that these conditions raise substantial
doubt regarding its ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least one year from the date of issuance of these
condensed interim financial statements. 

As a result, the Company will require additional funding to support its continuing operations. Until such time, if
ever, as the Company can generate product revenue through its commercialization strategy, the Company expects to finance its cash needs
through private or public equity financings, debt financings and collaborations, licenses or other similar arrangements. The Company continues
to attract potential investors on the novel approach of its TAMP therapy platform. 

shares of the Company s common stock (the
 CMO Warrant as a performance incentive for the Company s RenovoCath contract manufacturing organization, CMO ).
The CMO Warrant vests and only becomes exercisable over time in tranches, and only if the CMO achieves certain manufacturing milestones.
The Company evaluated the CMO Warrant in accordance with ASC 718, Compensation Stock Compensation, and concluded the CMO Warrant
constitutes share-based payments for goods used in the Company s operations and the CMO Warrant is equity-classified, as it lacks
characteristics that would require liability treatment, such as cash settlement provisions or obligations to repurchase shares. The fair
value of the CMO Warrant will be measured using the Black-Scholes model, with grant date fair value determined by the award terms. As
the CMO Warrant is an incentive under the Company s commercial strategy for its RenovoCath device, the fair value of the CMO Warrant
will be considered as part of the costs to produce the device as inventory and subsequently recognized as cost of sales upon the sale
of associated goods. For the EPS treatment, management concluded that the CMO Warrant constitutes contingently issuable potential common
shares. When shares are issued upon exercise of the CMO Warrant, the Company will assess dilutive effects per ASC 260, Earnings Per Share.
Following ASC 260-10-45-22, the treasury stock method will apply, assuming warrant exercise at the start of each period (or issuance
if later), and calculating incremental shares based on proceeds hypothetically used to repurchase shares at the average market price.
Since the holder of the CMO Warrant does not participate in dividends with common stock pre-exercise, the shares of common stock underlying
the CMO Warrant does not affect basic EPS until exercised.

There
were no transfers between Level 1, Level 2 or Level 3 during the periods presented. The Company had no other financial assets or liabilities
that were required to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis. 

Assumptions
Used in Determining Fair Value of Warrant 

The
terms of the April 2023 Warrant provide that in the event of certain fundamental transactions
involving the Company, the warrant holder may require the Company to make a payment based on a Black-Scholes valuation of the April
2023 Warrant , using specified inputs. Therefore, the April 2023 Warrants are accounted
for as liabilities. 

The
Company recorded the fair value of the April 2023 Warrant using the Monte Carlo simulation
model. It is also required to revalue the April 2023 Warrant at each reporting date, with
any changes in fair value recorded on the Company s statement of operations. The valuation of the April
2023 Warrant is considered under Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy and influenced by the fair value of the underlying common
stock.

30, 2024, and 2023, the Company had a net operating loss NOL for each period that generated deferred tax assets for NOL
carryforwards. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for temporary differences between the financial statements and
income tax carrying values using tax rates in effect for the years such differences are expected to reverse. Due to uncertainties surrounding
our ability to generate future taxable income and consequently realize such deferred income tax assets, the Company has determined that
it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will not be realized. Accordingly, the Company has established a full valuation
allowance against its deferred tax assets as of September 30, 2024. 

The
Company s policy is to recognize any interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense.

Item
2: Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

Unless
the context otherwise requires, all references in this section to the Company, we, us, or our 
refer to RenovoRx, Inc. You should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations in
conjunction with our unaudited interim condensed financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Report, our management s
discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2023, which is included in our
2023 Annual Report. 

This
discussion contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act and Section 21E of the Exchange
Act that reflect our plans, estimates, and beliefs that involve risks and uncertainties, including those described in the section of
this Report titled Cautionary Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements. Our actual results and the timing of selected
events could differ materially from those discussed below. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are
not limited to, those identified below and those set forth under the section titled Risk Factors included elsewhere in
this Report and in the 2023 Annual Report. 

Overview 

We
are a life sciences company developing novel targeted oncology therapies and offering RenovoCath ,
 a novel, U.S. Food and Drug Administration FDA )-cleared local drug-delivery platform, targeting high unmet medical
needs. Our patented TAMP therapy platform is designed to ensure precise therapeutic delivery
across the arterial wall near the tumor site to bathe the target tumor, while potentially minimizing a therapy s toxicities versus
systemic intravenous therapy. Our novel approach to targeted treatment offers the potential for increased safety, tolerance, and improved
efficacy, and our mission is to transform the lives of cancer patients by providing innovative solutions to enable targeted delivery
of diagnostic and therapeutic agents. 

Our lead product candidate is a novel oncology
drug-device combination product and is being investigated under a U.S. Investigational New Drug IND application that
is regulated by the FDA s 21 CFR 312 pathway. The investigational drug-device combination candidate utilizes RenovoCath ,
our FDA-cleared device, indicated for temporary vessel occlusion in applications including arteriography, preoperative occlusion, and
chemotherapeutic drug infusion. 

The intra-arterial infusion of the chemotherapy , gemcitabine , utilizing RenovoCath is currently being evaluated
for the treatment of locally advanced pancreatic cancer LAPC by the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (the drug
division of FDA) in our ongoing Phase III TIGeR-PaC randomized multi-center clinical trial. 

We
may also evaluate RenovoCath with gemcitabine as a potential therapy in other indications. RenovoCath with gemcitabine received Orphan
Drug Designation for pancreatic cancer and bile duct cancer, which provides 7 years of market exclusivity upon NDA approval by the FDA. 

Further,
as described further below under Other Potential Opportunities for RenovoCath, we are also actively exploring other commercialization
strategies utilizing our TAMP technology and FDA-cleared RenovoCath delivery system as a stand-alone device. 

14 

Intra-arterial
Infusion of Gemcitabine with RenovoCath: Clinical Process to Date 

Systemic
(IV gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel) chemotherapy is currently the standard of care for pancreatic cancer treatment. However, it is known
to cause debilitating side effects for patients diagnosed with this disease. Unlike other tumors with extensive blood supply, pancreatic
tumors have poor blood supply so systemic chemotherapy may not adequately reach the tumor. Thus, the standard of care may be less effective
in treating this type of cancer because the blood vessels are critical for transporting systemic administration of chemotherapy to the
tumor. 

We
have completed our RR1 Phase I/I and RR2 observational registry studies for RenovoCath with gemcitabine, with 20 and 25 patients respectively,
in LAPC. In the 35 pooled patients evaluable in these two studies, 9 patients pretreated with radiation followed by treatment with RenovoCath
with gemcitabine experienced a median Overall Survival OS of 27.1 months. Based on previous large randomized clinical
trials, the expected survival of LAPC patients is 12.0 to 18.8 months in patients receiving only IV systemic chemotherapy or IV chemotherapy
plus radiation (which are both considered standard of care). Unlike the randomized trials that established these standard of care results,
our RR1 and RR2 clinical trials did not prospectively control the standard of care therapy received prior to administration of RenovoCath
with gemcitabine. Based on FDA safety review of our Phase I/II study, the FDA allowed us to proceed to evaluate RenovoCath with gemcitabine
within our Phase III TIGeR-PaC clinical trial. 

Our ongoing
Phase III TIGeR-PaC clinical trial, a randomized, multi-center study, is evaluating RenovoRx s
first product candidate, using TAMP , a novel investigational oncology drug-device
combination utilizing the Company s FDA-cleared RenovoCath device for the intra-arterial administration of gemcitabine to
treat LAPC following stereotactic body radiation therapy SBRT ). The study compares the treatment of LAPC using
RenovoCath with gemcitabine versus systemic IV administration of gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel. 

Our
protocol for TIGeR-PaC involves systemic chemotherapy and SBRT during the induction phase of the study (prior to randomization).
Patients receiving SBRT during the induction phase are required to complete 5 treatments, over 5 consecutive days, and do not
receive oral chemotherapy vs. previously utilized intensity-modulated radiation therapy IMRT where patients must
complete 25 radiation treatments in combination with oral chemotherapy during the induction phase of the study, which takes between
35 and 56 days to complete. In December 2021, we amended our protocol and statistical analysis plan for TIGeR-PaC (the
 Modified SAP to (i) enroll and analyze only patients receiving SBRT during the induction phase, (ii) include a second
interim analysis, (iii) change the total number of patients randomized in the study to 114 with a total of 86 deaths from SBRT
patients, and (iv) repower the study from 90 to 80 ,The change to the 80 power calculation aligns with common practice for
clinical trials and, we believe this design will shorten the timeframe needed to complete the study, as well as significantly
decrease our costs. We have not discussed the protocol
amendment or the Modified SAP with the FDA, and we cannot provide any assurance that the FDA will agree with these modifications,
but these modifications have been submitted to the FDA. 

The
first interim analysis in the TIGeR-PaC study at the 26 th event of the specified events (deaths), was completed in March 2023,
with the Data Monitoring Committee recommending a continuation of the study. The TIGeR-PaC study s primary endpoint is an OS benefit
with secondary endpoints including reduced side effects versus standard of care. The second interim analysis for this study will be triggered
by the 52 nd event, which is estimated to occur in late 2024 or early 2025. The second interim data readout would follow thereafter,
with the timing for such readout depending on customary factors such as
time needed for analysis. We are also aiming to complete patient
enrollment in the TIGeR-PaC study in the first half of 2025. 

Our
TAMP Therapy Platform 

Our patented TAMP therapy platform is focused on optimizing drug concentration in solid tumors by delivering oncology
therapies with our RenovoCath delivery system. TAMP is designed to enable physicians to isolate segments of the vascular anatomy closest to tumors and
ensure precise therapeutic delivery, while potentially minimizing a therapy s toxicities versus systemic intravenous therapy.
Specifically, our patented approach enables physicians to pre-treat patients with standard-of-care radiation therapy and utilize our
RenovoCath delivery system to use pressure to force chemotherapy across the arterial wall near the tumor site to bathe the target
tumor. 

15 

We
believe there are many advantages to our TAMP therapy platform, including: 

Application
 of Approved Chemotherapeutic Agents : Approved chemotherapeutic agents, with well-known safety and efficacy profiles have been
 used with our RenovoCath delivery system. These include small molecule chemotherapy agents, and based on more recent animal studies,
 we believe that larger molecule agents could be utilized as well. 

Targeted Approach :
 In a preclinical study using our therapy platform, we demonstrated up to 100 times higher local drug concentration compared to systemic
 chemotherapy. We believe our TAMP therapy platform allows for a targeted approach that can decrease systemic exposure and improve
 patient outcomes. 

Delivery
 Method Independent of Tumor Vascularity : Our therapy platform is designed to deliver chemotherapeutic agents to solid tumors
 resistant to systemic chemotherapy due to lack of tumor feeder blood vessels. If approved, our product candidates utilizing our
 FDA-cleared RenovoCath delivery system have the potential to treat tumors
 that are not directly supplied by large blood vessels. 

Broad Application for
 Solid Tumor Indications : Our therapy platform is not restricted to a single chemotherapeutic agent or solid tumor type. As such,
 it may be applied for use with additional therapeutic agents and/or in additional solid tumor indications, including in solid tumors
 with and without identifiable tumor feeder blood vessels. 

We
received our first FDA 510(k) clearance for RenovoCath in 2014, a second clearance to use the RenovoCath for infusion of chemotherapy
agents in 2017, a further clearance to use RenovoCath with a power-injector in 2019, and a fourth clearance in 2021 to expand vessel
diameter range to 3-11 mm, implement certain changes in the Instructions for Use, change the recommended saline to contrast solution
ratio, among other changes and improvements. 

In
a further validation of our TAMP platform, last year, we announced a collaboration with Imugene (ASX:
IMU) to explore expansion of our TAMP product pipeline with Imugene s CF33 oncolytic virus therapy for the treatment of
difficult-to-access tumors. We are continually in discussions regarding similar collaborations and potentially out-licenses of RenovoCath
with gemcitabine as we prepare for the NDA filing (assuming we meet our study endpoints) and commercialization of RenovoCath (if approved
by FDA) as well as other collaborations with our TAMP platform. 

For further information regarding our RenovoCath Instructions for Use IFU ),
please see: IFU-10004-Rev.-F-Universal-IFU.pdf . 

Other
Potential Commercial Opportunities for RenovoCath 

In
recent years, we have focused our efforts primarily on progressing RenovoCath with gemcitabine through our ongoing Phase III TIGeR-PaC
study for LAPC. During this process, we have begun to explore other opportunities for our TAMP therapy platform. 

As
a result of the introduction of our FDA-cleared RenovoCath delivery system as part of the TIGeR-PaC study and the resulting unsolicited
(and subsequently solicited) feedback we have received from oncologists, surgeons, and interventional radiologists indicating increased
demand for targeted delivery of diagnostic and/or therapeutic agents, during the first half of 2024, we began to actively explore a new
opportunity to market and sell RenovoCath as a standalone device. RenovoCath is FDA-cleared and indicated for temporary vessel occlusion
in applications including arteriography, preoperative occlusion, and chemotherapeutic drug infusion. We will engage in this potential
revenue-generating activity either on our own or, more likely, in tandem with a commercial partner. 

16 

In
September 2024, we announced the signing of a new project work order with our RenovoCath contract manufacturing organization
partner, Medical Murray Inc. of North Barrington, IL (the CMO ), for an expanded relationship as we continue our
exploration of commercial opportunities for RenovoCath beyond our currently ongoing clinical programs. To create performance
incentives for our CMO, we have issued a warrant to purchase up to 709,500 shares of our common stock. This warrant vests and is
only exercisable over time in tranches and only if the CMO achieves certain manufacturing milestones. 

Beyond
LAPC, we believe there are many clinical applications for RenovoCath to improve targeted delivery of diagnostic and therapeutic
agents. This leads us to a business development opportunity that would also likely engage in Phase IV post-market
 registry clinical studies of the RenovoCath delivery system to gather additional data to support both our clinical and
commercial efforts. Securing the manufacturing capacity for this strategy with our CMO partner is a great first step. We are also in
active discussions with many interested customers to purchase supplies of RenovoCath as well as potential distribution
partners. 

We
are increasing production of
RenovoCath supplies through our CMO, and if we launch our commercial strategy as planned, we anticipate potential for near-term revenue in 2025 . 
Without incremental revenues from this commercial strategy, we maintain sufficient cash on hand to achieve both our next interim
read-out of our Phase III TIGeR-PaC study, which will be triggered by the 52nd event, estimated to occur in late 2024 or early 2025,
and fund our current efforts for our RenovoCath go to market activities. The second interim data readout would follow thereafter,
with the timing for such readout depending on customary factors such as
time needed for analysis. We are also aiming to complete
patient enrollment in the TIGeR-PaC study in the first half of 2025. 

In
parallel, we remain fully engaged and committed to the ongoing pivotal Phase III TIGeR-PaC clinical trial in LAPC. During 2024, we announced
that additional renowned clinical oncology sites are now participating in the study with the goal of accelerating patient enrollment.
We are progressing towards data, which could allow for a second interim readout in the trial and the potential filing of NDA with the
FDA for RenovoCath with gemcitabine as a drug-device treatment in LAPC. 

Previous
Fundraising and Anticipated Future Spending 

Since
our inception, we have devoted substantially all our efforts to developing our cancer therapy platform and product candidates, raising
capital and organizing and staffing our company. In January and April 2024, we raised additional funding in two private placements, offering
shares of common stock and warrants to purchase shares of common stock for aggregate gross proceeds of 17.2 million. As of September
30, 2024, we have received over 59.2 million in aggregate gross proceeds and have financed our operations primarily through issuance
of convertible preferred stock and convertible notes prior to our initial public offering, and securities issued in our August 2021 initial
public offering, a registered direct offering with a single institutional investor in April 2023 (the RDO ), common stock
purchase warrants, the aforementioned January and April 2024 private placements, and a loan pursuant to the Paycheck Protection Program
under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (the CARES Act ). After deducting underwriting discounts, commissions,
placement fees, legal fees, and other professional expenses of 5.8 million, our net offering proceeds to date are 53.4 million. 

We
have incurred significant operating losses and generated negative cash flows from operations since our inception. As of September
30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of 9.6 million. As of September 30, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of 47.3
million. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses, increasing operating losses and negative cash flows for the
foreseeable future. At the time we launch our commercial strategy, we anticipate to generate revenue from RenovoCath device sales
via either on our own or, more likely, in tandem with a commercial partner our direct channel and/or collaborations, licensing
arrangements or other strategic or commercial activities. Given economic and market conditions and the timing of regulatory approval, we expect that
our expenses will increase in connection with our ongoing research, development and potential commercialization activities,
particularly if and when we decide to: 

Advance
 clinical development of the TAMP therapy platform with the RenovoCath delivery system by
 continuing to enroll patients in our ongoing Phase III TIGeR-PaC clinical trial, and advancing our technology through preclinical and clinical pipeline indication opportunities; 

Hire additional research,
 development, engineering, and general and administrative personnel; 

Pursue collaborations,
 licensing arrangements or other strategic or commercial activities relating to our technology; 

Maintain, expand, enforce,
 defend, and protect our intellectual property portfolio; and 

Expand our operational,
 financial and management systems and increase personnel, including personnel to support our clinical development, manufacturing and
 commercialization efforts and our operations. 

17 

As
a result, we will require significant additional funding to support our continuing operations. If and when any of our product candidates
successfully complete development, we will incur substantial additional costs associated with establishing a sales, marketing, medical
affairs and distribution infrastructure to commercialize our products for which we may obtain marketing approval, regulatory filings,
marketing approval, and post-marketing requirements, in addition to other commercial costs. We cannot reasonably estimate these costs
at this time. 

Our
ability to obtain additional financing will be subject to a number of factors, including market conditions, fluctuations in interest
rates, our operating performance and investor sentiment. If we are unable to raise additional capital when required or on acceptable
terms, we may have to significantly delay, scale back or discontinue the development and/or commercialization of our product candidates,
restrict or cease our operations or obtain funds by entering into agreements on unfavorable terms. Failure to obtain additional capital
on acceptable terms, or at all, would result in a material and adverse impact on our operations. As a result, there is substantial doubt
about our ability to operate as a going concern. 

Our
financial statements as of September 30, 2024 have been prepared on a going concern basis and do not include any adjustments that may
result from the outcome of this uncertainty. Based on our operating plans, we do not expect that our current cash and cash equivalents
as of the date of this filing, will be sufficient to fund our operating, investing and financing cash flow needs, assuming our programs
advance as currently contemplated. 

Components
of Our Results of Operations 

Revenue 

Currently,
we have not generated any revenue from product sales of our patented RenovoCath device or as a result of our TIGeR-PaC clinical study
or any other clinical or sales efforts. If our development efforts for our current or future product candidates are successful and result
in marketing approval or collaboration or license agreements with third parties, we may generate revenue in the future from a combination
of product sales or payments from collaboration or license agreements. We may also pursue a strategy of commercializing our RenovoCath,
as a standalone device as a means of generating revenue. 

Operating
Expenses 

Research
and Development 

Research
and development expenses consist of costs related to the research and development of our platform technology. Clinical trial costs are
a significant component of research and development expenses and include costs associated with third-party contractors and consultants.
We outsource a substantial portion of our clinical trial activities, utilizing the service of third-party clinical trial sites and third-party
vendors to assist us with the execution of our clinical trials. In addition, we have FDA 510(k) clearance for our proprietary catheter
delivery device RenovoCath, which comprises part of the RenovoGem product. Accordingly, we are able to charge our clinical trial sites
for the RenovoCath delivery device. To date, payments from clinical trial sites in consideration for RenovoCath delivery devices have
been adequate to cover our direct manufacturing costs. Any payments we receive from clinical trial sites as consideration for use of
RenovoCath delivery devices offset a portion of our research and development expenses. We expect our research and development expenses
to increase for the foreseeable future as we continue the development of our product candidates and enroll subjects in our ongoing Phase
III clinical trial, initiate new clinical trials and pursue regulatory approval of our product candidates. It is difficult to predict
with any certainty the duration and costs of completing our current or future clinical trials of our product candidates or if, when or
to what extent we will achieve regulatory approval and generate revenue from the commercialization and sale of our product candidates.
The duration, costs and timing of clinical trials and other development of our product candidates will depend on a variety of factors,
including uncertainties in clinical trial enrollment, timing and extent of future clinical trials, development of new product candidates
and significant and changing government regulation. We may never succeed in achieving regulatory approval for any of our product candidates. 

18 

Our
research and development expenses include: 

expenses incurred under
 agreements with clinical trial sites, third-party vendors, and consultants that are involved in conducting our clinical trials; 

costs of acquiring and
 developing clinical trial materials; 

personnel costs, including
 salaries, benefits, bonuses, and stock-based compensation for employees engaged in preclinical and clinical research and development; 

costs related to compliance
 with regulatory requirements; 

third-party vendor costs
 related to manufacturing materials and testing of our RenovoCath catheter delivery device; 

costs related to preclinical
 studies and pilot testing; 

travel expenses; and 

allocated general and administrative
 expenses which includes facilities and other indirect administrative expenses to support research and development activities, including
 employees salaries and benefits. 

Research
and development costs are expensed as incurred. Costs for certain development activities, such as clinical trials and preclinical studies,
are recognized based on evaluation of progress to completion of specific tasks using data such as subject enrollment, clinical site activations
or information provided to us by third party vendors. 

General
and Administrative 

General
and administrative expenses consist of salaries, benefits, and stock-based compensation for personnel in executive, finance and administrative
functions, professional services and associated costs related to accounting, tax, audit, legal, intellectual property other matters,
consulting costs, conferences, travel, and allocated expenses for rent, insurance, and other general overhead costs. We expect to continue
to incur additional expenses as a result of operating as a public company, including costs to comply with the rules and regulations of
the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, and Nasdaq listing standards and increased expenses in the areas of insurance, professional
services and investor relations. As a result, we expect our general and administrative expenses to increase in the foreseeable future.
General and administrative expenses are expensed as incurred. 

Other
Income (Expenses), Net 

Interest
and Dividend Income (Expense), Net 

Interest
expense consists of financing interest for the Directors and Officers liability insurance premiums. 

Interest
income and dividend income are earned from cash deposited in our short-term marketable securities and money market accounts. 

Change
in Fair Value of Common Warrant Liability 

Change
in fair value of warrant liability represents the gain or loss reported from the change in the fair value of the warrant liability associated
with the April 2023 Warrant. The fair value per share of the April 2023 Warrant was 0.61 and 1.69 on September 30, 2024 and December
31, 2023, respectively. The decrease in the fair value was primarily due to the decrease in our stock price. 

19 

Income
Tax Expense 

We
account for income taxes using the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recorded
based on the estimated future tax effects of differences between the financial statement and income tax basis of existing assets and
liabilities. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recorded net and classified as noncurrent on the balance sheets. A valuation
allowance is provided against our deferred income tax assets when their realization is more likely than not. 

We
are subject to income taxes in the federal and state jurisdictions. Tax regulations within each jurisdiction are subject to the interpretation
of the related tax laws and regulations and require significant judgment to apply. In accordance with the authoritative guidance on accounting
for uncertainty in income taxes, we recognize tax liabilities for uncertain tax positions when it is more likely than not that a tax
position will not be sustained upon examination and settlement with various taxing authorities. Liabilities for uncertain tax positions
are measured based upon the largest amount of benefit that is more-likely-than-not (greater than 50 of being realized upon settlement.
Our policy is to recognize interest and/or penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense. 

On
March 27, 2020, the CARES Act was enacted. The CARES Act includes several significant provisions for corporations, including the usage
of net operating losses NOLs ), interest deductions and payroll benefits. Corporate taxpayers may carryback NOLs originating
during 2018 through 2020 for up to five years.

Research
and Development 

Research
and development expenses were approximately 1.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, remaining relatively flat
compared to the same period last year. Employee and related benefit costs increased 0.1 million including an increase of 0.1 million in
clinical conferences and trade shows activities. This increase was partially offset by lower regulatory and clinical consulting
costs and manufacturing for our proprietary catheter delivery device. We anticipate research and development expenses to increase as
we increase manufacturing costs for our device and continue advancing our Phase III clinical trial study throughout the remainder of
the year. 

20 

General
and Administrative 

General
and administrative expenses were approximately 1.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of approximately
 0.2 million compared to approximately 1.4 million for the same period last year. The decrease was primarily due to decreases of 0.2
million in professional and consulting fees, and legal fees, partially offset by an increase of 0.1 million in investor and public relations
costs. We anticipate general and administrative expenses increasing moderately throughout the remaining year as we progress our commercialization
activities for our RenovoCath device. 

Other
Income/(Expense), Net 

Other
income/(expense), net was approximately 0.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of approximately 1.2
million compared to approximately 1.6 million for the in the same period last year. The decrease was primarily due to a 1.3 million
change in the fair value of the common warrant liability offset by interest and dividend income of 0.1 million.

Research
and Development 

Research
and development expenses were approximately 4.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of approximately 0.5
million, compared to approximately 4.9 million for the prior year period. The decrease was primarily due lower costs of 0.6 million
on clinical, regulatory and clinical consulting costs from our ongoing Phase III clinical trial cost as we reduced expenses to conserve
our cash runway in the first quarter and a decrease of 0.1 million in clinical conferences and trade shows, partially offset by an increase
of 0.3 million in employee and related benefits costs. Our primary manufacturer company of our RenovoCath device commenced production
this year as we implemented our commercialization and sale of our product candidate s strategy. Allocated general and administrative
support costs for personnel, facility and office supply expenses decreased by 0.1 million compared to the same period last year. We
anticipate research and development expenses to increase as we progress our commercialization strategy, including our ongoing Phase III
clinical trial study throughout the remainder of the year. 

General
and Administrative 

General
and administrative expenses were approximately 3.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of approximately
 0.8 million compared to approximately 4.7 million for the prior year period. The decrease was primarily due to a 0.3 million reduction
in professional and consulting fees, a 0.1 million decrease in recruitment fees, a 0.2 million decrease in investor and public relations
costs, a 0.2 million decrease in directors and officers liability insurance expense and a 0.1 million decrease in legal
fees. The decrease was partially offset by lower allocated general and administration expenses to research and development of 0.1 million.
We anticipate general and administrative expenses to increase slightly throughout the remaining year as we progress with our commercialization
activities for our RenovoCath device. 

21 

Other
Income/(Expense), Net 

Other
income/(expense), net was approximately 2.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of approximately 0.2 million
compared to approximately 2.6 million for the prior year period. The decrease was primarily due to a 1.0 million change in the fair
value of the common warrant liability due to a decline in our common stock price during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 as compared
to September 30, 2024. The decrease was offset by a 0.2 million increase in interest and dividend income from an increase in cash and
cash equivalents related to the completion of two private placement financings completed earlier in the year and 0.6 million of transaction
costs allocated to common warrant liability in the previous period. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we incurred a net loss of 5.9 million. As of September 30, 2024, our accumulated deficit stood
at 47.3 million. We anticipate incurring further losses and increasing operating expenses in future periods. 

On
April 3, 2023, we completed a RDO under our shelf registration statement on Form S-3 for the purchase and sale of 1,557,632 shares of
common stock (or pre-funded common warrants) at a purchase price of 3.21 per share of common stock (or pre-funded warrants) to a certain
institutional investor. Additionally, in a concurrent private placement, we issued to the investor common warrants to purchase up to
1,947,040 shares of our common stock. The aggregate gross proceeds from this RDO were 5.0 million, and the net offering proceeds were
 4.4 million after deducting placement agent fees and placement agent s expenses of 0.4 million and other professional expenses
of 0.2 million. 

On
January 26, 2024, we completed a private placement to 92 accredited investors with gross proceeds of 6.1 million. The private placement
included issuing 6,133,414 shares of our common stock and common stock warrants to purchase 6,133,414 shares of common stock, which expire
five years from the date of issuance. In connection with the private placement, we entered into a placement agent agreement as additional
compensation to the placement agent, and issued common stock warrants to purchase 511,940 shares of common stock, which expire five years
from the issuance date. 

On
April 11, 2024, we completed a second private placement offering, issuing common stock, pre-funded warrants, Series A warrants, and Series
B warrants. The aggregate gross proceeds from this offer were 11.1 million, and the net offering proceeds were 9.7 million after deducting
placement agent fees of 1.2 million and other professional expenses of 0.2 million. In conjunction with the issuance of 6,960,864 shares
of common stock, we bundled the offering with: (i) a pre-funded warrant exercisable for 951,500 shares of common stock at an exercise
price of 0.0001 per share, with an unlimited term and immediate exercisability upon issuance, subject to specific beneficial ownership
limitations; (ii) Series A warrants exercisable for 7,912,364 shares of common stock at 1.22 per share, valid for 5 years and immediately
exercisable subject to customary adjustments and beneficial ownership limitations; (iii) Series B warrants exercisable for 3,956,182
shares of common stock at 1.22 per share, valid for 2 years and immediately exercisable subject to customary adjustments and beneficial
ownership limitations, with us retaining the right to call these warrants under certain conditions. Additionally, we issued the April
2024 PA Warrants on the same date, exercisable for 701,243 shares of common stock at 1.69 per share over a 5-year term, with provisions
for cashless exercise if the shares are unregistered or no current prospectus is available for resale. The April 2024 PA Warrants become
exercisable on October 11, 2024, subject to specific beneficial ownership limitations and customary adjustments. 

As
of September 30, 2024, we have received over 59.2 million in gross proceeds through various financial arrangements to include the issuance
of preferred stock, convertible debt, securities in our IPO, the RDO, private placements and various loans. After deducting underwriting
discounts, commissions, placement fees, legal fees, and other professional expenses of 5.8 million, our net offering proceeds from these
activities were 53.4 million. 

22 

Based
on our operational plans, we do not expect that our current cash and cash equivalents as of the date of this filing, will be sufficient
to fund our operating, investing and financing cash flow needs for at least the next twelve months, assuming our programs advance as
currently contemplated. Based upon this review and the Company s current financial condition, the Company has concluded that substantial
doubt exists as to the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. We believe we will continue to be able to raise additional
capital through debt financing, private or public equity financings, license agreements, obtain a credit facility or other loan or at-the-market
offering, collaborative agreements or other arrangements with other companies, or other sources of financing. 

Our
ability to obtain additional required financing will be subject to a number of factors, including market conditions, fluctuations in
interest rates, our operating performance and investor sentiment. However, there can be no assurances that such financing will be available
or will be at terms acceptable to us, or at all. If we are unable to raise capital when needed or on attractive terms, we would be forced
to delay, reduce or eliminate our clinical trials, discontinue the development and/or commercialization of our product candidates, restrict
or cease our operations or obtain funds by entering into agreements on unfavorable terms. If any of these events occur, our ability to
achieve our operational goals would be adversely affected. Our future capital requirements and the adequacy of available funds will depend
on many factors, including those described in the section titled Risk Factors in Part I item 1A on Form 10-K on our 2023 Annual
Report. Depending on the severity and direct impact of these factors on us, we may be unable to secure additional financing to
meet our operating requirements on commercially acceptable terms favorable to us, or at all. 

Sources
of Liquidity 

Since
our inception, we have not generated any revenue from product sales and we have incurred significant operating losses and negative cash
flows from operations. We anticipate that we will continue to incur net losses for the foreseeable future. We do not have any drug-device
combination products that have achieved regulatory marketing approval and we do not expect to generate revenue from sales of any drug-device
combination product candidates for several years, if ever. While we are actively, in parallel to our clinical efforts, exploring commercialization
of our FDA-cleared RenovoCath delivery system on a standalone basis, which could generate revenues over the nearer term, our plans in
this regard may not lead to meaningful revenue generation or cash liquidity for us over the next 12 months, if at all. 

We
have financed our operations from inception through the date of this Report primarily through the issuance and sale of an aggregate
of 59.2 million from private placements of our convertible preferred stock, convertible debt securities prior to our August 2021
initial public offering, and the issuance of securities in our initial public offering, our RDO and other private placement
offerings, various loans and the exercise of warrants and common stock options. After deducting underwriting discounts and
commissions, placement agent fees and other offering expenses, net offerings were 53.8 million. During the first four months of
2024 alone, we raised new capital for aggregate gross proceeds of 17.2 million, to further advance our programs. 

Cash
Flows 

Our
primary uses of cash are to fund our operations including research and development and general and administrative expenses. We will continue
to incur operating losses in the future and expect that our research and development and general and administrative expenses will continue
to increase as we continue our research and development efforts with respect to clinical development of our product candidates, further
develop our therapy platform and ensure that we are complying with the requirements of being a public company. The cash used to fund
operating expenses is impacted by the timing of when we pay expenses, as reflected in the change in our outstanding accounts payable
and accrued expenses.

Contractual
Obligations and Other Commitments 

There
have been no significant changes in our contractual obligations or other commitments as of September 30, 2024. 

Critical
Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates 

The
accompanying management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our unaudited
condensed interim financial statements and the related disclosures, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation
of these unaudited condensed interim financial statements requires us to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the reported
amounts in our unaudited condensed interim financial statements and accompanying notes. We base our estimates on historical experience
and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making
judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ
from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. To the extent that there are material differences between these estimates
and actual results, our future financial statement presentation, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows will be affected.
Our critical accounting policies and estimates are detailed in our 2023 Annual Report. 

There
have been no significant changes to our critical accounting policies or significant judgments and estimates for the nine months ended
September 30, 2024, from those previously disclosed in our 2023 Annual Report. 

Convertible
Instruments and Embedded Derivatives 

We
evaluate all of our agreements to determine whether such instruments have derivatives or contain features that qualify as embedded derivatives.
We account for certain redemption features that are associated with the terms of convertible notes as liabilities at fair value and adjust
the instruments to their fair value at the end of each reporting period. For derivative financial instruments that are accounted for
as liabilities, the derivative instrument is initially recorded at its fair value and is then re-valued at each reporting date, with
changes in the fair value reported in other income (expenses), net in the statements of operations. Derivative instrument liabilities
are classified in the balance sheets as current or non-current based on whether or not net-cash settlement of the derivative instrument
could be required within 12 months of the balance sheet date. 

24 

April
2023 Warrants 

We
evaluate pre-funded warrants and April 2023 Warrant issued in connection with registered direct financing in April 2023 to determine whether
such warrants qualify for equity classification, or meet the definition of a derivative instrument, classified as a liability on the
Condensed Balance Sheets and measured at fair value at inception and at each reporting date with changes in fair value recognized in
the Condensed Statements of Operations in the period of change. 

Direct
Offering Costs 

Direct
offering costs consist principally of commissions, placement fees and legal fees, including other professional expenses incurred. We
evaluate the terms under the financing agreement to determine the classification of direct costs in the accompanying Condensed Statements
of Operations. 

Emerging
Growth Company and Smaller Reporting Company Status 

We
are an emerging growth company as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, as amended, or the JOBS Act.
Under the JOBS Act, companies have extended transition periods available for complying with new or revised accounting standards. We have
elected this exemption to delay adopting new or revised accounting standards. We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier
of (1) December 31, 2026, (2) the last day of the fiscal year in which we have total annual gross revenues of at least 1.235 billion,
(3) the date on which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act, or
(4) the date on which we have issued more than 1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the prior three-year period. An
emerging growth company may take advantage of specified reduced reporting requirements and is relieved of certain other significant requirements
that are otherwise generally applicable to public companies. As an emerging growth company, 

we may present only two
 years of audited financial statements, plus unaudited interim condensed financial statements for any interim period, and related
 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations; 

we may avail ourselves
 of the exemption from the requirement to obtain an attestation and report from our auditors on the assessment of our internal control
 over financial reporting pursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act; 

we may provide reduced
 disclosure about our executive compensation arrangements; and 

we do not require stockholder
 non-binding advisory votes on executive compensation or golden parachute arrangements. 

We
have elected to take advantage of certain of the reduced disclosure obligations in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and may elect to
take advantage of other reduced reporting requirements in future filings. As a result, the information that we provide to our stockholders
may be different than you might receive from other public reporting companies in which you hold equity interests. 

We
are also a smaller reporting company, meaning that the market value of our stock held by non-affiliates plus the proposed
aggregate amount of gross proceeds to us is less than 700.0 million and our annual revenue is less than
 100.0 million during the most recently completed fiscal year. We may continue to be a smaller reporting company if either (1) the market
value of our stock held by nonaffiliates is less than 250.0 million or (2) our annual revenue is less than 100.0 million during the
most recently completed fiscal year and the market value of our stock held by non-affiliates is less than 700.0 million. If we are a
smaller reporting company at the time we cease to be an emerging growth company, we may continue to rely on exemptions from certain disclosure
requirements that are available to smaller reporting companies. Specifically, as a smaller reporting company we may choose to present
only the two most recent fiscal years of audited financial statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K and, like emerging growth companies,
smaller reporting companies have reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation. 

Recently
Issued and Adopted Accounting Pronouncements 

There
were no new accounting pronouncements that were issued or became effective since the issuance of our 2023 Annual Report that had, or
are expected to have, a material impact on our unaudited condensed balance sheets, unaudited condensed statement of operations or unaudited
condensed statement of cash flows.

Item
3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 

The
disclosures in this Item are not required because we qualify as a smaller reporting company under federal securities laws. 

Item
4. Controls and Procedures 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Under
the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Principal Accounting Officer,
we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15I and 15d-15(e)
under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer
and Principal Accounting Officer have concluded that, during the period covered by this Report, our disclosure controls and procedures
were not effective due to our previously identified material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting. As a result, we
have performed additional analysis as deemed necessary to ensure that our financial statements were prepared in accordance with GAAP.
Accordingly, notwithstanding the identified material weaknesses, management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Principal Accounting
Officer, believes the financial statements included in this Report are fairly presented, in all material respects, in accordance with
GAAP. 

We
maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in our Exchange
Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and
that such information is accumulated, communicated and discussed with our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Principal
Accounting Officer or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Management recognizes that controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can only provide reasonable, not absolute,
assurance the desired control objectives will be met. In reaching a reasonable level of assurance, management has weighed the cost of
contemplated controls against their intended benefits. The design of any system of controls is based on management s assumptions
about the likelihood of future events. We cannot assure you that our controls will achieve their stated goals under all possible conditions.
Changes in future conditions may render our controls inadequate or may cause our degree of compliance with them to deteriorate. Because
of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. 

For
the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024, our management identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting
related to our control environment. A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of significant deficiencies, in internal control
over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial
statements will not be prevented or detected and corrected on a timely basis. 

Specifically,
we have determined that we have not maintained adequate formal accounting policies, processes and controls related to complex transactions
as a result of a lack of finance and accounting staff with the appropriate GAAP technical expertise needed to identify, evaluate and
account for complex and non-routine transactions. We also determined that we have not maintained sufficient staffing or written policies
and procedures for accounting and financial reporting, which contributed to the lack of a formalized process or controls for management s
timely review and approval of financial information. More specifically, we have determined that our financial statement close process
includes significant control gaps mainly driven by the small size of our accounting and finance staff and, as a result, a significant
lack of appropriate segregation of duties. This includes the ability of users to create and post journal entries without adequate compensating
review controls as well as review of system rights on the journal entry and financial close process. In addition, we did not have proper
information technology general controls related to user access, including the performance of user access reviews, access to edit data
in applications was not properly restricted, and formal approval of application access was not documented and retained. 

We
are in the process of implementing a number of measures to address the material weaknesses that has been identified including: (i) engaging
additional accounting and financial reporting personnel with GAAP and SEC reporting experience, (ii) developing, communicating and implementing
an accounting policy manual for our accounting and financial reporting personnel for recurring transactions and period-end closing processes,
and (iii) establishing effective monitoring and oversight controls for non-recurring and complex transactions to ensure the accuracy
and completeness of our financial statements and related disclosures. 

These
additional resources and procedures are designed to enable us to broaden the scope and quality of our internal review of underlying information
related to financial reporting and to formalize and enhance our internal control procedures. With the oversight of senior management
and our Audit Committee, we have begun taking steps and plan to take additional measures to remediate the underlying causes of the material
weaknesses. 

We
intend to complete the implementation of our remediation plan when we have sufficient cash to remediate our material weaknesses. Although
we believe that our remediation plan will improve our internal control over financial reporting, additional time may be required to fully
implement it and to make conclusions regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Our management will
closely monitor and modify, as appropriate, the remediation plan to eliminate the identified material weaknesses. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

Except
for the material weaknesses noted above, during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, there were no changes in our internal control over
financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial
reporting.

Part
II OTHER INFORMATION 

Item
1. Legal Proceedings 

From
time to time, we are engaged in various legal actions, claims and proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business, none of which
are expected to be material. The Company is not currently engaged in any material legal proceedings. 

Item
1A. Risk Factors 

An
investment in our securities is speculative and involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risk factors
below, as well as the other information in this Report, including our unaudited interim condensed financial statements and the related
notes and the section titled Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, 
and in our other public filings in evaluating our business, including those risk factors included in our 2023 Annual Report. The occurrence
of any of the events or developments described in our 2023 Annual Report, or summarized below or described elsewhere in this Report could
harm our business, financial condition, results of operations, growth prospects or stock price. In such an event, the market price of
our common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known
to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations and the market price of our common stock. 

Risk
Factors Summary 

The
following is a summary of principal factors and uncertainties that make investing in shares of our common stock risky and impact our
ability to execute on our business strategy include risks regarding the following. This summary is not exhaustive, and readers are therefore
encouraged to review the Risk Factors section and the Risk Factors section in our 2023 Annual Report in their
entirety: 

We are a clinical stage
 biopharmaceutical company, have a limited operating history and have no drug/device combination products approved for commercial
 sale, which makes it difficult to evaluate our current business and predict our future success and viability. 

We have incurred significant
 net losses in each period since inception, and we expect to continue to incur net losses for the foreseeable future. 

We will need to raise substantial
 additional capital to develop and fully commercialize RenovoGem and/or RenovoCath, and our failure to obtain funding when needed
 may force us to delay, reduce or eliminate our product development programs or collaboration efforts. As a result, there is substantial
 doubt about our ability to operate as a going concern. 

We
 may consider strategic alternatives in order to maximize stockholder value, including financing, strategic alliances, and licensing
 arrangements, particularly in connection with our proposal commercialization of RenovoCath should we utilize a commercial collaboration. We
 may not be able to identify or consummate any suitable strategic alternatives and any consummated strategic alternatives may not be
 successful. 

Our product candidates 
 commercial viability remains subject to current and future preclinical studies, clinical trials, regulatory approvals, and the risks
 generally inherent in the development of a pharmaceutical product candidate. If we are unable to successfully advance or develop
 our product candidates, our business will be materially harmed. 

If we do not achieve our
 projected development goals in the timeframes we announce and expect, our stock price may decline. 

Our product candidates
 may exhibit undesirable side effects when used alone or in combination with other approved pharmaceutical products or investigational
 new drugs, which may delay or preclude further development or regulatory approval or limit their use if approved. 

If the results of preclinical
 studies or clinical trials for our product candidates are negative, we could be delayed or precluded from the further development
 or commercialization of our product candidates, which could materially harm our business. 

If we are unable to satisfy
 any applicable regulatory requirements, we may not be able to commercialize our product candidates. 

If our product candidates
 are unable to compete effectively with marketed drugs targeting similar indications as our product candidates, our commercial opportunity
 will be reduced or eliminated. 

We may delay or terminate
 the development of our product candidates at any time if we believe the perceived market or commercial opportunity does not justify
 further investment, which could materially harm our business. 

Our future success depends
 on our ability to retain our key personnel and to attract, retain, and motivate qualified personnel, especially in light of an acute
 workforce shortage and hyper-competitive compensation environment. 

If we are unable to protect
 our intellectual property effectively, we may be unable to prevent third parties from using our technologies, which would impair
 our competitive advantage. 

The patents issued to us
 may not be broad enough to provide any meaningful protection, one or more of our competitors may develop more effective technologies,
 designs, or methods without infringing our intellectual property rights and one or more of our competitors may design around our
 proprietary technologies. 

The market price of our
 common stock may be volatile and fluctuate substantially, which could result in substantial losses for our investors. 

We issued a large number
 of shares of common stock and warrants to purchase common stock in connection with our 2024 financing activities. Substantial future
 sales of such shares of our common stock could cause the market price of our common stock to decline or have other adverse effects
 on our company.

2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds 

Unregistered
Sales of Equity Securities 

January
2024 Private Placement 

On
January 26, 2024, we entered into a series of subscription agreements (the January 2024 Subscription Agreements in connection
with a private placement offering to 92 accredited investors (the January 2024 Investors ), which was also closed on January
26, 2024, and pursuant to which we raised aggregate gross proceeds of 6,111,695 (the January 2024 Offering ). Under the
provisions of the January 2024 Subscription Agreements, the minimum amount of subscriptions required to close the January 2024 Offering
was 5 million, which minimum amount was satisfied, and the maximum offering amount was 15 million. In connection with the January 2024
Offering, we sold to the January 2024 Investors an aggregate of 6,133,414 shares (the January 2024 Shares of our common
stock and common stock purchase warrants (the January 2024 Investor Warrants to purchase an aggregate of up to 6,133,414
shares of common stock (the January 2024 Investor Warrant Shares and collectively with the January 2024 Shares and the
January 2024 Investor Warrants, the Investor Securities ). 

The
January 2024 Investors paid a purchase price of 0.99 for each January 2024 Share and related January 2024 Investor Warrant, which represents
a 10 discount to the intraday volume weighted average price of 1.10 for our shares of common stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market on

form attached hereto as Exhibit A (the Notice of Exercise ). Within the earlier of (i) two (2) Trading Days

of exercise as aforesaid, the Holder shall deliver the aggregate Exercise Price for the Warrant Shares specified in the applicable Notice

 for the number of Warrant Shares to which the Holder is entitled pursuant to such exercise to the address specified by the Holder
 in the Notice of Exercise by the date that is the earlier of (A) the earlier of (i) two (2) Trading Days and (ii) the number of days
 comprising the Standard Settlement Period, in each case after the delivery to the Company of the Notice of Exercise and (B) one (1)
 Trading Day after delivery of the aggregate Exercise Price to the Company (such date, the Warrant Share Delivery Date ).
 Upon delivery of the Notice of Exercise, the Holder shall be deemed for all corporate purposes to have become the holder of record
 of the Warrant Shares with respect to which this Warrant has been exercised, irrespective of the date of delivery of the Warrant
 Shares, provided that payment of the aggregate Exercise Price is received by the Warrant Share Delivery Date. As used herein, Standard
 Settlement Period means the standard settlement period, expressed in a number of Trading Days, on the Company s
 primary Trading Market with respect to the Common Stock as in effect on the date of delivery of the Notice of Exercise. 

ii. 
 Delivery
 of New Warrants Upon Exercise . If this Warrant shall have been exercised in part, the Company shall, at the request of a Holder
 and upon surrender of this Warrant certificate, at the time of delivery of the Warrant Shares, deliver to the Holder a new Warrant
 evidencing the rights of the Holder to purchase the unpurchased Warrant Shares called for by this Warrant, which new Warrant shall
 in all other respects be identical with this Warrant. 

iii. 
 Rescission
 Rights . If the Company fails to cause the Transfer Agent to transmit to the Holder the Warrant Shares pursuant to Section 2(d)(i)
 by the Warrant Share Delivery Date, then the Holder will have the right to rescind such exercise. 

iv. 
 No
 Fractional Shares or Scrip . No fractional shares or scrip representing fractional shares shall be issued upon the exercise of
 this Warrant. As to any fraction of a share which the Holder would otherwise be entitled to purchase upon such exercise, the Company
 shall, at its election, either pay a cash adjustment in respect of such final fraction in an amount equal to such fraction multiplied
 by the Exercise Price or round up to the next whole share. 

v. 
 Charges,
 Taxes and Expenses . Issuance of Warrant Shares shall be made without charge to the Holder for any issue or transfer tax or other
 incidental expense in respect of the issuance of such Warrant Shares, all of which taxes and expenses shall be paid by the Company,
 and such Warrant Shares shall be issued in the name of the Holder or in such name or names as may be directed by the Holder; provided ,
 however , that in the event that Warrant Shares are to be issued in a name other than the name of the Holder, this Warrant
 when surrendered for exercise shall be accompanied by the Assignment Form attached hereto duly executed by the Holder and the Company
 may require, as a condition thereto, the payment of a sum sufficient to reimburse it for any transfer tax incidental thereto. The
 Company shall pay all Transfer Agent fees required for same-day processing of any Notice of Exercise and all fees to the Depository
 Trust Company (or another established clearing corporation performing similar functions) required for same-day electronic delivery
 of the Warrant Shares.

vi. 
 Closing
 of Books . The Company will not close its stockholder books or records in any manner which prevents the timely exercise of this
 Warrant, pursuant to the terms hereof. 

e)
 Holder s Exercise Limitations . The Company shall not affect any exercise of this Warrant, and a Holder shall not have the
right to exercise any portion of this Warrant, pursuant to Section 2 or otherwise, to the extent that after giving effect to such issuance
after exercise as set forth on the applicable Notice of Exercise, the Holder (together with the Holder s Affiliates, and any other
Persons acting as a group together with the Holder or any of the Holder s Affiliates (such Persons, Attribution Parties )),
would beneficially own in excess of the Beneficial Ownership Limitation (as defined below). For purposes of the foregoing sentence, the
number of shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by the Holder and its Affiliates and Attribution Parties shall include the number
of shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of this Warrant with respect to which such determination is being made, but shall exclude
the number of shares of Common Stock which would be issuable upon (i) exercise of the remaining, nonexercised portion of this Warrant
beneficially owned by the Holder or any of its Affiliates or Attribution Parties and (ii) exercise or conversion of the unexercised or
nonconverted portion of any other securities of the Company (including, without limitation, any other Common Stock Equivalents) subject
to a limitation on conversion or exercise analogous to the limitation contained herein beneficially owned by the Holder or any of its
Affiliates or Attribution Parties. Except as set forth in the preceding sentence, for purposes of this Section 2(e), beneficial ownership
shall be calculated in accordance with Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, it being
acknowledged by the Holder that the Company is not representing to the Holder that such calculation is in compliance with Section 13(d)
of the Exchange Act and the Holder is solely responsible for any schedules required to be filed in accordance therewith. To the extent
that the limitation contained in this Section 2(e) applies, the determination of whether this Warrant is exercisable (in relation to
other securities owned by the Holder together with any Affiliates and Attribution Parties) and of which portion of this Warrant is exercisable
shall be in the sole discretion of the Holder, and the submission of a Notice of Exercise shall be deemed to be the Holder s determination
of whether this Warrant is exercisable (in relation to other securities owned by the Holder together with any Affiliates and Attribution
Parties) and of which portion of this Warrant is exercisable, in each case subject to the Beneficial Ownership Limitation, and the Company
shall have no obligation to verify or confirm the accuracy of such determination and shall have no liability for exercises of the Warrant
that are not in compliance with the Beneficial Ownership Limitation, except to the extent the Holder relies on a number of outstanding
shares of Common Stock that was provided by the Company. In addition, a determination as to any group status as contemplated above shall
be determined in accordance with Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, and the Company
shall have no obligation to verify or confirm the accuracy of such determination and shall have no liability for exercises of the Warrant
that are not in compliance with the Beneficial Ownership Limitation, except to the extent the Holder relies on the number of outstanding
shares of Common Stock that was provided by the Company. For purposes of this Section 2(e), in determining the number of outstanding
shares of Common Stock, a Holder may rely on the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock as reflected in (A) the Company s
most recent periodic or annual report filed with the Commission, as the case may be, (B) a more recent public announcement by the Company
or (C) a more recent written notice by the Company or the Transfer Agent setting forth the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding.
Upon the written request of a Holder, the Company shall within two (2) Trading Days confirm orally and in writing to the Holder the number
of shares of Common Stock then outstanding. In any case, the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be determined after giving
effect to the conversion or exercise of securities of the Company, including this Warrant, by the Holder or its Affiliates or Attribution
Parties since the date as of which such number of outstanding shares of Common Stock was reported. The Beneficial Ownership
Limitation shall be 9.99 of the number of shares of the Common Stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to the issuance
of shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of this Warrant. The Holder, upon written notice to the Company, may increase or decrease
the Beneficial Ownership Limitation provisions of this Section 2(e), provided that the Beneficial Ownership Limitation in no event exceeds
9.99 of the number of shares of the Common Stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to the issuance of shares of Common Stock
upon exercise of this Warrant held by the Holder and the provisions of this Section 2(e) shall continue to apply. Any increase in the
Beneficial Ownership Limitation will not be effective until the 61st day after such notice is delivered to the Company. The provisions
of this paragraph shall be construed and implemented in a manner otherwise than in strict conformity with the terms of this Section 2(e)
to correct this paragraph (or any portion hereof) which may be defective or inconsistent with the intended Beneficial Ownership Limitation
herein contained or to make changes or supplements necessary or desirable to properly give effect to such limitation. In addition, the
limitations contained in this paragraph shall apply to a successor holder of this Warrant. If the Warrant is unexercisable as a result
of the Holder s Beneficial Ownership Limitation, no alternate consideration is owing to the Holder.

Section
3 . Certain Adjustments . 

a)
 Stock Dividends and Splits . If the Company, at any time while this Warrant is outstanding: (i) pays a stock dividend or otherwise
makes a distribution or distributions on shares of its Common Stock or any other equity or equity equivalent securities payable in shares
of Common Stock (which, for avoidance of doubt, shall not include any shares of Common Stock issued by the Company upon exercise of this
Warrant), (ii) subdivides outstanding shares of Common Stock into a larger number of shares, (iii) combines (including by way of reverse
stock split) outstanding shares of Common Stock into a smaller number of shares, or (iv) issues by reclassification of shares of the
Common Stock any shares of capital stock of the Company, then in each case the Exercise Price shall be multiplied by a fraction of which
the numerator shall be the number of shares of Common Stock (excluding treasury shares, if any) outstanding immediately before such event
and of which the denominator shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event, and the number of
shares issuable upon exercise of this Warrant shall be proportionately adjusted such that the aggregate Exercise Price of this Warrant
shall remain unchanged. Any adjustment made pursuant to this Section 3(a) shall become effective immediately after the record date for
the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such dividend or distribution and shall become effective immediately after the
effective date in the case of a subdivision, combination or re-classification. 

b)
 Fundamental Transaction . If, at any time while this Warrant is outstanding, (i) the Company, directly or indirectly, in one or
more related transactions effects any merger or consolidation of the Company with or into another Person, (ii) the Company (or any Subsidiary),
directly or indirectly, effects any sale, lease, license, assignment, transfer, conveyance or other disposition of all or substantially
all of the Company s assets in one or a series of related transactions, (iii) any, direct or indirect, purchase offer, tender offer
or exchange offer (whether by the Company or another Person) is completed pursuant to which holders of Common Stock are permitted to
sell, tender or exchange their shares for other securities, cash or property and has been accepted by the holders of more than 50 of
the aggregate voting power of the common equity of the Company, (iv) the Company, directly or indirectly, in one or more related transactions
effects any reclassification, reorganization or recapitalization of shares of Common Stock or any compulsory share exchange pursuant
to which the shares of Common Stock are effectively converted into or exchanged for other securities, cash or property, or (v) the Company,
directly or indirectly, in one or more related transactions consummates a stock or share purchase agreement or other business combination
(including, without limitation, a reorganization, recapitalization, spin-off, merger or scheme of arrangement) with another Person or
group of Persons whereby such other Person or group acquires more than 50 of the aggregate voting power of the common equity of the
Company (not including any shares of Common Stock held by the other Person or other Persons making or party to, or associated or affiliated
with the other Persons making or party to, such stock or share purchase agreement or other business combination) (each a Fundamental
Transaction ), then, upon any subsequent exercise of this Warrant, the Holder shall have the right to receive, for each Warrant
Share that would have been issuable upon such exercise immediately prior to the occurrence of such Fundamental Transaction, which, for
the avoidance of doubt does not include any Warrant Shares subject to an Initial Exercise Date that has not yet occurred, at the option
of the Holder (without regard to any limitation in Section 2(e) on the exercise of this Warrant), the number of shares of Common Stock
of the successor or acquiring corporation or of the Company, if it is the surviving corporation, and any additional consideration (the
 Alternate Consideration receivable as a result of such Fundamental Transaction by a holder of the number of shares
of Common Stock for which this Warrant is exercisable immediately prior to such Fundamental Transaction (without regard to any limitation
in Section 2(e) on the exercise of this Warrant, but excluding any Warrant Shares subject to an Initial Exercise Date that has not yet
occurred). For purposes of any such exercise, the determination of the Exercise Price shall be appropriately adjusted to apply to such
Alternate Consideration based on the amount of Alternate Consideration issuable in respect of one share of Common Stock in such Fundamental
Transaction, and the Company shall apportion the Exercise Price among the Alternate Consideration in a reasonable manner reflecting the
relative value of any different components of the Alternate Consideration. If holders of Common Stock are given any choice as to the
securities, cash or property to be received in a Fundamental Transaction, then the Holder shall be given the same choice as to the Alternate
Consideration it receives upon any exercise of this Warrant following such Fundamental Transaction. 

6 

c)
 Calculations . All calculations under this Section 3 shall be made to the nearest cent or the nearest 1/100th of a share, as the
case may be. For purposes of this Section 3, the number of shares of Common Stock deemed to be issued and outstanding as of a given date
shall be the sum of the number of shares of Common Stock (excluding treasury shares, if any) issued and outstanding. 

d)
 Voluntary Adjustment by Company . Subject to the rules and regulations of the Trading Market, the Company may at any time during
the term of this Warrant, subject to the prior written consent of the Holder, reduce the then current Exercise Price to any amount and
for any period of time deemed appropriate by the board of directors of the Company. 

Section
4 . Transfer of Warrant . 

a)
 Transferability . This Warrant and all rights hereunder are transferable, in whole or in part, with the prior written consent of
the Company, upon surrender of this Warrant at the principal office of the Company or its designated agent, together with a written assignment
of this Warrant substantially in the form attached hereto duly executed by the Holder or its agent or attorney and funds sufficient to
pay any transfer taxes payable upon the making of such transfer. Any such request for assignment must be accompanied by the name of the
proposed assignee and the number of Warrant Shares subject to such assignment, together with such other reasonable information the Company
may request to ensure the assignment complies with applicable law. Upon such surrender and, if required, such payment, the Company shall
execute and deliver a new Warrant or Warrants in the name of the assignee or assignees, as applicable, and in the denomination or denominations
specified in such instrument of assignment, and shall issue to the assignor a new Warrant evidencing the portion of this Warrant not
so assigned, and this Warrant shall promptly be cancelled. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Holder shall not be required
to physically surrender this Warrant to the Company unless the Holder has assigned this Warrant in full, in which case, the Holder shall
surrender this Warrant to the Company within three (3) Trading Days of the date on which the Holder delivers an assignment form to the
Company assigning this Warrant in full. The Warrant, if properly assigned in accordance herewith, may be exercised by a new holder for
the purchase of Warrant Shares without having a new Warrant issued. 

b)
Upon the written consent the Company as required by Section 4(a), subject to the Holder s compliance with the restrictive legend
on this Warrant and the transfer restrictions set forth herein, this Warrant and all rights hereunder are transferable, in whole or in
part, upon surrender of this Warrant at the principal office of the Company or its designated agent, together with a written assignment
of this Warrant substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit B duly executed by the Holder or its agent or attorney and
funds sufficient to pay any transfer taxes payable upon the making of such transfer. Upon such surrender and, if required, such payment,
the Company shall execute and deliver a new Warrant or Warrants in the name of the assignee or assignees, as applicable, and in the denomination
or denominations specified in such instrument of assignment, and shall issue to the assignor a new Warrant evidencing the portion of
this Warrant not so assigned, and this Warrant shall promptly be cancelled. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Holder
shall not be required to physically surrender this Warrant to the Company unless the Holder has assigned this Warrant in full, in which
case, the Holder shall surrender this Warrant to the Company within three (3) Trading Days of the date on which the Holder delivers an
assignment form to the Company assigning this Warrant in full. The Warrant, if properly assigned in accordance herewith, may be exercised
by a new holder for the purchase of Warrant Shares or Exchange Warrants without having a new Warrant issued. 

7 

c)
 New Warrants . This Warrant may be divided or combined with other Warrants upon presentation hereof at the aforesaid office of
the Company, together with a written notice specifying the names and denominations in which new Warrants are to be issued, signed by
the Holder or its agent or attorney. Subject to compliance with Section 4(a), as to any transfer which may be involved in such division
or combination, the Company shall execute and deliver a new Warrant or Warrants in exchange for the Warrant or Warrants to be divided
or combined in accordance with such notice. All Warrants issued on transfers or exchanges shall be dated the Issue Date of this Warrant
and shall be identical with this Warrant except as to the number of Warrant Shares issuable pursuant thereto. 

d)
 Warrant Register . The Company shall register this Warrant, upon records to be maintained by the Company for that purpose (the
 Warrant Register ), in the name of the record Holder hereof from time to time. The Company may deem and treat the
registered Holder of this Warrant as the absolute owner hereof for the purpose of any exercise hereof or any distribution to the Holder,
and for all other purposes, absent actual notice to the contrary. 

e)
 Representation by the Holder . The Holder, by the acceptance hereof, represents and warrants that it is acquiring this Warrant
and, upon any exercise hereof, will acquire the Warrant Shares issuable upon such exercise, for its own account and not with a view to
or for distributing or reselling such Warrant Shares or any part thereof in violation of the Securities Act or any applicable state securities
law, except pursuant to sales registered or exempted under the Securities Act. 

Section
5 . Miscellaneous . 

a)
 No Rights as Stockholder Until Exercise; No Settlement in Cash . This Warrant does not entitle the Holder to any voting rights,
dividends or other rights as a stockholder of the Company prior to the exercise hereof as set forth in Section 2(d)(i), except as expressly
set forth in Section 3. Without limiting the rights of a Holder to receive the cash payments contemplated pursuant to Section 2(d)(iv),
in no event will the Company be required to net cash settle an exercise of this Warrant. 

b)
 Loss, Theft, Destruction or Mutilation of Warrant . The Company covenants that upon receipt by the Company of evidence reasonably
satisfactory to it of the loss, theft, destruction or mutilation of this Warrant or any stock certificate relating to the Warrant Shares,
and in case of loss, theft or destruction, of indemnity or security reasonably satisfactory to it (which, in the case of the Warrant,
shall not include the posting of any bond), and upon surrender and cancellation of such Warrant or stock certificate, if mutilated, the
Company will make and deliver a new Warrant or stock certificate of like tenor and dated as of such cancellation, in lieu of such Warrant
or stock certificate. 

c)
 Saturdays, Sundays, Holidays, etc . If the last or appointed day for the taking of any action or the expiration of any right required
or granted herein shall not be a Trading Day, then, such action may be taken or such right may be exercised on the next succeeding Trading
Day. 

d)
 Authorized Shares . The Company covenants that, at all times during the period the Warrant is outstanding, it will reserve from
its authorized and unissued Common Stock a sufficient number of shares to provide for the issuance of the Warrant Shares upon the exercise
of any purchase rights under this Warrant. The Company further covenants that its issuance of this Warrant shall constitute full authority
to its officers who are charged with the duty of issuing the necessary Warrant Shares upon the exercise of the purchase rights under
this Warrant. The Company will take all such reasonable action as may be necessary to assure that such Warrant Shares may be issued as
provided herein without violation of any applicable law or regulation, or of any requirements of the Trading Market upon which the Common
Stock may be listed. The Company covenants that all Warrant Shares which may be issued upon the exercise of the purchase rights represented
by this Warrant will, upon exercise of the purchase rights represented by this Warrant and payment for such Warrant Shares in accordance
herewith, be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and free from all taxes, liens and charges created by the
Company in respect of the issue thereof (other than taxes in respect of any transfer occurring contemporaneously with such issue). 

8 

Except
and to the extent as waived or consented to by the Holder, the Company shall not by any action, including, without limitation, amending
its certificate of incorporation or through any reorganization, transfer of assets, consolidation, merger, dissolution, issue or sale
of securities or any other voluntary action, avoid or seek to avoid the observance or performance of any of the terms of this Warrant,
but will at all times in good faith assist in the carrying out of all such terms and in the taking of all such actions as may be necessary
or appropriate to protect the rights of Holder as set forth in this Warrant against impairment (it being understood that this Warrant
shall not in any case prevent the Company from effecting any such amendment, reorganization, transfer, consolidation, merger, dissolution,
issuance or sale). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company will (i) not increase the par value of any Warrant Shares
above the amount payable therefor upon such exercise immediately prior to such increase in par value, (ii) take all such action as may
be necessary or appropriate in order that the Company may validly and legally issue fully paid and nonassessable Warrant Shares upon
the exercise of this Warrant and (iii) use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain all such authorizations, exemptions or consents
from any public regulatory body having jurisdiction thereof, as may be, necessary to enable the Company to perform its obligations under
this Warrant. 

Before
taking any action, which would result in an adjustment in the number of Warrant Shares for which this Warrant is exercisable or in the
Exercise Price, the Company shall obtain all such authorizations or exemptions thereof, or consents thereto, as may be necessary from
any public regulatory body or bodies having jurisdiction thereof. 

e)
 Jurisdiction . All questions concerning the construction, validity, enforcement and interpretation of this Warrant shall be determined
in accordance with the provisions of the Supply Agreement. 

f)
 Restrictions . The Holder acknowledges that the Warrant Shares acquired upon the exercise of this Warrant, if not registered, will
have restrictions upon resale imposed by state and federal securities laws. 

g)
 Nonwaiver and Expenses . No course of dealing or any delay or failure to exercise any right hereunder on the part of Holder shall
operate as a waiver of such right or otherwise prejudice the Holder s rights, powers or remedies, notwithstanding the fact that
the right to exercise this Warrant terminates on the Termination Date. Without limiting any other provision of this Warrant, if the Company
willfully and knowingly fails to comply with any provision of this Warrant, which results in any material damages to the Holder, the
Company shall pay to the Holder such amounts as shall be sufficient to cover any costs and expenses including, but not limited to, reasonable
attorneys fees, including those of appellate proceedings, incurred by the Holder in collecting any amounts due pursuant hereto
or in otherwise enforcing any of its rights, powers or remedies hereunder. 

h)
 Notices . Any notice, request or other document required or permitted to be given or delivered to the Holder by the Company shall
be delivered in accordance with the notice provisions of the Supply Agreement. 

i)
 Limitation of Liability . No provision hereof, in the absence of any affirmative action by the Holder to exercise this Warrant
to purchase Warrant Shares, and no enumeration herein of the rights or privileges of the Holder, shall give rise to any liability of
the Holder for the purchase price of any Common Stock or as a stockholder of the Company, whether such liability is asserted by the Company
or by creditors of the Company. 

9 

j)
 Remedies . The Holder, in addition to being entitled to exercise all rights granted by law, including recovery of damages, will
be entitled to specific performance of its rights under this Warrant. The Company agrees that monetary damages would not be adequate
compensation for any loss incurred by reason of a breach by it of the provisions of this Warrant and hereby agrees to waive and not to
assert the defense in any action for specific performance that a remedy at law would be adequate. 

k)
 Successors and Assigns . Subject to applicable securities laws, this Warrant and the rights and obligations evidenced hereby shall
inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the successors and permitted assigns of the Company and the successors and permitted assigns
of Holder. The provisions of this Warrant are intended to be for the benefit of any Holder from time to time of this Warrant and shall
be enforceable by the Holder or holder of Warrant Shares. 

l)
 Amendment . This Warrant may only be modified or amended, or the provisions hereof waived, with the written consent of the Company,
on the one hand, and the Holder of this Warrant, on the other hand. 

m)
 Severability . Wherever possible, each provision of this Warrant shall be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid
under applicable law, but if any provision of this Warrant shall be prohibited by or invalid under applicable law, such provision shall
be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or invalidity, without invalidating the remainder of such provisions or the remaining
provisions of this Warrant. 

n)
 Headings . The headings used in this Warrant are for the convenience of reference only and shall not, for any purpose, be deemed
a part of this Warrant.
