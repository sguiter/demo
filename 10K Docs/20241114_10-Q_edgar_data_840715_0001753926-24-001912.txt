compared to as of December 31, 2023 . Our working capital was as of September 30, 2024 . Net cash used in operating activities was for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , a decrease of compared to of cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 . The decrease in cash is mainly due to payment of dividends in April 2024 and in May 2023. These conditions raise substantial doubt about continuing as a going concern. T he Company believes, although there can be no assurance, that the current cash position and effective management of working capital, will provide the liquidity needed to meet our operating needs through at least November 14, 2025 . The Company also believes that its strong portfolio of intellectual property and its solid brand equity in the market will enable it to raise additional capital if and when needed to meet its short and long-term financing needs; however, there can be no assurance that, if needed, the Company will be successful in obtaining the necessary funds through equity or debt financing on favorable terms or at all. If the Company needs additional capital and is unable to secure financing, it may be required to further reduce expenses, or delay product development and enhancement.

 BUSINESS OVERVIEW 
 
 ClearOne is a global Company that designs, develops and sells conferencing, collaboration, and AV networking solutions for voice and visual communications. The performance and simplicity of our advanced, comprehensive solutions offer a high level of functionality, reliability and scalability. We derive a major portion of our revenue from audio conferencing products and microphones by promoting our products in the professional audio-visual channel. We have extended our total addressable market from the installed audio conferencing market to adjacent complementary markets microphones, video collaboration and AV networking. We have achieved this through strategic technological acquisitions as well as by internal product development.

MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 On March 11, 2024, we announced a one -time special cash dividend of 0.50 per share of ClearOne common stock, paid on April 10, 2024 to shareholders of record on April 2, 2024. 
 On January 23, 2024 we launched the DIALOG 20 USB wireless microphone system at Integrated Systems Europe (ISE) 2024 , a major global audiovisual expo. ClearOne s booth at ISE 2024 recorded a 319 increase in unique visitors compared to the number of unique visitors the Company s booth recorded in 2023 . The DIALOG UVHF Wireless Microphone System also received AV Technology Magazine s Best in Show award at ISE 2024 , having previously garnered other notable industry awards in 2023 . 
 On August 8, 2024, the DIALOG UVHF wireless Microphone system was named a winner of the 2024 Communications Solutions products of the year award. 
 On September 9, 2024, ClearOne recorded a 31 increase in unique visitors at our 2024 Infocomm India trade show booth, while the overall annual increase of all attendees at that trade show was only 17 . 
 Overall revenue decreased by 49 in the third quarter of 2024 when compared to the third quarter of 2023 , primarily due to a significant decrease in revenues from the audio-conferencing category. The revenue decline was also caused by significantly reduced demand for our products in many regions including USA, Europe and China when compared to 2023 -Q 3 revenues. We believe this revenue decline was primarily due to the cumulative impact of past production shortages. We believe that lack of product availability has caused some of our channel partners to purchase and install competing brands. Historically, we have seen a lag of several months between the time that our professional conferencing products are specified for installation and the date when those products are installed. Since our product availability was constrained through a significant part of Q 4 2023 , we believe our revenue was impacted negatively by these market dynamics through much of Q 3 2024 . We have also faced sales headwinds from our products lack of Microsoft Teams certification, despite their longtime functional compatibility with this platform. Our work through the first nine months of 2024 has focused on mitigating these impacts through maintaining consistent dialogues, product demonstrations, and feedback cycles with end users and channel partners, along with improving our visibility at key industry events. In addition, we saw a reduction in sales in the Middle East region, where we had previously experienced consistent sales growth, as we transitioned to a new distributor for the Middle East region. We believe o ur revenue performance in 2024 -Q 3 compared to 2023-Q3 also was to a small extent impacted negatively due to increased costs associated with electronic raw materials that have affected the global manufacturing of high tech products. We expect these increased costs in various degrees to continue through the remainder of 2024 and 2025 . 
 Our gross profit margin decreased to 24.4 during the third quarter of 2024 from 33.1 during the third quarter of 2023 . Our gross profit margin decreased to 20.7 during the first nine months of 2024 compared to 32.8 during the first nine months of 2023 . This is due to scrapping of inventory items and selling aged inventory at larger discounts. 
 Net loss increased from 1.4 million in the third quarter of 2023 to 2.1 million in the third quarter of 2024 . The increase in net loss was mainly due to (a) decrease in revenues and decrease in gross margin from purchase price variances from increasing vendor costs and sales price discounts. Net loss increased from 3.2 million for the first nine months of 2023 to 6.8 million for the first nine months of 2024 . The increase was mainly due to (a) decrease in revenue by 6.1 million, (b) significant decrease in Gross margin from 32.8 to 20.7 and (c) decrease in interest income. 
 We believe, although there can be no assurance, that we can return to generating operating profits through our strategic initiatives namely product innovation and cost reduction. 
 Industry conditions 
 We operate in a very dynamic and highly competitive industry which is dominated on the one hand by a few players with respect to certain products like traditional video conferencing appliances while on the other hand influenced heavily by a fragmented reseller market consisting of numerous regional and local players. The industry is also characterized by venture capitalist-funded start-ups and private companies willing to fund cumulative cash losses in order to gain market share and achieve certain non-financial goals. It has become increasingly important to have higher interoperability with other products in the audio-visual market as well as certifications from leading video conferencing service providers like Microsoft and Zoom .

 The audio-visual products market is characterized by intense competition and rapidly evolving technology. Our competitors vary within each product category. Our installed professional audio-conferencing products, which is our flagship product category, continue to be ahead of the competition despite the reduction in revenues. Our strength in this space is largely due to our fully integrated suite of products consisting of DSP wide range of professional microphone products and video collaboration products. Despite our strong leadership position in the installed professional audio-conferencing market, we face challenges to revenue growth due to the lack of component availability to build our products in 2023 driving growth to competitors, pricing pressures from new competitors attracted to the commercial market due to higher margins, and the lack of certifications from Microsoft. Notably, the Microsoft Teams device certification program is closed to new meeting room devices and solutions. Although we have requested admission into this certification program on multiple occasions ClearOne has been denied admission by Microsoft so far. 
 
 Our video products and beamforming microphone arrays, especially highly advanced BMA 360 and BMA-CT are critical to our long-term growth. We face intense competition in this market from well-established market leaders as well as emerging players rich with marketing funds. We expect our strategy of making our products more interoperable with other audio-visual products, continuing to improve the quality of our high-end audio-conferencing products and microphones, and offering a wide range of innovative professional cameras will generate growth in the near future. 
 
 We derive a significant portion of our revenue (approximately 61.6 in the first nine months of 2024 from operations outside North and South America and expect this trend to continue in the future. Most of our revenue from ou tside the U.S. is billed in U.S. dollars and is not exposed to any significant currency risk. However, we are exposed to foreign exchange risk if the U.S. dollar is strong against other currencies as it will make U.S. Dollar denominated prices of our products less competitive. 
 
 Deferred Product Revenue 
 
 Deferred product revenue decreased to 22 thousand on September 30, 2024 compared to 30 thousand on December 31, 2023 . 
 
 A detailed discussion of our results of operations follows below.

Revenue 
 
 Our revenue decreased to 2.5 million in 2024 - Q3 compared to 4.9 million in 2023 - Q3 due to a 50 decline in audio conferencing, a 40 decline in video products, and a 50 decrease in microphones. Our traditional ceiling mics, personal audio-conferencing products, and video cameras suffered revenue declines due to lack of demand and the loss of the major customer. When comparing 2024-Q 3 to 2023-Q 3 , all sales regions suffered revenue loss. Revenues from Americas declined by 61 , from Europe and Africa by 50 , and from Asia Pacific (including Middle East, India and Australia) by 34 . 
 
 Our revenues decreased to 8.4 million in 2024 - YTD compared to 14.6 million 2023 - YTD due to a 48 decline in audio conferencing, a 30 decline in video products, and a 39 decrease in microphones. Our traditional ceiling mics, personal audio-conferencing products. and video cameras suffered revenue declines due to lack of demand. When comparing 2024 - YTD to 2023 - YTD , all sales regions suffered revenue loss. Revenues from Americas decline by 56 , from Europe and Africa by 44 , and from Asia Pacific (including Middle east, India and Australia) by 23 . 
 
 Costs of Goods Sold and Gross Profit 
 
 Cost of goods sold includes expenses associated with finished goods purchased from outsourced manufacturers, the repackaging of our products, our manufacturing and operations organization, property and equipment depreciation, warranty expense, freight expense, royalty payments, and the allocation of overhead expens es. 
 
 Our gross profit margin decreased from 33.1 during 2023 - Q3 to 24.4 during 2024 - Q3 . 
 
 The decline was due to discounting products to close sales and an increase in purchase price variances from increasing vendor costs. 
 
 Our gross profit margin decreased from 32.8 during 2023 - YTD to 20.7 during 2024 - YTD . 
 The decline was due to increased inventory scrap and write-off costs, discounting products to close sales, and an increase in purchase price variance from increasing vendor costs.

MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 
 Our profitability in the near term continues to depend significantly on our revenues from professionally installed audio-conferencing products. We hold long-term inventory and if we are unable to sell our long-term inventory, our profitability might be affected by inventory write-offs and price mark-downs. Our long-term inventory consists primarily of three product categories. These categories are as follows: Converge Pro and Beamforming microphone array products, cameras, and raw materials that will be used primarily for manufacturing professional audio-conferencing products and BMA microphones. Any business changes that are adverse to these product lines could potentially impact our ability to sell our long-term inventory in addition to our current inventory. 
 
 Operating Expenses 
 
 Operating expenses include sales and marketing S M expenses, research and product development R D expenses and general and administrative G A expenses. Total operating expenses in 2024 - Q3 were 2.8 million compared to 3.1 million in 2023 - Q3 . Total operating expenses were 8.9 million for 2024 - YTD compared to 9.8 million for 2023 - YTD . The following contains a more detailed discussion of expenses related to sales and marketing, research and product development, general and administrative, and other items.

 S M expenses remained consistent in 2024 - YTD 3.6 million compared to 3.6 million in 2023 - YTD . 
 .

 R D expenses remained consistent in 2024-Q3, 0.8 million compared to 0.8 million in 2023 - Q3 . 
 
 R D expenses decreased to 2.5 million in 2024 - YTD compared to 2.8 million for 2023 - YTD. The reduction was primarily due to a reduction in personnel.

 G A expenses decreased to 1.0 million in 2024 - Q3 compared to 1.1 million in 2023 - Q3 . The reduction was primarily due to (a) decrease in insurance expenses, (b) and a reduction in amortization expense. 
 
 G A expenses decreased to 2.8 million in 2024 - YTD compared to 3.4 million in 2023 - YTD . The reduction was primarily due to (a) a decrease in legal expenses, (b) and a decrease in insurance expenses, (c) reduction in employee-related expenses, (d) and a reduction in amortization expense.

MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 
 Other income (expense), net 
 
 Other income (expense), net includes interest income, foreign currency changes and gain or loss on disposal of assets. Other income for 2024 - Q3 included 0.03 million of interest income received on marketable securities compared to 0.24 million in 2023 - Q3 
 
 Other income of 2024-Q3 includes 0.087 million of gain on disposal of inventory compared to (0.08) million of interest expense on debt in 2023-Q3. 
 
 Provision for income taxes 
 
 During each of the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , we did not recognize any benefit from the losses incurred due to setting up a full valuation allowance. 
 
 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 
 As of September 30, 2024 , our cash and cash equivalents were approximately 1.7 million compared to 17.8 million as of December 31, 2023 . Our working capital was 19.7 million and 39.1 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , respectively. 
 
 Cash used in opera ting activities was approximately 4.6 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , a decrease of approximately 55.7 million from 51.1 million of cash provided by operating activities in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 . The decrease in cash inflow was primarily due to the difference between 55 million in receipts from legal settlements received in first half of 2023 and 0 received in first nine months of 2024 . 
 
 Cash provided by investing activities in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 2.9 million compared to 6.8 million of cash used in investing activities in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 . The increase in cash provided by investing activities was primarily due to proceeds from sale of marketable securities of 7.9 million offset by purchases of marketable securities of (4.7) million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 3 million and (9.3) million respectively for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 . 
 
 Cash used in financing activities in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 14.5 million compared to 31.7 million of cash being used in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 . This was comprised primarily of dividend distributions payments made. 
 
 The Company believes, although there can be no assurance, that the current cash position and effective management of working capital, will provide the liquidity needed to meet our operating needs through at least November 14, 2025 . The Company also believes that its strong portfolio of intellectual property and its solid brand equity in the market will enable it to raise additional capital if and when needed to meet its short and long-term financing needs; however, there can be no assurance that, if needed, the Company will be successful in obtaining the necessary funds through equity or debt financing on favorable terms or at all. If the Company needs additional capital and is unable to secure financing, it may be required to further reduce expenses, or delay product development and enhancement. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024 , we had open purchase orders of approximately 3.5 million, mostly for the purchase of inventory. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024 , we had inventory totaling 16.5 million, of which non-current inventory accounted for 2.2 million. This compares to total inventories of 13.8 million, which includes non-current inventory of 3.1 million as of December 31, 2023 .

None. 

Item 1A. RISK FACTORS 

The risk factors under
Part I, Item 1A in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 are
hereby supplemented with the following additional risk factor: 
 
 Our common stock trades at
prices less than 1.00 which is the minimum bid price requirement under
Nasdaq s continued listing standards, as such our common stock may be subject
to delisting from the Nasdaq Capital Market. 
 
 On June 20, 2024, we received a
letter (the Notice from the Listing Qualifications Department (the Staff of the Nasdaq Stock Market Nasdaq informing us that because the closing bid
price for the Company s common stock listed on Nasdaq was below 1.00 for 30 consecutive
trading days, we are not in compliance with the minimum bid price requirement
for continued listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market, as set forth in Nasdaq
Marketplace Rule 5550(a)(2) (the Minimum Bid Price Requirement ). The last
reported closing price of our common stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market on August
13, 2024 was 0.6411 per share and has been below the 1.00 closing bid price
since May 6, 2024. In accordance with Nasdaq Marketplace Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), we
have a period of 180 calendar days from June 20, 2024, or until December 17,
2024, to regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement. If at any
time before December 17, 2024, the closing bid price of our common stock closes
at or above 1.00 per share for a minimum of 10 consecutive trading days (which
number days may be extended by Nasdaq), Nasdaq will provide written
notification that we have achieved compliance with the Minimum Bid Price
Requirement, and the matter would be resolved. If compliance is not achieved
within the 180-day period, Nasdaq would provide written notification to us that
our common stock is subject to delisting. In the event that we fail to regain
compliance with Nasdaq continued listing standards by the expiration of the
applicable cure period or any extension period, Nasdaq will commence suspension
and delisting procedures with respect to our common stock, which could impair
the value of your investment. 
 
 If our common stock is delisted
from Nasdaq Capital Market in the future, such securities may be traded on the
over-the-counter markets. Such alternative markets, however, are generally
considered to be less efficient than, and not as broad as, Nasdaq. Accordingly,
delisting of our common stock from Nasdaq could have a significant negative
effect on the trading volume, liquidity and market price of our common stock.
In addition, the delisting of our common stock could adversely affect our
ability to raise capital on terms acceptable to us or at all and could reduce
the number of investors willing to hold or acquire our common stock. 

Item 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS 

(a) None. 
 
 (b) Not applicable. 
 
 (c) None. 

Item 3. DEFAULTS UPON SENIOR SECURITIES
