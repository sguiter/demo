United States Cellular Corporation 
 Management s Discussion and Analysis of 
 Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

Executive Overview 
 The following discussion and analysis compares United States Cellular Corporation s (UScellular) financial results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. It should be read in conjunction with UScellular s interim consolidated financial statements and notes included herein, and with the description of UScellular s business, its audited consolidated financial statements and Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD A) included in UScellular s Annual Report on Form 10-K (Form 10-K) for the year ended December 31, 2023. Certain numbers included herein are rounded to millions for ease of presentation; however, certain calculated amounts and percentages are determined using the unrounded numbers. 
 During the second quarter of 2024, UScellular modified its reporting structure due to the planned disposal of its wireless operations and, as a result, disaggregated its operations into two reportable segments Wireless and Towers. This presentation reflects how UScellular's chief operating decision maker allocates resources and evaluates operating performance following this strategic shift. Prior periods have been updated to conform to the new reportable segments. See Note 13 Business Segment Information in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 
 This report contains statements that are not based on historical facts, which may be identified by words such as believes, anticipates, estimates, expects, plans, intends, projects, will and similar expressions. These statements constitute and represent forward looking statements as this term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such forward looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results, events or developments to be significantly different from any future results, events or developments expressed or implied by such forward looking statements. See the disclosure under the heading Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 Safe Harbor Cautionary Statement elsewhere in this report for additional information. 
 The accounting policies of UScellular conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). However, UScellular uses certain non-GAAP financial measures in the MD A and the business segment information. A discussion of the reasons UScellular determines these metrics to be useful and reconciliations of these measures to their most directly comparable measures determined in accordance with GAAP are included in the disclosure under the heading Supplemental Information Relating to Non-GAAP Financial Measures within the MD A of this report.

 UScellular Mission and Strategy 
 UScellular s mission is to connect its customers to what matters most to them. This includes providing exceptional wireless communication services which enhance consumers lives, increase the competitiveness of local businesses, and improve the efficiency of government operations in the markets UScellular serves. 
 UScellular's strategy is to attract and retain customers by providing a high-quality network, outstanding customer service, and competitive devices, plans and pricing - all provided with a local community focus. Strategic efforts include: 
 UScellular offers economical and competitively priced service plans and devices to its customers and is focused on increasing revenues from sales of related products such as device protection plans and from services such as fixed wireless home internet. In addition, UScellular is focused on expanding its solutions available to business and government customers. 
 UScellular continues to enhance its network capabilities, including by deploying 5G technology to help address customers growing demand for data services and create opportunities for new services requiring high speed and reliability as well as low latency. In 2019-2023, UScellular focused on 5G coverage and predominantly used low-band spectrum to launch 5G services in portions of substantially all of its markets. During 2023 and 2024, UScellular has focused on deploying 5G over its mid-band spectrum, largely overlapping areas already covered with low-band 5G service to enhance speed and capacity for UScellular s mobility and fixed wireless services. Investments in the next several years are expected to be focused on continued mid-band spectrum deployment to enhance speed and capacity needs, building on the existing 5G coverage across UScellular s footprint. 
 UScellular seeks to grow revenue in its Towers segment primarily through increasing third-party colocations on existing towers through providing unique tower locations, attractive terms and streamlined implementation to third-party wireless operators. 
 Announced Transactions and Strategic Alternatives Review 
 On August 4, 2023, TDS and UScellular announced that the Boards of Directors of both companies decided to initiate a process to explore a range of strategic alternatives for UScellular. On May 28, 2024, UScellular announced that its Board of Directors unanimously approved the execution of a Securities Purchase Agreement (Securities Purchase Agreement) by and among TDS, UScellular, T-Mobile US, Inc. (T-Mobile) and USCC Wireless Holdings, LLC, pursuant to which, among other things, UScellular agreed to sell its wireless operations and select spectrum assets to T-Mobile for a purchase price, subject to adjustment as specified in the Securities Purchase Agreement, of 4,400 million, which is payable in a combination of cash and the assumption of up to approximately 2,000 million in debt. The Securities Purchase Agreement also contemplates, among other things, a Short-Term Spectrum Manager Lease Agreement that will become effective at the closing date, which provides T-Mobile with an exclusive license to use certain UScellular spectrum assets at no cost for up to one-year for the purpose of providing continued, uninterrupted service to customers. The transactions are expected to close in mid-2025, subject to the receipt of regulatory approvals and the satisfaction of customary closing conditions. 
 
 On October 17, 2024, UScellular, and certain subsidiaries of UScellular, entered into a License Purchase Agreement (Verizon Purchase Agreement) with Verizon Communications Inc. (Verizon) to sell certain AWS, Cellular and PCS wireless spectrum licenses and agreed to grant Verizon certain rights to lease such licenses prior to the transaction close for total proceeds of 1,000 million. As of September 30, 2024, the book value of the wireless spectrum licenses to be sold was 586 million. The transaction is subject to regulatory approval and other customary closing conditions, and is contingent on the closing of the T-Mobile transaction and the termination of the T-Mobile Short-Term Spectrum Manager Lease Agreement. 
 
 The strategic alternatives review process is ongoing as UScellular seeks to opportunistically monetize its spectrum assets that are not subject to the Securities Purchase Agreement or the Verizon Purchase Agreement. 
 
 UScellular incurred third-party expenses related to the announced transactions and strategic alternatives review of 7 million and 28 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and 3 million for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Significant Financial Matter 
 Net loss attributable to UScellular shareholders was 79 million and 44 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. Such net losses include a non-cash charge related to the impairment of certain wireless spectrum licenses in the amount of 136 million 102 million, net of tax impacts), which was recorded during the three months ended September 30, 2024. The conclusion that this impairment was required was made in connection with the review and preparation of the September 30, 2024 financial statements. See Note 8 Intangible Assets for a detailed discussion regarding this impairment. Refer to Supplemental Information to Non-GAAP Financial Measures within this MD A for a reconciliation of the wireless spectrum license impairment, net of tax.

 (Dollars in millions) 

Operating Revenues 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 (Dollars in millions) 

Service revenues consist of: 
 Retail Service - Postpaid and prepaid charges for voice, data and value-added services and cost recovery surcharges 
 Other Service - Amounts received from the Federal USF, inbound roaming, miscellaneous other service revenues and Internet of Things (IoT) 
 Equipment revenues consist of : 
 Sales of wireless devices and related accessories to new and existing customers, agents, and third-party distributors 
 
 Key components of changes in the statement of operations line items were as follows: 
 Total operating revenues 
 Retail service revenues decreased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily as a result of a decrease in average postpaid and prepaid connections, partially offset by an increase in Postpaid ARPU as previously discussed in the Operational Overview section. 
 Equipment sales revenues decreased for the three months ended September 30, 2024, due primarily to a decline in smartphone devices sold due to lower upgrades. 
 Equipment sales revenues decreased for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, due primarily to a decline in smartphone devices sold due to lower upgrades and gross additions, partially offset by a higher average price of new smartphone sales. 
 Wireless service providers have been aggressive promotionally and on price to attract and retain customers. This includes both traditional carriers and cable wireless companies. UScellular expects promotional aggressiveness by traditional carriers to continue and pricing pressures from cable wireless companies and new entrants to increase into the foreseeable future. Additionally, other wireless service providers have more developed networks and coverage as well as lower costs per subscriber than UScellular, which has negatively affected and may continue to negatively affect UScellular's ability to compete over time. Operating revenues and Operating income (loss) have been negatively impacted by these factors in current and prior periods, and are expected to be negatively impacted in future periods.

 Key components of changes in the statement of operations line items were as follows: 
 Intra-company revenues 
 Intra-company revenues increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily as a result of an increase in the intra-company rate charged by Towers to Wireless and an increase in the number of owned towers. 
 Upon closing of the transaction to dispose of the wireless operations and select spectrum assets to T-Mobile, UScellular expects an increase in Third-party revenues that will be recognized under the Master License Agreement that will go into effect under the Securities Purchase Agreement. However, at such time Intra-company revenues would cease, resulting in significantly lower Total tower revenues in periods following the close.

 Total operating expenses 
 Total operating expenses increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 due primarily to increases in System operations expenses as a result of increases in cell site ground rent and maintenance expenses. 
 Upon closing of the transaction to dispose of the wireless operations and select spectrum assets to T-Mobile, UScellular expects expenses may be incurred to effect the separation including costs to decommission certain towers and record remaining ground lease obligations on such decommissioned towers. These factors and other uncertainties in how the ongoing tower operations will be supported in the long-term may significantly impact operating expenses recorded in periods following the close.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Sources of Liquidity 
 UScellular operates a capital-intensive business. In the past, UScellular s existing cash and investment balances, funds available under its financing agreements, and cash flows from operating and certain investing and financing activities, including sales of assets or businesses, provided sufficient liquidity and financial flexibility for UScellular to meet its day-to-day operating needs and debt service requirements, to finance the build-out and enhancement of markets and to fund wireless spectrum license acquisitions. There is no assurance that this will be the case in the future. UScellular has incurred negative free cash flow at times in past periods, and this could occur in future periods. 
 UScellular believes that existing cash and investment balances, funds available under its financing agreements, its ability to obtain future external financing, potential dispositions and expected cash flows from operating and investing activities will provide sufficient liquidity for UScellular to meet its day-to-day operating needs and debt service requirements. UScellular may require substantial additional funding for, among other uses, capital expenditures, agreements to purchase goods or services, leases, repurchases of shares, or making additional investments. It may be necessary from time to time to increase the size of its existing credit facilities, to amend existing or put in place new credit agreements, to obtain other forms of financing, issue equity securities, or to divest assets in order to fund potential expenditures. UScellular will continue to monitor the rapidly changing business and market conditions and is taking and intends to take appropriate actions, as necessary, to meet its liquidity needs. Due to its smaller scale, UScellular has higher costs per subscriber than its competitors and is balancing the timing of investments, such as its 5G deployment, with liquidity considerations. 
 Cash and Cash Equivalents 
 Cash and cash equivalents include cash and money market investments. The primary objective of UScellular's Cash and cash equivalents investment activities is to preserve principal. 

Cash and Cash Equivalents 
 (Dollars in millions) 

The majority of UScellular s Cash and cash equivalents are held in bank deposit accounts and in money market funds that purchase only debt issued by the U.S. Treasury or U.S. government agencies. Refer to the Consolidated Cash Flow Analysis for additional information related to changes in Cash and cash equivalents. 

In addition to Cash and cash equivalents, UScellular had available undrawn borrowing capacity from the following debt facilities at September 30, 2024. See the Financing section below for further details. 
 (Dollars in millions) Revolving Credit Agreement 300 Receivables Securitization Agreement 448 Total available undrawn borrowing capacity 748

 Financing 
 Receivables Securitization Agreement 
 UScellular, through its subsidiaries, has a receivables securitization agreement that permits securitized borrowings using its equipment installment plan receivable s. Amounts under the agreement may be borrowed, repaid and reborrowed from time to time until September 2025. Unless the agreement is amended to extend the maturity date, repayments based on receivable collections commence in October 2025. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, UScellular borrowed 40 million and repaid 188 million under the agreement. As of September 30, 2024, the outstanding borrowings under the agreement were 2 million and the unused borrowing capacity was 448 million, subject to sufficient collateral to satisfy the asset borrowing base provisions of the agreement. 
 Term Loan Agreements 
 In October 2024, UScellular repaid 40 million under its term loan agreement due July 2026. 
 Debt Covenants 
 The revolving credit agreement, term loan agreements, export credit financing agreement and receivables securitization agreement require UScellular to comply with certain affirmative and negative covenants, which include certain financial covenants that may restrict the borrowing capacity available. UScellular is required to maintain the Consolidated Leverage Ratio as of the end of any fiscal quarter at a level not to exceed the following: 4.00 to 1.00 from April 1, 2024 through March 31, 2025; 3.75 to 1.00 from April 1, 2025 and thereafter. UScellular is also required to maintain the Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio at a level not lower than 3.00 to 1.00 as of the end of any fiscal quarter. UScellular believes that it was in compliance as of September 30, 2024 with all such financial covenants. 
 Other Long-Term Financing 
 UScellular has an effective shelf registration statement on Form S-3 to issue senior or subordinated debt securities, preferred shares and depositary shares. 
 See Note 11 Debt in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to the financing agreements. 
 Credit Ratings 
 Following the execution of the Securities Purchase Agreement in May 2024, Moody s placed UScellular's issuer credit rating on a review for downgrade. There was no change to the Ba1 rating issued by Moody s in October 2023. At the same time, Fitch Ratings placed UScellular s issuer credit rating on rating watch negative. There was no change to the BB+ rating issued by Fitch Ratings in October 2023. There was no change to the Standard Poor s credit rating or outlook. 
 Capital Expenditures 
 Capital expenditures (i.e., additions to property, plant and equipment and system development expenditures; excludes wireless spectrum license additions), which include the effects of accruals and capitalized interest, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, were as follows: 

Capital Expenditures 
 (Dollars in millions) 

Capital expenditures for the full year 2024 are expected to be between 550 million and 600 million. These expenditures are expected to be used principally for the following purposes: 
 Continued deployment of 5G with a focus on network deployment that uses mid-band spectrum to provide additional speed and capacity to accommodate increased data usage by current customers; and 
 Invest in information technology to support existing and new services and products. 

UScellular intends to finance its capital expenditures for 2024 using primarily Cash flows from operating activities, existing cash balances and, as required, additional debt financing from its existing agreements and/or other forms of available financing.

 Consolidated Cash Flow Analysis 
 UScellular operates a capital-intensive business. UScellular makes substantial investments to acquire wireless spectrum licenses and to construct and upgrade wireless telecommunications networks and facilities with a goal of creating long-term value for shareholders. In recent years, rapid changes in technology and new opportunities have required substantial investments in potentially revenue enhancing and cost-saving upgrades to UScellular s networks. Revenues from certain of these investments are long-term and in some cases are uncertain. To meet its cash-flow needs, UScellular may need to delay or reduce certain investments or sell assets. Refer to Liquidity and Capital Resources within this MD A and Note 7 Divestitures in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Cash flows may fluctuate from quarter to quarter and year to year due to seasonality, timing and other factors. The following discussion summarizes UScellular's cash flow activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 2024 Commentary 
 UScellular s Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash increased 109 million. Net cash provided by operating activities was 761 million due to net loss of 37 million adjusted for non-cash items of 600 million, distributions received from unconsolidated entities of 106 million, including 37 million in distributions from the LA Partnership, and changes in working capital items which increased net cash by 92 million. The working capital changes were primarily driven by reduced receivable and inventory balances and the timing of future tax payments, partially offset by payments of associate bonuses and agent rebates and commissions. 
 Cash flows used for investing activities were 415 million, due primarily to payments for property, plant and equipment of 399 million. 
 Cash flows used for financing activities were 237 million, due primarily to 188 million in repayments on the receivables securitization agreement, cash paid for software license agreements of 31 million and the repurchase of 26 million Common Shares, partially offset by a borrowing of 40 million on the receivables securitization agreement. 
 2023 Commentary 
 UScellular s Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash decreased 123 million. Net cash provided by operating activities was 719 million due to net income of 43 million adjusted for non-cash items of 514 million, distributions received from unconsolidated entities of 97 million, including 37 million in distributions from the LA Partnership, and changes in working capital items which increased net cash by 65 million. The working capital changes were primarily driven by reduced inventory and receivable balances, partially offset by timing of vendor payments and payment of associate bonuses. 
 Cash flows used for investing activities were 464 million, due primarily to payments for property, plant and equipment of 454 million. 
 Cash flows used for financing activities were 378 million, due primarily to repayments of 385 million on the receivables securitization agreement, a 60 million repayment on the EIP receivables repurchase agreement and cash paid for software license agreements of 28 million, partially offset by 115 million borrowed under the receivables securitization agreement.

 Consolidated Balance Sheet Analysis 
 The following discussion addresses certain captions in the consolidated balance sheet and changes therein. This discussion is intended to highlight the significant changes and is not intended to fully reconcile the changes. Notable balance sheet changes during 2024 were as follows: 
 Inventory, net 
 Inventory, net decreased 38 million due primarily to the sell through of inventory on hand which was elevated at the end of 2023 to support holiday promotions and ensure adequate device supply. 
 Property, plant and equipment 
 The gross basis of Property, plant and equipment as well as the related Accumulated depreciation and amortization, decreased by 1,158 million and 1,086 million, respectively, due primarily to the decommissioning of fully depreciated assets no longer in service related to the CDMA network shutdown. 
 Accrued taxes 
 Accrued taxes increased 31 million due primarily to an increase in federal tax liability, as UScellular projects taxable income in 2024 to exceed its available federal net operating loss carryforward from previous years. 
 Other current liabilities 
 Other current liabilities decreased 30 million due primarily to decreases in agent rebate and commission liabilities as a result of lower sales volume and payments of Auction 107 relocation fees.

 Supplemental Information Relating to Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 UScellular sometimes uses information derived from consolidated financial information but not presented in its financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP to evaluate the performance of its business. Specifically, UScellular has referred to the following measures in this report: 
 EBITDA 
 Adjusted EBITDA 
 Adjusted OIBDA 
 Free cash flow 
 Licenses impairment, net of tax 
 
 These measures are considered non-GAAP financial measures under U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Rules. Following are explanations of each of these measures. 
 EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted OIBDA 
 EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted OIBDA are defined as Net income (loss) adjusted for the items set forth in the reconciliation below. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted OIBDA are not measures of financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as alternatives to Net income (loss) or Cash flows from operating activities, as indicators of cash flows or as measures of liquidity. UScellular does not intend to imply that any such items set forth in the reconciliation below are non-recurring, infrequent or unusual; such items may occur in the future. 
 Adjusted EBITDA is a segment measure reported to the chief operating decision maker for purposes of assessing the segments' performance. See Note 13 Business Segment Information in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 
 Management uses Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted OIBDA as measurements of profitability, and therefore reconciliations to applicable GAAP income measures are deemed appropriate. Management believes Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted OIBDA are useful measures of UScellular s operating results before significant recurring non-cash charges, nonrecurring expenses, gains and losses, and other items as presented below as they provide additional relevant and useful information to investors and other users of UScellular s financial data in evaluating the effectiveness of its operations and underlying business trends in a manner that is consistent with management s evaluation of business performance. Adjusted EBITDA shows adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and accretion, gains and losses, and expenses related to the strategic alternatives review of UScellular, while Adjusted OIBDA reduces this measure further to exclude Equity in earnings of unconsolidated entities and Interest and dividend income in order to more effectively show the performance of operating activities excluding investment activities. The following tables reconcile EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted OIBDA to the corresponding GAAP measures, Net income (loss) and/or Operating income (loss). Income and expense items below Operating income (loss) are not provided at the individual segment level for Wireless and Towers; therefore, the reconciliations begin with EBITDA and the most directly comparable GAAP measure is Operating income (loss) rather than Net income (loss) at the segment level.

 Free Cash Flow 
 The following table presents Free cash flow, which is defined as Cash flows from operating activities less Cash paid for additions to property, plant and equipment and Cash paid for software license agreements. Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure which UScellular believes may be useful to investors and other users of its financial information in evaluating liquidity, specifically, the amount of net cash generated by business operations after deducting Cash paid for additions to property, plant and equipment and Cash paid for software license agreements.

 Application of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 UScellular prepares its consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP. UScellular s significant accounting policies are discussed in detail in Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, Note 2 Revenue Recognition and Note 10 Leases in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in UScellular's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. UScellular s application of critical accounting policies and estimates is discussed in detail in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, included in UScellular s Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 and updated below based on developments since the UScellular Form 10-K was filed. 
 Wireless Spectrum License Impairment 
 Wireless spectrum licenses represent a significant component of UScellular s consolidated assets. Wireless spectrum licenses are considered to be indefinite-lived assets, and therefore, are not amortized but are tested for impairment annually or more frequently if there are events or circumstances that cause UScellular to believe that their carrying values exceed their fair values. Wireless spectrum licenses are tested for impairment at the level of reporting referred to as a unit of accounting. 
 As a result of executing the Securities Purchase Agreement with T-Mobile during the second quarter of 2024, UScellular bifurcated its historical single unit of accounting into two units of accounting wireless spectrum licenses to be sold under the Securities Purchase Agreement and wireless spectrum licenses to be retained. During the third quarter of 2024, UScellular s efforts to monetize its spectrum assets not subject to the Securities Purchase Agreement provided new evidence that the highest and best use of the retained spectrum to current buyers would be in separate tranches. As a result, UScellular further divided its wireless spectrum licenses units of accounting from one retained unit into eleven units, resulting in twelve total units of accounting. UScellular concluded that there were events and circumstances in the third quarter of 2024 that caused UScellular to believe the carrying values of five of the units of accounting may exceed their respective fair values (i.e. triggering event), and accordingly a quantitative impairment assessment was performed for those units. There was no triggering event for the other units of accounting. 
 A market approach was used for purposes of the quantitative impairment assessment to value the wireless spectrum licenses for the five units tested, using a range of values established largely through industry benchmarks, FCC auction data, and precedent transactions. The midpoint of the range was established as the estimate of fair value for each unit of accounting. Based on this valuation, the fair value of the wireless spectrum licenses exceeded their respective carrying values by amounts ranging from 9 to 80 for three of the units of accounting. For two of the units of accounting, the fair value of the wireless spectrum licenses was less than the respective carrying value, and a million impairment was recorded to Loss on impairment of licenses in the Consolidated Statement of Operations within UScellular s Wireless segment during the third quarter of 2024. The impairment loss was substantially all related to the retained high-band spectrum unit of accounting which includes the 28 GHz, 37 GHz and 39 GHz frequency bands, the carrying value of which was 161 million as of September 30, 2024 after the impairment loss. The impairment loss is driven by the change in the units of accounting described above combined with lower fair value primarily attributed to high-band spectrum as a result of industry-wide challenges encountered related to the operationalization of this spectrum.

 Announced Transactions and Strategic Alternatives Review Risk Factors 
 TDS and UScellular entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement dated as of May 24, 2024 with T-Mobile and USCC Wireless Holdings, LLC, pursuant to which, among other things, UScellular has agreed to sell its wireless operations and select spectrum assets to T-Mobile. In addition, UScellular, and certain subsidiaries of UScellular, entered into the Verizon Purchase Agreement on October 17, 2024 to sell certain wireless spectrum licenses. There is no guarantee that the transactions contemplated by the Securities Purchase Agreement or the Verizon Purchase Agreement will be able to be consummated or that UScellular will be able to find buyers at mutually agreeable prices for its spectrum assets not subject to the Securities Purchase Agreement or the Verizon Purchase Agreement. 
 Operational Risk Factors 
 Intense competition involving products, services, pricing, promotions and network speed and technologies could adversely affect UScellular s revenues or increase its costs to compete. 
 UScellular s smaller scale relative to larger competitors that may have greater financial and other resources than UScellular has caused and could continue to cause UScellular to be unable to compete successfully, which has adversely affected and could continue to adversely affect its business, financial condition or results of operations. 
 Changes in roaming practices or other factors could cause UScellular's roaming revenues to decline from current levels, roaming expenses to increase from current levels and/or impact UScellular's ability to service its customers in geographic areas where UScellular does not have its own network, which could have an adverse effect on UScellular's business, financial condition or results of operations. 
 An inability to attract diverse people of outstanding talent throughout all levels of the organization, to develop their potential through education and assignments, and to retain them by keeping them engaged, challenged and properly rewarded could have an adverse effect on UScellular's business, financial condition or results of operations. 
 Changes in various business factors, including changes in demand, consumer preferences and perceptions, price competition, churn from customer switching activity and other factors, could have an adverse effect on UScellular s business, financial condition or results of operations. 
 A failure by UScellular to obtain access to adequate radio spectrum to meet current or anticipated future needs and/or to accurately predict future needs for radio spectrum could have an adverse effect on UScellular s business, financial condition or results of operations. 
 Advances or changes in technology could render certain technologies used by UScellular obsolete, could put UScellular at a competitive disadvantage, could reduce UScellular s revenues or could increase its costs of doing business. 
 Complexities associated with deploying new technologies present substantial risk and UScellular investments in unproven technologies may not produce the benefits that UScellular expects. 
 Costs, integration problems or other factors associated with acquisitions, divestitures or exchanges of properties or wireless spectrum licenses and/or expansion of UScellular s business could have an adverse effect on UScellular s business, financial condition or results of operations.

Table of Contents 

 A failure by UScellular to complete significant network construction and systems implementation activities as part of its plans to improve the quality, coverage, capabilities and capacity of its network, support and other systems and infrastructure could have an adverse effect on its operations. 
 Difficulties involving third parties with which UScellular does business, including changes in UScellular's relationships with or financial or operational difficulties, including supply chain disruptions, of key suppliers or independent agents and third-party national retailers who market UScellular s services, could adversely affect UScellular's business, financial condition or results of operations. 
 A failure by UScellular to maintain flexible and capable telecommunication networks or information technologies, or a material disruption thereof, could have an adverse effect on UScellular s business, financial condition or results of operations. 
 Financial Risk Factors 
 Uncertainty in UScellular s or TDS' future cash flow and liquidity or the inability to access capital, deterioration in the capital markets, changes in interest rates, other changes in UScellular s or TDS' performance or market conditions, changes in UScellular s or TDS' credit ratings or other factors could limit or restrict the availability of financing on terms and prices acceptable to UScellular, which has required and could in the future require UScellular to reduce or delay its construction, development or acquisition programs, reduce the amount of wireless spectrum licenses acquired, divest assets or businesses, and/or reduce or cease share repurchases. 
 UScellular has a significant amount of indebtedness which could adversely affect its financial performance and in turn adversely affect its ability to make payments on its indebtedness, comply with terms of debt covenants and incur additional debt. 
 UScellular s assets and revenue are concentrated in the U.S. wireless telecommunications industry. Consequently, its operating results may fluctuate based on factors related primarily to conditions in this industry. 
 UScellular has significant investments in entities that it does not control. Losses in the value of such investments could have an adverse effect on UScellular s financial condition or results of operations. 
 Regulatory, Legal and Governance Risk Factors 
 Failure by UScellular to timely or fully comply with any existing applicable legislative and/or regulatory requirements or changes thereto could adversely affect UScellular s business, financial condition or results of operations. 
 UScellular receives significant regulatory support, and is also subject to numerous surcharges and fees from federal, state and local governments the applicability and the amount of the support and fees are subject to uncertainty, including the ability to pass through certain fees to customers, and this uncertainty could have an adverse effect on UScellular s business, financial condition or results of operations. 
 Settlements, judgments, restraints on its current or future manner of doing business and/or legal costs resulting from pending and future litigation could have an adverse effect on UScellular s business, financial condition or results of operations. 
 The possible development of adverse precedent in litigation or conclusions in professional or environmental studies to the effect that potentially harmful emissions from devices or network equipment, including but not limited to radio frequencies emitted by wireless signals, may cause harmful health or environmental consequences, including cancer, tumors or otherwise harmful impacts, or may interfere with various electronic medical devices or frequencies used by other industries, could have an adverse effect on UScellular's business, financial condition or results of operations. 
 Claims of infringement of intellectual property and proprietary rights of others, primarily involving patent infringement claims, could prevent UScellular from using necessary technology to provide products or services or subject UScellular to expensive intellectual property litigation or monetary penalties, which could have an adverse effect on UScellular s business, financial condition or results of operations. 
 There are potential conflicts of interests between TDS and UScellular. 
 Certain matters, such as control by TDS and provisions in the UScellular Restated Certificate of Incorporation, may serve to discourage or make more difficult a change in control of UScellular or have other consequences. 
 General Risk Factors 
 UScellular has experienced, and in the future expects to experience, cyber-attacks or other breaches of network or information technology security of varying degrees on a regular basis, which could have an adverse effect on UScellular's business, financial condition or results of operations. 
 Disruption in credit or other financial markets, a deterioration of U.S. or global economic conditions or other events could, among other things, impede UScellular s access to or increase the cost of financing its operating and investment activities and/or result in reduced revenues and lower operating income and cash flows, which would have an adverse effect on UScellular s business, financial condition or results of operations.

 Risk Factors 
 In addition to the information set forth in this Form 10-Q, you should carefully consider the factors discussed in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors in UScellular s Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, which could materially affect UScellular s business, financial condition or future results. The risks described in this Form 10-Q and the Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, may not be the only risks that could affect UScellular. Additional unidentified or unrecognized risks and uncertainties could materially adversely affect UScellular s business, financial condition and/or operating results. Subject to the foregoing and other than the risk factors set forth below, UScellular has not identified for disclosure any material changes to the risk factors as previously disclosed in UScellular's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 TDS and UScellular entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement dated as of May 24, 2024 with T-Mobile and USCC Wireless Holdings, LLC, pursuant to which, among other things, UScellular has agreed to sell its wireless operations and select spectrum assets to T-Mobile. In addition, UScellular, and certain subsidiaries of UScellular, entered into the Verizon Purchase Agreement on October 17, 2024 to sell certain wireless spectrum licenses. There is no guarantee that the transactions contemplated by the Securities Purchase Agreement or the Verizon Purchase Agreement will be able to be consummated or that UScellular will be able to find buyers at mutually agreeable prices for its spectrum assets not subject to the Securities Purchase Agreement or the Verizon Purchase Agreement. 
 On August 4, 2023, TDS and UScellular announced that the Boards of Directors of both companies decided to initiate a process to explore a range of strategic alternatives for UScellular. As part of this review, on May 28, 2024, UScellular announced that its Board of Directors unanimously approved the execution of the Securities Purchase Agreement pursuant to which, among other things, UScellular has agreed to sell its wireless operations and select spectrum assets to T-Mobile. The Securities Purchase Agreement also contemplates, among other things, a Short-Term Spectrum Manager Lease Agreement that will become effective at the closing date, which provides T-Mobile with an exclusive license to use certain UScellular spectrum assets at no cost for up to one-year for the purpose of providing continued, uninterrupted service to customers. 
 On October 17, 2024, UScellular, and certain subsidiaries of UScellular, entered into the Verizon Purchase Agreement to sell certain AWS, Cellular and PCS wireless spectrum licenses and agreed to grant Verizon certain rights to lease such licenses prior to the transaction close. 
 The transactions resulting from the strategic alternatives review are subject to regulatory approval, which UScellular may not be able to obtain on the terms or timeline currently contemplated, or at all. Similarly, UScellular may not be able to satisfy the other closing conditions applicable to each of the transactions, which in the case of the Verizon transaction include the closing of the T-Mobile transaction and the termination of the T-Mobile Short-Term Spectrum Manager Lease Agreement. In addition, UScellular may be unable to find buyers at mutually agreeable prices for its spectrum assets not subject to the Securities Purchase Agreement or the Verizon Purchase Agreement. 
 The uncertainty regarding the transactions and continued strategic alternatives review process could result in: a diversion of management's attention from UScellular's existing business; a failure to achieve financial and operating objectives; adverse effects on UScellular's financial condition or results of operations; a failure to retain key personnel, customers, business partners or contracts; and volatility in UScellular's stock price. 
 In addition, the strategic alternatives review process has already resulted in the incurrence of significant expense - this is expected to continue. The execution of the Securities Purchase Agreement impacted UScellular's units of accounting and asset groups for purposes of assessing wireless spectrum licenses and property, plant and equipment for impairment, but did not require an impairment assessment to be performed during the second quarter of 2024. During the third quarter of 2024, there were events and circumstances that impacted the units of accounting for purposes of assessing wireless spectrum licenses for impairment. UScellular performed a quantitative impairment assessment on certain units of accounting and recorded an impairment in the third quarter of 2024. There may be future events that could require an impairment assessment to be performed which may result in additional impairments. There can be no assurance that such comprehensive process, which is ongoing, will result in the transactions or any strategic alternative of any kind being successfully completed or that the process or any outcomes of the process will not have an adverse impact on UScellular's business or financial statements.

 UScellular receives significant regulatory support, and is also subject to numerous surcharges and fees from federal, state and local governments the applicability and the amount of the support and fees are subject to uncertainty, including the ability to pass through certain fees to customers, and this uncertainty could have an adverse effect on UScellular s business, financial condition or results of operations. 
 Telecommunications companies may be designated by states, or in some cases by the FCC, as an Eligible Telecommunications Carrier (ETC) to receive universal service support payments if they provide specified services in high-cost areas. UScellular has been designated as an ETC in certain states and received 92 million in high-cost support for service to high-cost areas in 2023. While there is uncertainty, UScellular expects regulatory support payments to decline in future periods, and there is no assurance that UScellular will qualify for future regulatory support programs. If regulatory support is discontinued or reduced from current levels, or if receipt of future regulatory support is contingent upon making certain network-related expenditures, this could have an adverse effect on UScellular s business, financial condition or operating results and cash flows. Adding to this uncertainty are a series of court cases challenging the constitutionality of the universal service fund program that establishes and administers these regulatory support payments. On July 24, 2024, differing from earlier decisions at the Sixth and Eleventh Circuits, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit sitting in en banc review ruled that the universal service fund program is unconstitutional as currently administered, and remanded the case to the FCC. The FCC has filed a petition for certiorari with the Supreme Court. In addition, a working group within Congress is considering legislative reform of the universal service funding program, but has not yet released legislative text. This ruling may have significant adverse effects on the funding that UScellular receives from programs like USF high-cost support. Additionally, the ruling may have significant adverse effects on federal government supported programs that many of UScellular s customers benefit from. 
 Telecommunications providers pay a variety of surcharges and fees on their gross revenues from interstate and intrastate services, including USF fees and common carrier regulatory fees. The division of services between interstate services and intrastate services, including the divisions associated with Federal USF fees, is a matter of interpretation and in the future may be contested by the FCC or state authorities. The FCC in the future also may change the basis on which Federal USF fees are charged. The Federal government and many states also apply transaction-based taxes to sales of telecommunications services and products and to purchases of telecommunications services from various carriers. In addition, state regulators and local governments have imposed and may continue to impose various surcharges, taxes and fees on telecommunications services. The applicability of these surcharges and fees to UScellular s services is uncertain in many cases and periodically, state and federal regulators may increase or change the surcharges and fees UScellular currently pays. In some instances, UScellular passes through these charges to its customers. However, Congress, the FCC, state regulatory agencies or state legislatures may limit the ability to pass through transaction-based tax liabilities, regulatory surcharges and regulatory fees imposed on UScellular to customers. UScellular may or may not be able to recover some or all of those taxes from its customers and the amount of taxes may deter demand for its services or increase its cost to provide service.

 million, which is payable in a combination of cash and the assumption of up to approximately million in debt. The Securities Purchase Agreement also contemplates, among other things, a Short-Term Spectrum Manager Lease Agreement that will become effective at the closing date, which provides T-Mobile with an exclusive license to use certain UScellular spectrum assets at no cost for up to one-year for the purpose of providing continued, uninterrupted service to customers. UScellular expects to present the wireless operations and select spectrum assets sold to T-Mobile as discontinued operations if and when the accounting criteria is met. The transactions are expected to close in mid-2025, subject to the receipt of regulatory approvals and the satisfaction of customary closing conditions. 
 On October 17, 2024, UScellular, and certain subsidiaries of UScellular, entered into a License Purchase Agreement (Verizon Purchase Agreement) with Verizon Communications Inc. (Verizon) to sell certain AWS, Cellular and PCS wireless spectrum licenses and agreed to grant Verizon certain rights to lease such licenses prior to the transaction close for total proceeds of million. As of September 30, 2024, the book value of the wireless spectrum licenses to be sold was million.

 asset groups wireless and towers. At that time, UScellular also assessed whether an impairment test of its long-lived assets was required and determined that there was no triggering event present due to the factors just described that required a recoverability test to be performed. In the third quarter of 2024, UScellular re-assessed whether an impairment test of its long-lived assets was required considering the wireless spectrum license impairment and determined that there was no triggering event that required a recoverability test to be performed.

There was no cash exchanged at the inception of the Put/Call Agreement. All license transfers pursuant to any put/call are subject to Federal Communications Commission (FCC) approval. UScellular accounts for this instrument as a net written call option and records such option at fair value each reporting period unless/until such option is exercised or terminated. UScellular estimated the fair value of the net written call option at million as of September 30, 2024, which was recorded to Other deferred liabilities and credits in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.

 units of accounting wireless spectrum licenses to be sold under the Securities Purchase Agreement and wireless spectrum licenses to be retained. During the third quarter of 2024, UScellular s efforts to monetize its spectrum assets not subject to the Securities Purchase Agreement provided new evidence that the highest and best use of the retained spectrum to current buyers would be in separate tranches. As a result, UScellular further divided its wireless spectrum licenses units of accounting from one retained unit into eleven units, resulting in total units of accounting. UScellular concluded that there were events and circumstances in the third quarter of 2024 that caused UScellular to believe the carrying values of five of the units of accounting may exceed their respective fair values (i.e. triggering event), and accordingly a quantitative impairment assessment was performed for those units. There was no triggering event for the other units of accounting. 
 A market approach was used for purposes of the quantitative impairment assessment to value the wireless spectrum licenses for the five units tested, using a range of values established largely through industry benchmarks, FCC auction data, and precedent transactions. The midpoint of the range was established as the estimate of fair value for each unit of accounting. Based on this valuation, the fair value of the wireless spectrum licenses exceeded their respective carrying values by amounts ranging from to for three of the units of accounting. For two of the units of accounting, the fair value of the wireless spectrum licenses was less than the respective carrying value, and a million impairment was recorded to Loss on impairment of licenses in the Consolidated Statement of Operations within UScellular s Wireless segment during the third quarter of 2024. The impairment loss was substantially all related to the retained high-band spectrum unit of accounting which includes the 28 GHz, 37 GHz and 39 GHz frequency bands, the carrying value of which was million as of September 30, 2024, after the impairment loss. The impairment loss is driven by the change in the units of accounting described above combined with lower fair value primarily attributed to high-band spectrum as a result of industry-wide challenges encountered related to the operationalization of this spectrum.

 . During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, UScellular borrowed million and repaid million under its receivables securitization agreement. As of September 30, 2024, the outstanding borrowings under the agreement were million and the unused borrowing capacity was million, subject to sufficient collateral to satisfy the asset borrowing base provisions of the agreement. As of September 30, 2024, the USCC Master Note Trust held million of assets available to be pledged as collateral for the receivables securitization agreement. 
 Term Loan Agreements 
 In October 2024, UScellular repaid million under its term loan agreement due July 2026. 
 Debt Covenants 
 The revolving credit agreement, term loan agreements, export credit financing agreement and receivables securitization agreement require UScellular to comply with certain affirmative and negative covenants, which include certain financial covenants that may restrict the borrowing capacity available. UScellular is required to maintain the Consolidated Leverage Ratio as of the end of any fiscal quarter at a level not to exceed the following: to 1.00 from April 1, 2024 through March 31, 2025; to 1.00 from April 1, 2025 and thereafter. UScellular is also required to maintain the Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio at a level not lower than to 1.00 as of the end of any fiscal quarter. UScellular believes that it was in compliance as of September 30, 2024 with all such financial covenants. 
 
 UScellular formed USCC EIP LLC (Seller/Sub-Servicer), USCC Receivables Funding LLC (Transferor) and the USCC Master Note Trust (Trust), collectively the special purpose entities (SPEs), to facilitate a securitized borrowing using its equipment installment plan receivables. Under a Receivables Sale Agreement, UScellular wholly-owned, majority-owned and unconsolidated entities, collectively referred to as affiliated entities , transfer device equipment installment plan contracts to the Seller/Sub-Servicer. The Seller/Sub-Servicer aggregates device equipment installment plan contracts, and performs servicing, collection and all other administrative activities related to accounting for the equipment installment plan contracts. The Seller/Sub-Servicer sells the eligible equipment installment plan receivables to the Transferor, a bankruptcy remote entity, which subsequently sells the receivables to the Trust. The Trust, which is bankruptcy remote and isolated from the creditors of UScellular, will be responsible for issuing asset-backed variable funding notes (Notes), which are collateralized by the equipment installment plan receivables owned by the Trust. Given that UScellular has the power to direct the activities of these SPEs, and that these SPEs lack sufficient equity to finance their activities, UScellular is deemed to have a controlling financial interest in the SPEs, and therefore consolidates them. All transactions with third parties (e.g., issuance of the asset-backed variable funding notes) will be accounted for as a secured borrowing due to the pledging of equipment installment plan contracts as collateral, significant continuing involvement in the transferred assets, subordinated interests of the cash flows, and continued evidence of control of the receivables. 
 The following VIEs were formed to participate in FCC auctions of wireless spectrum licenses and to fund, establish, and provide wireless service with respect to any FCC wireless spectrum licenses won in the auctions: 
 Advantage Spectrum, L.P. (Advantage Spectrum) and Sunshine Spectrum, Inc., the general partner of Advantage Spectrum; and 
 King Street Wireless, L.P. (King Street Wireless) and King Street Wireless, Inc., the general partner of King Street Wireless. 
 These particular VIEs are collectively referred to as designated entities. The power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of these VIEs is shared. Specifically, the general partner of these VIEs has the exclusive right to manage, operate and control the limited partnerships and make all decisions to carry on the business of the partnerships. The general partner of each partnership needs the consent of the limited partner, an indirect UScellular subsidiary, to sell or lease certain wireless spectrum licenses, to make certain large expenditures, admit other partners or liquidate the limited partnerships. Although the power to direct the activities of these VIEs is shared, UScellular has the most significant level of exposure to the variability associated with the economic performance of the VIEs, indicating that UScellular is the primary beneficiary of the VIEs. Therefore, in accordance with GAAP, these VIEs are consolidated into the UScellular financial statements.

 UScellular s total investment in these unconsolidated entities was million and million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, and is included in Investments in unconsolidated entities in UScellular s Consolidated Balance Sheet. The maximum exposure from unconsolidated VIEs is limited to the investment held by UScellular in those entities. 
 Other Related Matters 
 UScellular made contributions, loans or advances to its VIEs totaling million and million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, of which million in 2024 and million in 2023, are related to USCC EIP LLC as discussed above. UScellular may agree to make additional capital contributions and/or advances to these or other VIEs and/or to their general partners to provide additional funding for their operations or the development of wireless spectrum licenses granted in various auctions. UScellular may finance such amounts with a combination of cash on hand, borrowings under its revolving credit or receivables securitization agreements and/or other long-term debt. There is no assurance that UScellular will be able to obtain additional financing on commercially reasonable terms or at all to provide such financial support. 
 The limited partnership agreement of Advantage Spectrum also provided the general partner with a put option whereby the general partner may require the limite d partner, a subsidiary of UScellular, to purchase its interest in the limited partnership. The put option was not exercised during the exercise period .

 1 Income and expense items below Operating income are not provided at the individual segment level for Wireless and Towers. These items are not included in the evaluation of operating performance of the segments, and therefore are reported for "UScellular Total". 
 2 Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and accretion (Adjusted EBITDA) is a segment measure reported to the chief operating decision maker for purposes of assessing the segments' performance. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income, adjusted for the items set forth in the reconciliation above. UScellular believes Adjusted EBITDA is a useful measure of UScellular s operating results before significant recurring non-cash charges, gains and losses, and other items as presented above as it provides additional relevant and useful information to investors and other users of UScellular s financial data in evaluating the effectiveness of its operations and underlying business trends in a manner that is consistent with management's evaluation of business performance. 
 3 Assets are not provided at the individual segment level for Wireless and Towers. The segments operate under a common capital structure, and management has historically considered its assets collectively as part of a combined wireless network.

 Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 UScellular maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act)) that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in its reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is processed, recorded, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to UScellular s management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. 
 As required by SEC Rules 13a-15(b), UScellular carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of UScellular s disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report. Based on this evaluation, UScellular s principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that UScellular s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024, at the reasonable assurance level. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 There have been no changes in internal controls over financial reporting that have occurred during the three months ended September 30, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, UScellular s internal control over financial reporting. 
 
 Legal Proceedings 
 On May 2, 2023, a putative stockholder class action was filed against TDS and UScellular and certain current and former officers and directors in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. An Amended Complaint was filed on September 1, 2023, which names TDS, UScellular, and certain current UScellular officers and directors as defendants, and alleges that certain public statements made between May 6, 2022 and November 3, 2022 (the potential class period) regarding, among other things, UScellular s business strategies to address subscriber demand, violated Section 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The plaintiff seeks to represent a class of stockholders who purchased TDS equity securities during the potential class period and demands unspecified monetary damages. 
 On June 18, 2024, a stockholder derivative lawsuit was filed in the Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois, Chancery Division against UScellular, certain TDS and UScellular directors and officers, and nominal defendant TDS. The derivative lawsuit takes issue with the same public statements made between May 6, 2022 and November 3, 2022, alleging that the fact that the statements were made was a breach of fiduciary duty on the part of the officer and director defendants, and bringing claims for indemnification and contribution against the officer and director defendants and UScellular. In addition to indemnification and contribution, the plaintiff seeks money damages and the implementation of certain governance proposals. 
 UScellular is unable at this time to determine whether the outcome of these actions would have a material impact on its results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows. UScellular intends to contest plaintiffs claims vigorously on the merits. 
 Refer to the disclosure under Legal Proceedings in UScellular s Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, for additional information. Other than as described above, there have been no material changes to such information since December 31, 2023.

 Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds 
 In November 2009, UScellular announced by Form 8-K that the Board of Directors of UScellular authorized the repurchase of up to 1,300,000 additional Common Shares on an annual basis beginning in 2009 and continuing each year thereafter, on a cumulative basis. In December 2016, the UScellular Board amended this authorization to provide that, beginning on January 1, 2017, the increase in the authorized repurchase amount with respect to a particular year will be any amount from zero to 1,300,000 Common Shares, as determined by the Pricing Committee of the Board of Directors, and that if the Pricing Committee did not specify an additional amount for any year, such additional amount would be zero for such year. The Pricing Committee has not specified any increase in the authorization since that time. The Pricing Committee also was authorized to decrease the cumulative amount of the authorization at any time, but has not taken any action to do so at this time. The authorization provides that share repurchases will be made pursuant to open market purchases, block purchases in compliance with Rule 10b-18 of the Exchange Act or Rule 10b5-1 of the Exchange Act, or pursuant to accelerated share repurchase arrangements, prepaid share repurchases, private purchases, or otherwise, depending on market prices and other conditions. This authorization does not have an expiration date. UScellular did not determine to terminate the foregoing Common Share repurchase program, as amended, or cease making further purchases thereunder, during the third quarter of 2024. 
 The following table provides certain information with respect to all purchases made by or on behalf of UScellular, and any open market purchases made by any "affiliated purchaser" (as defined by the SEC) of UScellular, of UScellular Common Shares during the quarter covered by this Form 10-Q. The purchases below were made under a Rule 10b5-1 stock repurchase plan.

 Other Information 
 Executive Severance Policy 
 On October 29, 2024, UScellular adopted a cash severance policy applicable to its executive officers (the Executive Severance Policy that makes them eligible to receive severance pay in the event that their employment is terminated as a result of an involuntary separation without cause. In that event, subject to their execution and non-revocation of a release of claims in favor of UScellular and its parent and affiliates, they will be entitled to receive severance pay in a lump sum cash payment equal to one year of base pay at the time of separation. The Executive Severance Policy also provides UScellular with the discretion to provide the executive officers with additional benefits (e.g., prorated annual bonuses). The current executive officers subject to this policy are Douglas Chambers, Kevin Lowell and Michael Irizarry. Laurent Therivel s compensation agreement, which addresses severance and has been previously disclosed, overrides the Executive Severance Policy in the event an involuntary termination of his employment. 
 For purposes of the Executive Severance Policy, an involuntary separation without cause is defined as the elimination of the executive officer s position due to a strategic organizational change, such as a reduction in force, outsourcing or other restructuring where such executive officer has not been offered a position that is similar and/or comparably compensated with UScellular or with a new functional owner (whether or not such owner is affiliated with UScellular). If the executive officer accepts a similar position with the parent or an affiliate of UScellular that remains part of the same controlled group as Telephone and Data Systems, Inc., the executive officer will be eligible for severance under and subject to the terms of the Executive Severance Policy if their employment is involuntarily terminated within one year following the change of employer. 
 The Executive Severance Policy can be modified, altered or terminated at the Chairman s discretion at any time for any reason. 
 The foregoing summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Executive Severance Policy, attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1 and incorporated herein by reference. 
 Rule 10b5-1 Trading Arrangements 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, none of UScellular s directors or officers (as defined in Rule 16a-1(f) under the Exchange Act) has or a Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement or a non-Rule 10b5 1 trading arrangement (each as defined in Item 408 of Regulation S-K under the 1934 Act).

Exhibit 10.1 
 COMPENSATION DUE AT TIME OF SEPARATION FOR EXECUTIVE OFFICERS 
 
 PURPOSE 
 The purpose of this UScellular severance program is to provide severance pay, as described below, to eligible executive officers of United States Cellular Corporation USCC whose employment is involuntarily terminated by UScellular under certain limited circumstances. 
 
 PROVISIONS 
 Officers of USCC who are (1) executive officers of USCC within the meaning of Rule 3b-7 under the Securities Exchange Act and (2) employed by USCC or a subsidiary thereof (collectively, UScellular (each, an executive officer or EO will be eligible to receive the following compensation at the time of an involuntary separation without cause provided that all of the other terms of this policy are complied with 
 
 Severance pay equal to one year of base pay at the time of separation, excluding bonuses and incentives (cash or equity), benefits, perquisites and any other type of special pay. 
 
 Under certain circumstances, UScellular will consider supplementing this schedule with discretionary amounts and benefits such as an EO s estimated COBRA premiums, if any, for the same time period covered by severance pay, prorated annual bonus and outplacement services. UScellular has no obligation to provide these supplements. 
 
 At termination, EOs also are entitled to all base pay through the last day worked and any unused accrued vacation pay. Please refer to UScellular s Long-Term Incentive LTI Plan and any related agreements for information on the impact of the termination on any unvested performance share, restricted stock unit or other equity awards. 
 
 For purposes of this policy, an involuntary separation without cause is defined as an involuntary termination by UScellular due to a strategic organizational change, such as a reduction in force, outsourcing or other restructuring, that results in the elimination of the EO s position at UScellular provided , however , that an involuntary termination without cause shall not include any separations where the EO is offered a position that is similar and or comparably compensated with UScellular or with a new functional owner (whether a parent or affiliate of UScellular, an entity that acquires all or part of UScellular s business, or an entity to which UScellular outsources any service). Should the EO accept a similar position with the parent or an affiliate of UScellular that remains part of the TDS controlled group, the EO shall be eligible for severance from UScellular in accordance with the terms of this policy should, within one year following the transfer of their employment to the parent or affiliate of UScellular, the EO be terminated under conditions that would have entitled the EO to severance hereunder had the EO remained employed and been terminated by UScellular for the same reason. 
 This policy does not apply to separations for other reasons, including the following 
 separation for cause or unsatisfactory performance (as determined by UScellular) 
 refusal to accept or be reassigned to a position that is similar and or comparably compensated within UScellular or UScellular s parent, affiliates or successors 
 death or disability 
 termination upon or in connection with the sale of any of the stock or assets of UScellular, including a subsidiary, business unit or division of UScellular, provided that the EO is offered a position that is similar and or comparably compensated 
 termination as the result of UScellular outsourcing a portion of its business, provided that the EO is offered a position that is similar and or comparably compensated 
 the EO voluntarily leaves employment for any reason, including retirement 
 the EO voluntarily leaves employment prior to the date UScellular specifies as the EO s termination date or fails to satisfactorily meet performance expectations through that date. 
 
 For all purposes of this policy, UScellular shall determine whether a position is similar and or comparably compensated. 1 
 
 For the avoidance of doubt, a change in control or other corporate transaction involving UScellular does not result in severance under this policy unless it results in an eligible separation as described above. 
 
 1 For the avoidance of doubt, any employment offer from T-Mobile US, Inc. or an affiliate thereof to an employee of UScellular that complies with the terms of that certain Securities Purchase Agreement, dated as of May 24, 2024, by and among Telephone and Data Systems, Inc., United States Cellular Corporation, USCC Wireless Holdings, LLC and T-Mobile US, Inc., as it may be amended or supplemented, shall be considered an offer of a position that is similar and or comparably compensated for all purposes of this program. 

The severance payment will be contingent upon the EO signing, dating and returning within the specified time period (and not revoking) a separation agreement and general release of claims against UScellular and its parent and affiliates that will describe in detail the components of the severance package as well as all associate rights. 
 
 Eligible EOs will receive severance pay in a lump sum as soon as practicable after their separation date (but in no event later than March 15 of the calendar year following the calendar year in which the eligible EO s separation date occurs). Severance payments will be reduced by any tax withholdings required or permitted by law or authorized by the EO. 
 
 If an eligible EO receives severance pursuant to this policy and is subsequently rehired by UScellular or by another company in the TDS controlled group, the EO must repay any amounts which result in him her them being paid for both severance and salary at the same time (determined as if the severance had been paid as salary continuation rather than in a lump sum payment). UScellular, its parent or affiliate reserves the right to specify a start date for any rehire situation. 
 
 If UScellular separates any EO who has a valid, written contract addressing severance, any applicable terms regarding severance stipulated in the contract overrides this policy and this policy does not apply. In addition, EOs are ineligible for severance under any other severance policy, including Policy No. 701-2 UScellular s Compensation Due at Time of Separation Policy and Policy No. 701-2(a) UScellular s Compensation Due at Time of Separation Policy for Certain Officers. 
 
 Each payment of severance and any other payment pursuant to this Policy 701-2(b) shall constitute a separately identified amount within the meaning of Treasury Reg. 1.409A-2(b)(2). 
 
 ADMINISTRATIVE RESPONSIBILITIES 
 The Human Resources department administers all severance payments. 
 
 Leaders must obtain approval on all severance payments from the Human Resources Department prior to taking any termination actions. This approval must be obtained in a timely manner. Any requests for an exception to this policy must be approved by the Chairman of UScellular (the Chairman ), and will be conditioned on the EO complying with the other terms of this policy, including the execution of the appropriate separation agreement and general release form. 
 
 The Chairman reserves the right to supplement the severance schedule in extraordinary situations. The Chairman must approve all requests to supplement this policy. A decision to supplement the severance with respect to an EO shall not obligate UScellular to supplement the severance with respect to any other EO. 
 
 The Chairman reserves the right, in his sole discretion, to interpret the terms of this policy and to determine whether any EO will receive severance pay, and decisions by the Chairman under this policy shall be final, binding and conclusive with respect to all parties. The Chairman may modify, amend or terminate this policy at any time and for any reason, with or without advance notice to any party.
