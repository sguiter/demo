The following Management s Discussion and Analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes and Management s Discussion and Analysis included in our Annual Report on
 Form 10-K for the 2023 fiscal year, and our other reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission through the date of this Quarterly Report.

Overview

Revenue for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 decreased 14 to 430.1 million, compared to 498.8 million in the prior-year period, and revenue for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024
 decreased 13 to 1.3 billion, compared to 1.5 billion in the prior-year period. Our revenue in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 was negatively impacted 3.4 and 3.8 , respectively, from foreign-currency fluctuations. Our Customers,
 Paid Affiliates and Sales Leaders declined 15 , 20 and 19 , respectively, on a year-over-year basis.

The declines in our third quarter and first nine months of 2024 revenue were largely driven by continued macroeconomic pressures we have been facing in our core Nu Skin segments, which have negatively impacted
 consumer spending and customer acquisition. In addition, while we continue to make progress on our long-term vision, we have experienced headwinds from the transformation process. The declines in our core Nu Skin segments were partially offset by
 20.9 and 34.3 growth for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, in our Rhyz segments, partially from acquisitions in the second quarter of 2023 as well as organic growth. Rhyz is a key component of our business, and we
 anticipate its continued growth in the coming years both on an absolute basis and as a percentage of our consolidated revenue. These companies enable us to diversify our revenue mix, serve more customers where they shop, and create synergies for
 our owned and partner brands. In the fourth quarter, we are beginning to introduce our new sales performance plan, which we believe combines the best of affiliate marketing and leadership incentives to activate our existing sales force and excite
 potential new prospects. The plan is placing an enhanced focus on upfront earnings to help attract and retain new affiliates.

Earnings per share for the third quarter of 2024 increased to 0.17, compared to (0.74) in the prior-year period. Earnings per share for the first
 nine months of 2024 decreased to (2.23), compared to 0.03 in the prior-year period. The increase in earnings per share for the third quarter is primarily driven by a third quarter of 2023 inventory write-off charge of 65.7 million, partially
 offset by a decline in revenue. The decrease in earnings per share for the first nine months of 2024 is primarily driven by second quarter of 2024 restructuring and impairment charges of 149.4 million, along with the overall decline in revenue,
 partially offset by the third quarter of 2023 inventory write-off charge.

Constant-currency revenue change is a non-GAAP financial measure. See Non-GAAP Financial Measures, below.

The following table sets forth segment contribution for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 for each of our reportable segments (U.S. dollars in thousands). Segment contribution
 excludes certain intercompany charges, specifically royalties, license fees, transfer pricing and other miscellaneous items. We use segment contribution to measure the portion of profitability that the segment managers have the ability to control
 for their respective segments. The prior year segment contribution has been recast due to a change in how we allocate certain corporate costs. Consolidated financial information was not affected. For additional information regarding our segments
 and the calculation of segment contribution, see Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements contained in this report.

Table of Contents 

The following tables provide information concerning the number of Customers, Paid Affiliates and Sales Leaders in our core Nu Skin business for the three-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

Customers are persons who have purchased directly from the Company during the three months ended as of the date indicated. Our Customer numbers include members of our sales force who made such a purchase, including Paid Affiliates and
 those who qualify as Sales Leaders, but they do not include consumers who purchase directly from members of our sales force.

Paid Affiliates are any Brand Affiliates, as well as members of our sales force in Mainland China, who earned sales compensation during the three-month period. In all of our markets besides Mainland China, we refer to members of our
 independent sales force as Brand Affiliates because their primary role is to promote our brand and products through their personal social networks.

Sales Leaders are the three-month average of our monthly Brand Affiliates, as well as sales employees and independent marketers in Mainland China, who achieved certain qualification requirements as of the end of each month of the
 quarter.

The September 30, 2024 number is affected by a change in eligibility requirements for receiving certain rewards within our compensation structure,
 to more narrowly focus on those affiliates who are actively building a consumer base. See Japan and Southeast Asia/Pacific, below. We plan to implement these changes in additional segments over the next several quarters.

22 

Table of Contents 

Following is a narrative discussion of our results in each segment, which supplements the tables above.

Americas . The results in our Americas segment reflect a continued decline in momentum in our North America markets, while our Latin America markets continue to be challenged by macroeconomic issues. In connection
 with our transformation efforts, we also have experienced disruptions to our subscription sales in North America, which negatively impacted revenue. In addition, our reported revenue reflects a negative impact from unfavorable foreign
 currency fluctuations of 15.9 and 9.0 for the three- and nine-month periods, respectively. Our 2024 revenue has benefited from new product launches; in the first quarter of 2024, we launched our new connected device, which generated
 approximately 27.8 million in revenue for the first nine months of 2024, and in the third quarter of 2024, we launched our new ageLOC
 TruFace Peptide Retinol Complex with advanced peptide technology and MYND360, our new brand taking a holistic approach to support cognitive health, which generated a total of approximately 4.8 million of revenue during the quarter. We are introducing a new sales performance plan in North America starting in
 November 2024. 

In the second quarter of 2024, we launched our developing market strategy in Argentina, with a revised operating model with a focused product portfolio
 and modified business model that has enabled us to reach a broader demographic. During the third quarter of 2024, our Argentina market revenue, Customers and Sales Leaders all experienced double-digit growth year-over-year.

The year-over-year decline in segment contribution for the third quarter of 2024 primarily reflects the decrease in revenue partially offset by a 2.3 percentage point improvement in selling expenses
 from product mix and growth in our developing markets. The year-over-year decline in segment contribution for the first nine months of 2024 primarily reflects the decrease in revenue.

Southeast Asia/Pacific . The decline in revenue, Customers,
 Paid Affiliates and Sales Leaders for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 is partially attributable to slowing momentum from the general macroeconomic factors in the markets along with price increases that we implemented in 2022 and
 2023 to address inflation. During the second quarter of 2024, we began to see year-over-year improvements in many of our markets, but our Indonesia market remains challenging. Our Paid Affiliates were negatively impacted by a change in
 eligibility requirements in our Pacific markets for receiving certain rewards within our compensation structure. We estimate the change in eligibility requirements resulted in a reduction of approximately 2,000 Paid Affiliates for the three
 months ended September 30, 2024. We are making additional changes in the fourth quarter of 2024.

The year-over-year decrease in segment contribution is primarily attributable to the decline in revenue.

Mainland China . Our Mainland China market continued to be
 challenged during the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, with ongoing macroeconomic factors and the associated decrease in consumer spending leading to declines in revenue, Customers, Paid Affiliates and Sales Leaders. We anticipate the
 current regulatory pressures as well as other economic challenges persisting as the economy works to recover.

The year-over-year decrease in segment contribution for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 primarily reflects lower revenue. In addition, our segment contribution was impacted by a 4.7 percentage point
 and 3.2 percentage point decrease in gross margin for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, attributable to increased sales promotions as well as pressure from the new manufacturing plant that went live in the fourth
 quarter of 2023. Our segment contribution was also impacted by a 2.5 percentage point and 2.4 percentage point increase in selling expenses as a percentage of revenue for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, due to
 increased transitional sales force incentives.

Japan . The third quarter of 2024 decline in revenue is
 primarily attributable to the third quarter of 2023 launch of ageLOC WellSpa iO, which generated 1.6 million in revenue in third quarter
 of 2024, compared to 4.4 million in the third quarter of 2023. In addition, Japan s third quarter and first nine months of 2024 were negatively impacted 2.7 and 8.0 , respectively, from unfavorable foreign-currency fluctuations. Our Paid
 Affiliates were negatively impacted by a change in eligibility requirements for receiving certain rewards within our compensation structure. We estimate the change in eligibility requirements resulted in a reduction of approximately 14,000 Paid
 Affiliates for the three months ended September 30, 2024.

The year-over-year decline in segment contribution reflects the decreased revenue, partially offset by a 1.4 percentage point decline in general and administrative expenses for the nine months period
 ended September 30, 2024 attributable to savings from our restructuring plan.

South Korea . Our South Korea market was challenged by
 difficult macroeconomic trends, including inflationary pressures, and our associated price increases which negatively impacted our revenue, Customers, Paid Affiliates and Sales Leaders for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024. We are
 introducing a new sales performance plan in South Korea starting in November 2024.

The year-over-year decline in segment contribution for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 primarily reflects the decline in revenue.

23 

Table of Contents 

Europe Africa . The reduction in revenue, Customers, Paid Affiliates and Sales Leaders reflects the softening of momentum, as well as the macroeconomic factors that have led to a decline in the purchasing
 power of our customers for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024.

The year-over-year decrease in segment contribution for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 is primarily from declines in revenue, partially offset by a 4.5 and 1.1 percentage point
 improvement in gross margin, primarily from a third quarter price increase and less promotional efforts.

Hong Kong/Taiwan . The declines in our Hong Kong/Taiwan segment for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 are attributable to macroeconomic issues, which are resulting in less purchasing power for our
 consumers. In addition, we experienced some transformational pressures with new technology in Taiwan.

The decline in segment contribution was primarily driven by the decline in revenue, partially offset by savings recognized in general and administrative expenses from our previous restructuring activities.

Manufacturing . Our Manufacturing segment revenue increased 4.1 and 17.2 for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, primarily driven by our Wasatch
 Manufacturing entity. 

The decrease in segment contribution for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 is primarily from the revenue mix amongst our manufacturing entities as well as product mix, which resulted in less
 profitability for the periods presented.

Rhyz Other. The increase in revenue of our Rhyz other segment is primarily driven by 214.4 and 154.9 growth at our Mavely entity, for the third quarter and first nine months
 of 2024. 

The increase in segment contribution for the third quarter of 2024 is primarily from increased profitability at our Mavely entity as it continues to grow. The decline in segment contribution for the
 first nine months of 2024 is primarily from the companies we acquired in the second quarter of 2023, which we are continuing to invest in to enable future growth, as well as the impacts of purchase accounting, which resulted in 2.3 million of
 incremental amortization of intangible assets for the first nine months of 2024.

Consolidated Results

Revenue 

Revenue for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 decreased 14 to 430.1 million, compared to 498.8 million in the prior-year period. Revenue for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 decreased
 13 to 1.3 billion compared to 1.5 billion. Our reported revenue was negatively impacted 3.4 and 3.8 from foreign-currency fluctuations for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, respectively. For a discussion and analysis
 of these decreases in revenue, see Overview and Segment Results, above.

Gross profit 

Gross profit as a percentage of revenue was 70.1 for the third quarter of 2024, compared to 58.6 for the prior-year period, and 70.2 for the first nine months of 2024, compared to 67.9 for the prior-year period. 
 Gross profit as a percentage of revenue for core Nu Skin increased 14.7 percentage points to 76.5 for the third quarter of 2024 and increased 4.7 percentage points to 76.6 for the first nine months of 2024. The third quarter of 2024 and first
 nine months of 2024 increase in our core Nu Skin gross margin is primarily attributable to a third quarter of 2023 65.7 million inventory write-off charge, associated with a re-balancing and narrowing of our portfolio. Our consolidated gross
 margin for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, was also impacted by the gross margin of our owned manufacturing entities, which as previously disclosed, is significantly lower than the gross margin of our core Nu Skin
 business.

Table of Contents 

Selling expenses 

Selling expenses as a percentage of revenue increased to 39.0 for the third quarter of 2024, compared to 37.6 for the prior year period, and decreased to 37.8 for the first nine months of 2024, compared to 37.9 
 for the prior-year period. Core Nu Skin selling expenses as a percentage of revenue increased 1.8 percentage points to 43.5 for the third quarter of 2024 and increased 1.3 percentage points to 42.5 for the first nine months of 2024. Selling
 expenses for our core Nu Skin business are driven by the specific performance of our individual Sales Leaders. Given the size of our sales force and the various components of our compensation and incentive programs, selling expenses as a percentage
 of revenue typically fluctuate plus or minus approximately 100 basis points from period to period. In the third quarter of 2024, we held our global Nu Skin L!VE event with an east L!VE in South Korea and a west L!VE in the United States. As a
 result of these events, we incurred approximately 10.2 million of incremental expenditures, which contributed to our elevated selling expenses.

General and administrative expenses 

General and administrative expenses decreased to 115.6 million in the third quarter of 2024, compared to 130.9 million in the prior-year period and decreased to 358.1 million in the first nine months of 2024,
 compared to 401.8 million in the prior-year period. The 15.3 million decrease for the third quarter of 2024 and 43.7 million decrease for the first nine months of 2024 was primarily from contraction in labor expense and occupancy related
 expenses, both attributable to our ongoing restructuring efforts in which we reduced our physical footprint and reduced our headcount. General and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue increased to 26.9 for the third quarter of 2024,
 from 26.2 for the prior-year period, and increased to 27.8 for the first nine months of 2024, from 27.1 for the prior-year period.

Restructuring and impairment expenses 

In the third quarter of 2022, we adopted a strategic plan to focus resources on our strategic priorities and optimize future growth and profitability. The global program included workforce reductions and footprint
 optimization. Total charges incurred under the program were approximately 53.3 million, with 40.8 million in cash charges of severance and lease termination cost and approximately 12.5 million of non-cash charges of impairment of fixed assets,
 acceleration of depreciation and impairment of other intangibles related to our footprint optimization. During the fourth quarter of 2022, we incurred charges to be settled in cash of 20.1 million in severance charges, 7.4 million in lease
 termination cost, and 5.2 million in other associated cost, and non-cash charges of 8.2 million in fixed asset impairments, 0.9 million in accelerated depreciation and 1.7 million in impairment of other intangibles. During the first quarter of
 2023, we incurred charges to be settled in cash of 4.0 million in severance charges, 1.9 million in lease termination cost, and 2.2 million in other associated cost, and non-cash charges of 1.7 million in accelerated depreciation.

In the fourth quarter of 2023, we adopted another strategic plan to focus resources on our global priorities and optimize future growth and profitability. The global program includes workforce reductions. We estimate
 total charges under the program will approximate 30 35 million in cash charges of severance, approximately 2.2 million in other cash charges and approximately 8.2 million in non-cash charges, including
 approximately 6.4 million in fixed asset impairments. We expect to substantially complete the program during the second half of 2024. The program may expand as we continue to evaluate our business, including our product portfolio, global processes
 and organization, and operational footprint. During the fourth quarter of 2023, we incurred charges to be settled in cash of 10.0 million in severance charges. During the first quarter of 2024, we incurred charges to be settled in cash of 4.1
 million in severance charges and 2.0 million in other associated cost, and non-cash charges of 1.0 million in write-down of assets. During the second quarter of 2024, we incurred charges to be settled in cash of 1.0 million in severance charges
 and 0.1 million on other cash charges, and non-cash charges of 7.2 million in write-down of assets.

During the three months ended June 30, 2024, we determined that the continued decline in our stock price and corresponding market capitalization as well as declines in some of our reporting units forecasts were
 triggering events that required us to perform a quantitative impairment analysis. When we performed an impairment test during the second quarter of 2024, we concluded that the estimated fair value of Americas, Mainland China, Southeast
 Asia/Pacific, Japan, South Korea, Europe Africa, Hong Kong/Taiwan and our BeautyBio reporting units were less than their carrying value of equity as June 30, 2024. As a result, we recorded a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of 130.9
 million in the second quarter of 2024.

In addition, during the three months ended June 30, 2024, we determined that the current operating losses and decline in forecasted losses associated
 with our BeautyBio retail asset group were an interim triggering event that required us to perform an interim impairment analysis on our BeautyBio retail asset group. We assessed the recoverability of the related asset group comparing the
 carrying value of the asset group to the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated. The recoverability test indicated the retail asset group was impaired. We concluded the carrying value of the retail asset group exceeded the estimated
 fair value which resulted in an impairment charge of 10.1 million in our Rhyz other segment during the three months ended June 30, 2024.

Interest expense 

Interest expense decreased to 6.5 million in the third quarter of 2024, compared to 7.5 million in the prior-year period. The third quarter decrease in interest expense is primarily attributable to decreases in
 borrowings on our revolving credit facility. Interest expense for the first nine months of 2024 increased to 20.5 million compared to 18.2 million for the prior-year period. The increase in interest expense were primarily due to increased in
 borrowings on our revolving credit facility in the first half of 2024 compared to 2023, associated with our June 2023 acquisition of BeautyBio.

Other income (expense), net 

Other income (expense), net was 1.6 million for the third quarter of 2024 compared to (0.6) million for the prior-year period and 1.8 million for the first nine months of 2024 compared to 3.2 million for the
 prior-year period. The decrease in other income for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 expense is primarily from the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on the valuation of our intercompany receivables and payables.

Provision (benefit) for income taxes 

Provision (benefit) for income taxes for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 was 5.0 million and (6.8) million, respectively,
 compared to 2.5 million and 15.9 million for the prior-year periods. The effective tax rates for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 were 37.6 and 5.8 of pre-tax income, respectively, compared to (7.3) and 92.4 in the
 prior-year periods. Our tax rate for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 was impacted by our second quarter of 2024 goodwill impairment and restructuring charges. Our 2023 effective tax rates were impacted by our third quarter of 2023
 inventory write-off charge and associated restructuring charges.

Net income (loss) 

As a result of the foregoing factors, net income for the third quarter of 2024 was 8.3 million, compared to (37.0) million in the prior-year period. Net income for the first nine months of 2024 was (110.5)
 million, compared to 1.3 million for the first nine months of 2023.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Historically, our principal uses of cash have included operating expenses (particularly selling expenses) and working capital (principally inventory
 purchases), as well as capital expenditures, stock repurchases, dividends, and debt repayment. We have at times incurred long-term debt, or drawn on our revolving line of credit, to fund strategic transactions, stock repurchases, capital
 investments and short-term operating needs. We typically generate positive cash flow from operations due to favorable margins and have generally relied on cash from operations to fund operating activities. In the first nine months of 2024, we
 generated 86.0 million in cash from operations, compared to 64.5 million during the prior-year period. The increase in cash flow from operations primarily reflects less inventory purchases compared to the first nine months of 2023, as we work to
 right size our balance sheet following the decline in revenue, and an increase in accrued expenses primarily relating to increased deferred revenue associated with timing of sales, partially offset by an increase in cash expenditures associated
 with prepaid assets. Cash and cash equivalents, including current investments, as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were 237.8 million and 267.8 million, respectively, with the decrease being driven by our quarterly debt payments, 50.0
 million paid on our revolving credit facility and capital expenditures, as discussed below, partially offset by 86.0 million in cash from operations.

Working capital . As of September 30, 2024, working capital was
 314.0 million, compared to 373.0 million as of December 31, 2023. Our decline in working capital is primarily attributable to the decline in cash as discussed above, a lower inventory balance and higher current
 portion of long-term debt as we intend to pay off a higher portion of our revolving credit facility in the next twelve months partially offset by an increase in prepaid expenses primarily associated with corporate income tax payments.

Capital expenditures . Capital expenditures for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 29.0 million. We expect that our capital expenditures in 2024 will be primarily related to:

Rhyz plant expansion to increase capacity and capabilities;

purchases and expenditures for computer systems and equipment, software, and application development; and

the expansion and upgrade of facilities in our various markets.

We estimate that capital expenditures for the uses listed above will total approximately 35 55 million for 2024.

Credit Agreement . On June 14, 2022, we entered into an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the Credit Agreement with various financial institutions as lenders and Bank of America, N.A., as administrative
 agent. The Credit Agreement provides for a 400.0 million term loan facility and a 500.0 million revolving credit facility, each with a term of five years. We used the proceeds of the term loan and the draw on the revolving facility to pay off the
 previous credit agreement. Both facilities bear interest at the SOFR, plus a margin based on our consolidated leverage ratio. The term loan facility amortizes in quarterly installments in amounts resulting in an annual amortization of 2.5 during
 the first year and 5.0 during the subsequent years after the closing date of the Credit Agreement, with the remainder payable at final maturity. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had 70.0 million and 120.0 million of outstanding
 borrowings under our revolving credit facility, and 365.0 million and 385.0 million on our term loan facility. The carrying value of the debt also reflects debt issuance costs of 1.5 million and 2.0 million as of September 30, 2024 and December
 31, 2023, respectively, related to the Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement requires us to maintain a consolidated leverage ratio not exceeding 2.75 to 1.00 and a consolidated interest coverage ratio of no less than 3.00 to 1.00. As of September
 30, 2024, we were in compliance with all debt covenants under the Credit Agreement.

Derivative Instruments . As of September 30, 2024, we had four interest rate swaps, with a total notional principal amount of 200 million and a maturity date of July 31, 2025. We entered into these interest
 rate swap arrangements during the third quarter of 2020 to hedge the variable cash flows associated with our variable-rate debt under the Credit Agreement.

Stock repurchase plan . In 2018, our board of directors approved a stock repurchase plan authorizing us to repurchase up to 500.0 million of our outstanding shares of Class A common stock on the open market or
 in private transactions. During the third quarter of 2024, we repurchased no shares of our Class A common stock under the plan. As of September 30, 2024, 162.4 million was available for repurchases under the plan. Our stock repurchases are used
 primarily to offset dilution from our equity incentive plans and for strategic initiatives.

Dividends . In February, May and August 2024, our board of
 directors declared quarterly cash dividends of 0.06 per share. The quarterly cash dividends of 3.0 million were paid on March 6, 2024, June 12, 2024 and September 11, 2024 to stockholders of record on February 26, 2024, May 31, 2024 and August
 30, 2024. In November 2024, our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of 0.06 per share to be paid on December 11, 2024 to stockholders of record on November 29, 2024. Currently, we anticipate that our board of directors will
 continue to declare quarterly cash dividends and that the cash flows from operations will be sufficient to fund our future dividend payments. However, the continued declaration of dividends is subject to the discretion of our board of directors
 and will depend upon various factors, including our net earnings, financial condition, cash requirements, future prospects and other relevant factors.

Cash from foreign subsidiaries . As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we held 237.8 million and 267.8 million, respectively, in cash and cash equivalents, including current investments. These
 amounts include 179.1 million and 213.7 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, held in our operations outside of the U.S. Substantially all of our non-U.S. cash and cash equivalents are readily convertible into U.S.
 dollars or other currencies, subject to procedural or other requirements in certain markets, as well as an indefinite-reinvestment designation, as described below.

We typically fund the cash requirements of our operations in the U.S. through intercompany dividends, intercompany loans and intercompany charges for products, use of intangible property, and corporate services.
 However, some markets impose government-approval or other requirements for the repatriation of dividends. For example, in Mainland China, we are unable to repatriate cash from current operations in the form of dividends until we file the necessary
 statutory financial statements for the relevant period. As of September 30, 2024, we had 32.1 million in cash denominated in Chinese RMB. We also have experienced delays in repatriating cash from Argentina. As of September 30, 2024 and December
 31, 2023, we had 19.5 million and 17.7 million, respectively, in intercompany receivables with our Argentina subsidiary. We also have intercompany loan arrangements in some of our markets, including Mainland China, that allow us to access
 available cash, subject to certain limits in Mainland China and other jurisdictions. We also have drawn on our revolving line of credit to address cash needs until we can repatriate cash from Mainland China or other markets, and we may continue to
 do so. Except for 60.0 million of earnings in Mainland China that we designated as indefinitely reinvested during the second quarter of 2018, we currently plan to repatriate undistributed earnings from our non-U.S. operations as necessary,
 considering the cash needs of our non-U.S. operations and the cash needs of our U.S. operations for dividends, stock repurchases, capital investments, debt repayment and strategic transactions. Repatriation of non-U.S. earnings is subject to
 withholding taxes in certain foreign jurisdictions. Accordingly, we have accrued the necessary withholding taxes related to the non-U.S. earnings.

We currently believe that existing cash balances, future cash flows from operations and existing lines of credit will be adequate to fund our cash needs on both a short- and long-term basis. The majority of our
 historical expenses have been variable in nature, and as such, a potential reduction in the level of revenue would reduce our cash flow needs. In the event that our current cash balances, future cash flow from operations and current lines of credit
 are not sufficient to meet our obligations or strategic needs, we would consider raising additional funds in the debt or equity markets or restructuring our current debt obligations. Additionally, we would consider realigning our strategic plans,
 including a reduction in capital spending, stock repurchases or dividend payments.

Contingent Liabilities

Please refer to Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements contained in this Quarterly Report for information regarding our contingent liabilities.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

The following critical accounting policies and estimates should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included in our Annual Report on
 Form 10-K for the 2023 fiscal year.

Intangible Assets . Acquired intangible assets may represent indefinite-lived assets, determinable-lived intangibles or goodwill. Of these, only the costs of determinable-lived intangibles are
 amortized to expense over their estimated life. The value of indefinite-lived intangible assets and residual goodwill is not amortized, but is tested at least annually for impairment. Our impairment testing for goodwill is performed separately
 from our impairment testing of indefinite-lived intangibles. We test goodwill for impairment, at least annually, by reviewing the book value compared to the fair value at the reportable unit level. We have the option to perform a qualitative
 assessment to determine whether further impairment testing is necessary or to perform a quantitative assessment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying amount, including goodwill. Under the qualitative assessment, an
 entity is not required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless the entity determines that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount. If under the quantitative assessment the fair value of a
 reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then the amount of the impairment loss, if any, must be measured. We elected to perform the quantitative assessment for fiscal year 2022 and we used the qualitative assessment for fiscal years 2023
 and 2021.

Considerable management judgment and assumptions are used in our goodwill impairment assessment, including with respect to the estimated future cash flows, the earnings multiples used in the market
 approach, the discount rate used to discount such estimated future cash flows to their net present value and the reasonableness of the implied control premium relative to our market capitalization. These factors could materially increase or
 decrease the fair value of our reporting units and, accordingly, could result in a related impairment charge. Declines in our market capitalization or in our business performance could also result in a material impairment charge in a future
 period.

During the three months ended March 31, 2024, we determined that the recent decline in our stock price and corresponding market capitalization was a triggering event that required us to perform a quantitative
 impairment analysis. Based on the analysis, we concluded the fair value of all reporting units were in excess of their carrying amounts and no impairment charge was required. For goodwill, the estimated fair value of the reporting units exceeded
 the carrying value by approximately 1 - 7 .

During the three months ended June 30, 2024, we determined that the continued decline in our stock price and corresponding decrease in market capitalization as well as declines in some of our reporting units 
 forecasts were triggering events that required us to perform a quantitative impairment analysis. Based on the analysis, we concluded that the estimated fair value of Americas, Mainland China, Southeast Asia/Pacific, Japan, South Korea, Europe 
 Africa, Hong Kong/Taiwan and our BeautyBio reporting units were less than their carrying value of equity as June 30, 2024. As a result, we recorded a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of 130.9 million in the second quarter of 2024.

During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we determined that the recent decline in our stock price and
 corresponding market capitalization was a triggering event that required the us to perform a quantitative impairment analysis for the Manufacturing and Rhyz other reporting units. Based on the analysis, we concluded the fair value of the
 Manufacturing and Rhyz other reporting units were in excess of their carrying amounts and no impairment charge was required. For goodwill, the estimated fair value of Manufacturing and Rhyz other reporting units exceeded the carrying value by
 approximately 2 - 8 ; therefore, the reporting units are considered to be at risk of future impairment.

Our revenue and profitability forecasts used in the goodwill impairment assessments considered recent and historical performance, strategic initiatives, industry trends and macroeconomic factors. Assumptions used in
 the valuations were similar to those that would be used by market participants performing independent valuations of the business.

Key assumptions developed by management and used in the quantitative analyses:

Financial projections and future cash flows, including a base year that considered recent actual results lower than previous internal forecasts, with revenue growth and profitability improvement throughout the forecast period that
 reflects the long-term strategy for the business, and terminal growth rates based on the expected long-term growth rate of the business; and

Market-based discount rates.

28 

Table of Contents 

Our BeautyBio reporting unit within our Rhyz other segment remains sensitive to future increases in discount rates, and changes in our forecast. We
 performed a sensitivity analysis on the impairment model used to test the manufacturing and Rhyz other reporting units goodwill. In doing so, we determined that individual changes of a 5 reduction in our annual earnings before interest and tax,
 or a 40 basis point increase in the discount rate used in the discounted cash flow models did not cause the estimated fair values of the reporting units to decline below their carrying value. We made our estimates based on information available
 as of the date of our assessment, using assumptions we believe market participants would use in performing an independent valuation of the business. Although we believe the estimates and assumptions used in the impairment testing are reasonable
 and appropriate, it is possible that the assumptions and conclusions regarding impairment or recoverability of our reporting units goodwill could change in future periods. There can be no assurance the estimates and assumptions, particularly our
 long-term financial projections, used in our goodwill impairment testing will prove to be accurate predictions of the future, if, for example, (i) the business does not perform as projected, (ii) overall economic conditions in the remainder of
 Fiscal 2024 or future years vary from current assumptions (including changes in discount rates and foreign currency exchange rates), (iii) business conditions or strategies change from current assumptions, (iv) investors require higher rates of
 return on equity investments in the marketplace, or (v) enterprise values of comparable publicly traded companies, or actual sales transactions of comparable companies, were to decline, resulting in lower multiples of revenues and profitability.
 A future impairment charge to our reporting units goodwill could have a material effect on the consolidated financial position and results of operations.

Seasonality and Cyclicality

In addition to general economic factors, we are impacted by seasonal factors and trends such as major cultural events and vacation patterns. For example, most Asian markets celebrate their respective local New Year
 in the first quarter, which generally has a negative impact on that quarter. We believe that direct selling is also generally negatively impacted during the third quarter, when many individuals, including our sales force, traditionally take
 vacations.

Prior to making a product generally available for purchase in a market, we often do one or more introductory offerings of the product, such as a preview of the product to our Sales Leaders or other product
 introduction or promotion. These offerings sometimes generate significant activity and a high level of purchasing, which can result in a higher-than-normal increase in revenue, Sales Leaders, Paid Affiliates and/or Customers during the quarter and
 can skew year-over-year and sequential comparisons.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

Constant-currency revenue change is a non-GAAP financial measure that removes the impact of fluctuations in foreign-currency exchange rates, thereby facilitating period-to-period comparisons of the Company s
 performance. It is calculated by translating the current period s revenue at the same average exchange rates in effect during the applicable prior-year period and then comparing that amount to the prior-year period s revenue. We believe that
 constant-currency revenue change is useful to investors, lenders and analysts because such information enables them to gauge the impact of foreign-currency fluctuations on our revenue from period to period.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 

Currency Risk and Exchange Rate Information

A majority of our revenue and many of our expenses are recognized outside of the United States, except for inventory purchases, a significant portion of which are primarily transacted in U.S. dollars from vendors in
 the United States. The local currency of each of our Subsidiaries primary markets is considered the functional currency with the exception of our Asia product-distribution subsidiary in Singapore and, as discussed below, our subsidiary in
 Argentina. All revenue and expenses are translated at weighted-average exchange rates for the periods reported. Therefore, our reported revenue and earnings will be positively impacted by a weakening of the U.S. dollar and will be negatively
 impacted by a strengthening of the U.S. dollar. These impacts may be significant because a large portion of our business is derived from outside of the United States. Given the uncertainty of exchange rate fluctuations, it is difficult to predict
 the effect of these fluctuations on our future business, product pricing and results of operations or financial condition.

In the second quarter of 2018, published inflation indices indicated that the three-year cumulative inflation in Argentina exceeded 100 percent, and as of July 1, 2018, we elected to adopt highly inflationary
 accounting for our subsidiary in Argentina. Under highly inflationary accounting, the functional currency for our subsidiary in Argentina became the U.S. dollar, and the income statement and balance sheet for this subsidiary have been measured in
 U.S. dollars using both current and historical rates of exchange. The effect of changes in exchange rates on peso-denominated monetary assets and liabilities has been reflected in earnings in Other income (expense), net and was not material. As of
 September 30, 2024, our subsidiary in Argentina had a small net peso monetary position. Net sales of our subsidiary in Argentina were less than 2 of our consolidated net sales for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and
 2023.

We may seek to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates through the use of foreign currency exchange contracts and through intercompany loans of foreign currency. We do not use
 derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. We regularly monitor our foreign currency risks and periodically take measures to reduce the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations on our operating results. As of September 30,
 2024 and 2023, we did not hold material non-designated mark-to-market forward derivative contracts to hedge foreign denominated intercompany positions or third party foreign debt. As of September 30, 2024, and 2023 we did not hold any material
 forward contracts designated as foreign currency cash flow hedges. We continue to evaluate our foreign currency hedging policy.

For additional information about our market risk see Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements contained in this Quarterly Report.

ITEM 4. 

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

As of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer CEO and Chief Financial Officer CFO ), we
 evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )). Based on that evaluation, our
 CEO and our CFO concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024.

Changes in Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting.

We made no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect,
 our internal control over financial reporting.
