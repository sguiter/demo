 Transfers into Level 3 of assets and liabilities previously classified in Level 2 were due to the relative value of unobservable inputs to the total fair value measurement of certain products and derivative contracts rising above the 10 threshold. Transfers out of Level 3 were primarily due to the relative value of unobservable inputs to the total fair value measurement of certain products and derivative contracts falling below the 10 threshold and thus permitting reclassification to Level 2.

 In certain of the Company s principal markets, the Company relies on price quotes from third parties to value its inventories and physical commodity purchase and sale contracts. These price quotes are generally not further adjusted by the Company in determining the applicable market price. In some cases, availability of third-party quotes is limited to only one or two independent sources. In these situations, absent other corroborating evidence, the Company considers these price quotes as 100 unobservable and, therefore, the fair value of these items is reported in Level 3.

 for the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to for the three months ended March 31, 2023. The increase in the rate was primarily due to the change in the geographic mix of forecasted pretax earnings and the impact of discrete tax items. 
 
 The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development s Pillar Two initiative introduced a 15 global minimum tax applied on a country-by-country basis that has been enacted in certain jurisdictions in which the Company operates, with effective dates starting in fiscal year 2024. The Company is in scope of the enacted legislation and has performed an assessment of the potential exposure based on its most recent tax filings, country-by-country reporting, and the financial results of the constituent entities. Based on the assessment, the effective tax rates in most of the jurisdictions in which the Company operates are above the 15 global minimum tax threshold. However, there are a limited number of jurisdictions where the effective tax rate is close to 15 . ADM does not expect a material liability to global minimum tax in those jurisdictions. 
 
 The Company is subject to income taxation and routine examinations in many jurisdictions around the world and frequently faces challenges regarding the amount of taxes due. These challenges include positions taken by the Company related to the timing, nature, and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. In its routine evaluations of the exposure associated with various tax filing positions, the Company recognizes a liability, when necessary, for estimated potential tax owed by the Company in accordance with applicable accounting standards. Resolution of the related tax positions, through negotiations with relevant tax authorities or through litigation, may take years to complete. Therefore, it is difficult to predict the timing for resolution of tax positions and the Company cannot predict or provide assurance as to the ultimate outcome of these ongoing or future examinations. However, the Company does not anticipate the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits will increase or decrease significantly in the next twelve months. Given the long periods of time involved in resolving tax positions, the Company does not expect the recognition of unrecognized tax benefits will have a material impact on the Company s effective income tax rate in any given period. 
 
 In 2014, the Company s wholly-owned subsidiary in the Netherlands, ADM Europe B.V., received a tax assessment from the Netherlands tax authority challenging the transfer pricing aspects of a 2009 business reorganization, which involved two of its subsidiary companies in the Netherlands. As of March 31, 2024, this assessment was million in tax and million in interest (adjusted for variation in currency exchange rates). On April 23, 2020, the court issued an unfavorable ruling and in October 2020, assigned a third party expert to establish a valuation. During the second quarter of 2021, the third party expert issued a final valuation. On September 30, 2022, the court issued a ruling consistent with the valuation report, and the Dutch tax authorities have filed an appeal. During the quarter ended March 31, 2023, ADM filed a cross-appeal and is currently awaiting the court s ruling. As of March 31, 2024, the Company has accrued its best estimate of what it believes will be the likely outcome of the litigation.

 The Company also has an accounts receivable securitization program (the Second Program with certain commercial paper conduit purchasers and committed purchasers (collectively, the Second Purchasers ). Under the Second Program, certain non-U.S.-originated trade accounts receivable are sold to a wholly-owned bankruptcy-remote entity, ADM Ireland Receivables Company (ADM Ireland Receivables). ADM Ireland Receivables transfers certain of the purchased accounts receivable to each of the Second Purchasers together with a security interest in all of its right, title, and interest in the remaining purchased accounts receivable. In exchange, ADM Ireland Receivables receives a cash payment of up to billion billion) for the accounts receivables transferred. The Second Program terminates on April 18, 2025, unless extended. 
 
 Under the First and Second Programs (collectively, the Programs ), ADM Receivables and ADM Ireland Receivables use the cash proceeds from the transfer of receivables to the First Purchasers and Second Purchasers (collectively, the Purchasers and other consideration, as applicable, to finance the purchase of receivables from the Company and the ADM subsidiaries originating the receivables. The Company accounts for these transfers as sales. The Company acts as a servicer for the transferred receivables. At March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company did not record a servicing asset or liability related to its retained responsibility, based on its assessment of the servicing fee, market values for similar transactions, and its cost of servicing the receivables sold. 
 
 As of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the fair value of trade receivables transferred to the Purchasers under the Programs and derecognized from the Company s consolidated balance sheets was billion and billion, respectively. Total receivables sold were billion and billion for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Cash collections from customers on receivables sold were billion and billion for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. As of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, receivables pledged as collateral to the Purchasers was billion and billion, respectively. 
 
 Transfers of receivables under the Programs resulted in an expense for the loss on sale of million and million for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, which is classified as selling, general, and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of earnings. 
 
 All cash flows under the Programs are classified as operating activities because the cash received from the Purchasers upon both the sale and collection of the receivables is not subject to significant interest rate risk given the short-term nature of the Company s trade receivables.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

This Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD A) should be read in conjunction with the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements. 
 
 Restatement of Previously Issued Consolidated Financial Statements 
 
 As described in the Explanatory Note above and in Part I, Item 1, Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company has restated its Consolidated Financial Statements as of March 31, 2024 and 2023 and for the quarters ended March 31, 2024 and 2023 contained in this Amendment. As a result, the previously reported financial information as of March 31, 2024 and 2023 and for the quarters ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, in this Item 2. MD A has been updated to reflect the relevant restatements. See Item 1, Note 1. Basis of Presentation and Restatement of Previously Filed Consolidated Financial Statements, and Note 13. Segment Information, in the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to the restatements, including descriptions of the adjustments and the impacts on the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company also is correcting certain segment disclosure presentation errors. 
 
 Company Overview 
 
 ADM is an essential global agricultural supply chain manager and processor; a premier human and animal nutrition provider; a trailblazer in groundbreaking solutions to support healthier living; an industry-leading innovator in replacing petroleum-based products; and a leader in sustainability. The Company is one of the world s leading producers of ingredients for sustainable nutrition. The Company uses its significant global asset base to originate and transport agricultural commodities, connecting to markets in over 190 countries. The Company also processes corn, oilseeds, and wheat into products for food, animal feed, industrial, and energy uses. The Company also engages in the manufacturing, sale, and distribution of a wide array of ingredients and solutions including plant-based proteins, natural flavors, flavor systems, natural colors, emulsifiers, soluble fiber, polyols, hydrocolloids, probiotics, prebiotics, enzymes, botanical extracts, and other specialty food and feed ingredients. The Company uses its global asset network, business acumen, and its relationships with suppliers and customers to efficiently connect the harvest to the home thereby generating returns for its shareholders, principally from margins earned on these activities. 
 
 The Company s operations are organized, managed, and classified into three reportable business segments: Ag Services and Oilseeds, Carbohydrate Solutions, and Nutrition. Each of these segments is organized based upon the nature of products and services offered. The Company s remaining operations are not reportable business segments, as defined by the applicable accounting standard, and are classified as Other Business. Financial information with respect to the Company s reportable business segments is set forth in Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 herein, Financial Statements . 
 
 ADM s recent significant portfolio actions and announcements include: 
 
 the acquisitions in January 2024 of Revela Foods, a Wisconsin-based developer and manufacturer of innovative dairy flavor ingredients and solutions and FDL, a UK-based leading developer and producer of premium flavor and functional ingredient systems. 
 
 Sustainability is a key driver in ADM s expanding portfolio of environmentally responsible, plant-derived products. Consumers today increasingly expect their food and drink to come from sustainable ingredients, produced by companies that share their values, and ADM is continually finding new ways to meet those needs through its portfolio actions. 
 
 The Company s strategic transformation is focused on three strategic pillars: Productivity, Innovation, and Culture. 
 
 The Productivity pillar includes (1) partnering across various global teams including procurement, supply chain, operations, and commercial to optimize costs and improve production volumes across the enterprise; (2) continued roll out of the 1ADM business transformation program and implementation of improved standardized business processes; and (3) increased use of technology, data analytics, and automation at production facilities, in offices, and with customers to improve efficiencies and customer service. 
 
 The Innovation pillar includes expansions and investments in (1) improving the customer experience by leveraging producer relationships and enhancing the use of state-of-the-art digital technology; (2) sustainability-driven innovation, which 
 35 

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) 

 encompasses the full range of products, solutions, capabilities, and commitments to serve customers needs; and (3) growth initiatives, including organic growth with additional capacity to meet growing market demand and strategic objectives. 
 
 The Culture pillar focuses on building capabilities and enabling collaboration, teamwork, and agility from process standardization and digitalization and ADM s diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives, which bring new perspectives and expertise to the Company s decision-making. 
 
 ADM plans to support the three pillars with investments in technology, which include expanding digital capabilities and investing further in research and development. 
 
 Environmental and Social Responsibility 
 
 The Company s policy to protect forests, biodiversity, and communities includes provisions that promote conservation of water resources and biodiversity in agricultural landscapes, promote solutions to reduce climate change and greenhouse gas emissions, and support agriculture as a means to advance sustainable development by reducing poverty and increasing food security. Additionally, the policy confirms ADM s commitment to protect human rights defenders, whistleblowers, complainants, and community spokespersons; ADM s aspiration to cooperate with all parties necessary to enable access to fair and just remediation; and the Company s non-compliance protocol for suppliers. In 2022, the Company achieved full traceability of its direct and indirect sourcing throughout its soy supply chains in Brazil, Paraguay, and Argentina. ADM is committed to eliminating deforestation from all of the Company s supply chains by 2025. In 2023, after a strategic investigation of the impact of conversion of native habitats in its key supply chains, the Company announced its commitment to eliminate conversion of native habitats in high risk areas in South America for direct suppliers of all commodities by 2025 and indirect suppliers by 2027, with a 2025 cutoff date (a date after which conversion of primary native vegetation renders a given area or production unit non-compliant) for both direct and indirect suppliers. 
 
 The Company s environmental goals, collectively called Strive 35 an ambitious plan to, by 2035, reduce absolute Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 25 percent from a 2019 baseline, reduce Scope 3 emissions by 25 from a 2021 baseline, reduce energy intensity by 15 percent from a 2019 baseline, reduce water intensity by 10 percent from a 2019 baseline, and achieve a 90 percent landfill diversion rate. In 2023, ADM refined two of its Strive 35 commitments to more meaningfully drive progress: ADM aims to reduce its absolute water withdrawal by 10 , from a 2019 baseline, by 2035, and ADM aims to increase its use of low-carbon energy sources to 25 of total energy used by 2035. 
 
 Operating Performance Indicators 
 
 The Company is exposed to certain risks inherent to an agricultural-based commodity business. These risks are further described in Part I Item 1A, Risk Factors included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 The Company s Ag Services and Oilseeds and Carbohydrate Solutions operations are principally agricultural commodity-based businesses where changes in selling prices move in relationship to changes in prices of the commodity-based agricultural raw materials. As a result, changes in agricultural commodity prices have relatively equal impacts on both revenues and cost of products sold. Therefore, changes in revenues of these businesses do not necessarily correspond to changes in margins or gross profit. Thus, gross margins per volume or metric ton are more meaningful than gross margins as percentage of revenues. 
 
 The Nutrition businesses also utilize agricultural commodities (or products derived from agricultural commodities) as raw materials. However, in these operations, agricultural commodity market price changes do not necessarily correlate to changes in cost of products sold. Therefore, changes in revenues of these businesses may correspond to changes in margins or gross profit. Thus, gross margins rates are more meaningful as a performance indicator in these businesses. 
 
 The Company has consolidated subsidiaries in more than 70 countries. For the majority of the Company s subsidiaries located outside the United States, the local currency is the functional currency except for certain significant subsidiaries in Switzerland where Euro is the functional currency, and Brazil and Argentina where U.S. dollar is the functional currency. Revenues and expenses denominated in foreign currencies are translated into U.S. dollars at the weighted average exchange rates for the applicable periods. For the majority of the Company s business activities in Brazil and Argentina, the functional currency is the U.S. dollar; however, certain transactions, including taxes, occur in local currency and require remeasurement to the functional currency. Changes in revenues are expected to be correlated to changes in expenses reported by the Company caused by 
 36 

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) 

 fluctuations in the exchange rates of foreign currencies, primarily the Euro, British pound, Canadian dollar, and Brazilian real, as compared to the U.S. dollar. Effective April 1, 2022, the Company changed the functional currency of its Turkish entities to the U.S. dollar which did not and is not expected to have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements. 
 
 The Company measures its performance using key financial metrics including net earnings, adjusted earnings per share (EPS), gross margins, segment operating profit, total segment operating profit, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), adjusted EBITDA, return on invested capital, economic value added, and operating cash flows before working capital. Some of these metrics are not defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and should be considered in addition to, and not in lieu of, GAAP financial measures. For more information, see Non-GAAP Financial Measures on page 41 . The Company s financial results can vary significantly due to changes in factors such as fluctuations in energy prices, weather conditions, crop plantings, government programs and policies, trade policies, changes in global demand, general global economic conditions, changes in standards of living, global production of similar and competitive crops, and geopolitical developments. Due to the unpredictable nature of these and other factors, the Company undertakes no responsibility for updating any forward-looking information contained within Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 

Market Factors Influencing Operations or Results in the Three Months Ended March 31, 2024 
 
 The Company is subject to a variety of market factors which affect the Company's operating results. In Ag Services and Oilseeds, following two years of very favorable market conditions, several headwinds in the agriculture cycle led to more normalized results throughout the entire value chain. Ag Services experienced slow South American farmer selling, low demand for North American exports, along with low margins in all regions with the move to a carry market. Crushing saw strong run rates, the anticipation of a more normal global supply environment, and new capacity suppressing meal values. In Refined Products and Other, oil values in North America were under pressure due to low carbon intensity feedstocks competing in the renewable diesel market. In Carbohydrate Solutions, demand for starches and sweeteners remained solid with margins remaining steady across the entire portfolio. Industry ethanol stocks remained elevated. Solid export demand for ethanol helped minimize the imbalance between supply and demand. In Nutrition, demand was softer in a few food and beverage product categories. Human Nutrition was impacted by inflation which drove lower demand and impacted volumes in alternative proteins. Demand has started to recover in the food, beverage, and dietary supplement segment. In Animal Nutrition, a soft amino acids market driven by price weakness in North America was partially compensated by a slightly improved market in Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA). The global feed and feed additives market remained challenged on the demand side, with weakness in the Chinese beef and pork business and continued subdued global shrimp prices. 
 
 Three Months Ended March 31, 2024 Compared to Three Months Ended March 31, 2023 
 
 Earnings before income taxes decreased 512 million from 1.4 billion to 885 million. Total segment operating profit (a non-GAAP measure) decreased 432 million from 1.6 billion to 1.2 billion due primarily to lower results in Refined Products and Other, Ag Services, Crushing, Human Nutrition, and Starches and Sweeteners, partially offset by higher results in Wilmar, Vantage Corn Processors, and Animal Nutrition. Total segment operating profit (a non-GAAP measure) excluded asset impairment and restructuring charges totaling 6 million. Excluded from the total segment operating profit (a non-GAAP measure) in the prior-year quarter was a net charge of 6 million consisting of charges totaling 7 million related to asset impairment and restructuring, partially offset by a gain on the sale of certain assets of 1 million. Corporate results in the current quarter were a net charge of 426 million and included restructuring charges of 12 million. Corporate results in the prior-year quarter were a net charge of 322 million and included a mark-to-market gain of 5 million on the conversion option of the exchangeable bonds issued in August 2020. 
 
 Income tax expense decreased 59 million to 166 million. The effective tax rate for the quarter ended March 31, 2024 was 18.8 compared to 16.1 for the quarter ended March 31, 2023. The increase in the rate was primarily due to changes in the geographic mix of forecasted pretax earnings and the impact of discrete tax items.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) 

 Analysis of Statements of Earnings 
 
 Processed volumes by product for the quarter are as follows (in metric tons): 
 Three Months Ended March 31, (In thousands) 2024 2023 Change Oilseeds 9,387 8,627 760 Corn 4,407 4,394 13 Total 13,794 13,021 773 
 
 The Company generally operates its production facilities, on an overall basis, at or near capacity, adjusting facilities individually, as needed, to react to the current margin environment and seasonal local supply and demand conditions. The overall increase in oilseeds processed volumes was primarily related to improved crush rates in the current quarter compared to lower crush rates in the prior-year quarter resulting from weather related issues and reduced capacity due to the Russian-Ukraine war. 
 
 Revenues by segment for the quarter are as follows: 
 Three Months Ended March 31, 2024 2023 Change (In millions) Ag Services and Oilseeds Ag Services 11,197 11,695 (498) Crushing 3,327 3,683 (356) Refined Products and Other 2,695 3,201 (506) Total Ag Services and Oilseeds 17,219 18,579 (1,360) Carbohydrate Solutions Starches and Sweeteners 2,156 2,737 (581) Vantage Corn Processors 527 800 (273) Total Carbohydrate Solutions 2,683 3,537 (854) Nutrition Human Nutrition 964 936 28 Animal Nutrition 872 917 (45) Total Nutrition 1,836 1,853 (17) Total Segment Revenues 21,738 23,969 (2,231) Other Business 109 103 6 Total Revenues 21,847 24,072 (2,225) 
 
 Revenues and cost of products sold in a commodity merchandising and processing business are significantly correlated to the underlying commodity prices and volumes. During periods of significant changes in commodity prices, the underlying performance of the Company is better evaluated by looking at margins because both revenues and cost of products sold, particularly in Ag Services and Oilseeds, generally have a relatively equal impact from market price changes, which generally result in an insignificant impact to gross profit. 
 38 

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) 

 Revenues decreased 2.2 billion to 21.8 billion due to lower sales prices 5.0 billion), partially offset by higher sales volumes 2.8 billion). Lower sales prices of oils, corn, soybeans, and meal and lower sales volumes of alcohol, rapeseed, and farming materials, were partially offset by higher sales volumes of corn, soybeans, wheat, and meal. Ag Services and Oilseeds revenues decreased 7 to 17.2 billion due to lower sales prices 4.3 billion), partially offset by higher sales volumes 3.0 billion). Carbohydrate Solutions revenues decreased 24 to 2.7 billion due to lower sales prices 0.7 billion) and lower sales volumes 0.2 billion). Nutrition revenues of 1.8 billion was comparable to the prior-year quarter. 
 
 Cost of products sold decreased 1.8 billion to 20.2 billion due principally to lower average commodity costs. Manufacturing expenses decreased 86 million to 1.8 billion due principally to lower energy costs, partially offset by higher salaries and benefit costs and commercial service fees. 
 
 Foreign currency translation increased revenues by 64 million and cost of products sold by 64 million. 
 
 Gross profit decreased 0.4 billion or 20 to 1.7 billion. Lower results in Ag Services and Oilseeds 363 million), Starches and Sweeteners 58 million), and Human Nutrition 48 million) were partially offset by higher results in Vantage Corn Processors 18 million), Animal Nutrition 17 million), and Other 17 million). These factors are explained in the segment operating profit discussion on page 4 0 . 
 
 Selling, general, and administrative expenses increased 70 million to 951 million due primarily to higher legal and professional fees, increased amortization of intangibles, and higher salaries and benefit costs. 
 
 Asset impairment, exit, and restructuring costs increased 11 million to 18 million. Charges in the current quarter consisted of 3 million of impairments related to certain long-lived assets and 3 million of restructuring, presented as specified items, and restructuring of 12 million in Corporate. Charges in the prior-year quarter consisted of 3 million of impairments related to certain long-lived assets and 4 million of restructuring, presented as specified items. 
 
 Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates increased 38 million to 212 million due primarily to higher earnings from the Company s investment in Wilmar. 
 
 Interest and investment income decreased 11 million to 123 million due primarily to a valuation loss related to an investment in alternative protein and precision fermentation, partially offset by higher interest income driven by higher interest rates. 
 
 Interest expense increased 19 million to 166 million due primarily to increased short-term rates on customer deposit balances in ADM Investor Services. Interest expense in the prior-year quarter also included a mark-to-market gain adjustment of 5 million related to the conversion option of the exchangeable bonds issued in August 2020. 
 
 Other income-net decreased 18 million to 26 million. Income in the current quarter included gains on disposals of individually insignificant assets in the ordinary course of business, the non-service components of net pension benefit income, net foreign exchange gains, and net other income. Income in the prior-year quarter included gains on disposals of individually insignificant assets in the ordinary course of business, the non-service components of net pension benefit income, net foreign exchange gains, and net other income.

 Three Months Ended March 31, 2024 2023 Change (In millions) Earnings before income taxes 885 1,397 (512) Other Business (earnings) loss (121) (97) (24) Corporate 426 322 104 Specified Items: Gains on sale of assets (1) 1 Impairment and restructuring charges 6 7 (1) Total Segment Operating Profit 1,196 1,628 (432) Segment Operating Profit Ag Services and Oilseeds Ag Services 232 348 (116) Crushing 313 427 (114) Refined Products and Other 170 327 (157) Wilmar 149 109 40 Total Ag Services and Oilseeds 864 1,211 (347) Carbohydrate Solutions Starches and Sweeteners 261 313 (52) Vantage Corn Processors (13) (34) 21 Total Carbohydrate Solutions 248 279 (31) Nutrition Human Nutrition 76 138 (62) Animal Nutrition 8 8 Total Nutrition 84 138 (54) 
 
 Ag Services and Oilseeds segment operating profit decreased 29 . Ag Services results were lower than the first quarter of 2023 due to the stabilization of trade flows leading to lower global trade and risk management results. Crushing results were lower than the prior-year quarter as increased imports of used cooking oil and the anticipation of large South American supplies negatively impacted North American soy crush margins. Significant positive mark-to-market timing impacts that contributed to the prior-year quarter results also drove lower results in the current quarter. Refined Products and Other results were lower than the prior-year quarter as the increased imports of used cooking oil negatively impacted refining margins in North America. Negative mark-to-market timing impacts affected current quarter results versus positive impacts in the prior-year quarter. Equity earnings from Wilmar were higher versus the first quarter of 2023. 
 
 Carbohydrate Solutions segment operating profit decreased 11 . Starches and Sweeteners results were lower year-over-year as strong starches and sweeteners margins were offset by lower domestic ethanol margins due to strong industry production and elevated stocks, as well as moderating margins in the EMEA region. Vantage Corn Processors results improved year-over-year as strong demand for sustainably certified exports of ethanol supported volumes and margins . 
 
 Nutrition segment operating profit decreased 39 . Human Nutrition results were lower than the first quarter of 2023 as impacts related to unplanned downtime at Decatur East and a normalizing texturants market negatively impacted margins. 
 40 

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) 

 Animal Nutrition results were higher compared to the same quarter last year as cost optimization efforts and lower input costs bolstered margins. 
 
 Other Business operating profit increased 24 million. Captive insurance results were higher due to higher program premiums and lower claims. ADM Investor Services results improved on higher net interest income. 
 
 Corporate results for the quarter are as follows: 
 Three Months Ended March 31, 2024 2023 Change (In millions) Interest expense-net (110) (103) (7) Unallocated corporate costs (304) (248) (56) Gain on debt conversion option 5 (5) Restructuring charges (12) (12) Other income 24 (24) Total Corporate (426) (322) (104) 
 
 Corporate results were a net charge of 426 million in the current quarter compared to a net charge of 322 million in the prior-year quarter. Interest expense-net increased 7 million due primarily to lower capitalized interest. Unallocated corporate costs increased 56 million due primarily to increases in legal and professional fees, global technology spend, incentive compensation accruals, and financing costs. Gain on debt conversion option in the prior-year quarter was related to the mark-to-market adjustment of the conversion option of the exchangeable bonds issued in August 2020. Other income in the current quarter includes foreign exchange gains of 15 million and the non-service components of net pension benefit income of 5 million offset by an investment revaluation loss of 18 million. Other income in the prior-year quarter included the non-service components of net pension benefit income of 4 million and foreign exchange gains of 22 million. 

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 
 The Company uses adjusted net earnings, adjusted earnings per share (EPS), adjusted EBITDA, and total segment operating profit, non-GAAP financial measures as defined by the SEC, to evaluate the Company s financial performance. These performance measures are not defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and should be considered in addition to, and not in lieu of, GAAP financial measures. 
 
 Adjusted net earnings is defined as net earnings adjusted for the effects on net earnings of specified items. Adjusted EPS is defined as diluted EPS adjusted for the effects on reported diluted EPS of specified items. EBITDA is defined as earnings 
 before interest on borrowings, taxes, and depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, adjusted for specified items. The Company calculates adjusted EBITDA by removing the impact of specified items and adding back the amounts of income tax expense, interest expense on borrowings, and depreciation and amortization to net earnings. Total segment operating profit is defined as ADM s consolidated earnings before income taxes, adjusted for Other business, Corporate, and specified items. 
 
 Management believes that adjusted net earnings, adjusted EPS, adjusted EBITDA, and total segment operating profit are useful measures of the Company s performance because they provide investors additional information about the Company s operations allowing better evaluation of underlying business performance and better period-to-period comparability. Adjusted net earnings, adjusted EPS, adjusted EBITDA, and total segment operating profit are not intended to replace or be an alternative to net earnings, diluted EPS, net earnings, and earnings before income taxes, respectively, the most directly comparable amounts reported under GAAP. The table on page 4 0 provides a reconciliation of total segment operating profit to earnings before income taxes for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023. 
 
 In this Amendment, the Company is revising its reconciliation and calculation of total segment operating profit. The revised reconciliation in Note 13. Segment Information presents a subtotal for total segment operating profit that is equal to the sum of the segment operating profit reported for each of the Ag Services and Oilseeds, Carbohydrate Solutions and Nutrition segments. 
 41 

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) 

 Amounts for other business and specified items, which previously were reflected in the calculation of total segment operating profit, are now reflected as reconciling items, similar to Corporate, between total segment operating profit and earnings before income taxes. 
 
 The table below provides a reconciliation of net earnings to adjusted net earnings and diluted EPS to adjusted EPS for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) 

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 A Company objective is to have sufficient liquidity, balance sheet strength, and financial flexibility to fund the operating and capital requirements of a capital-intensive agricultural commodity-based business. The Company depends on access to credit markets, which can be impacted by its credit rating and factors outside of ADM s control, to fund its working capital needs and capital expenditures. The primary source of funds to finance ADM s operations, capital expenditures, and advancement of its growth strategy is cash generated by operations and lines of credit, including a commercial paper borrowing facility and accounts receivable securitization programs. In addition, the Company believes it has access to funds from public and private equity and debt capital markets in both U.S. and international markets. 
 
 Cash provided by operating activities was 0.7 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to a use of 1.6 billion for the same period last year. Working capital changes decreased cash by 0.2 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to a decrease of 2.9 billion for the same period last year. Segregated investments increased 0.2 billion due to increased trading activity in the Company s futures commission and brokerage business. Trade receivables decreased 0.1 billion due to lower revenues. Inventories decreased 0.3 billion due to lower inventory prices and volumes. Trade payables decreased 0.7 billion primarily due to lower payables related to grain purchases. Brokerage payables increased approximately 0.3 billion due to increased trading activity in the Company s futures commission and brokerage business. 
 
 Cash used in investing activities was 1.2 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to 0.3 billion for the same period last year. Capital expenditures for the three months ended March 31, 2024 of 0.3 billion was comparable to the same period last year. Net assets of businesses acquired in the three months ended March 31, 2024 were 0.9 billion compared to none in the same period last year. 
 
 Cash used in financing activities was 2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to cash provided of 0.6 billion for the same period last year. Long-term debt payments were immaterial for the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to 2 million for the same period last year. Net borrowings on short-term credit agreements for the three months ended March 31, 2024 were 1.6 billion compared to 1.3 billion for the same period last year. Share repurchases for the three months ended March 31, 2024 were 1.3 billion compared to 0.4 billion for the same period last year. Dividends were 0.3 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to 0.2 billion for the same period last year. 
 
 At March 31, 2024, the Company had 0.8 billion of cash and cash equivalents and a current ratio, defined as current assets divided by current liabilities, of 1.5 to 1. Included in working capital was 6.7 billion of readily marketable commodity inventories. At March 31, 2024, the Company s capital resources included shareholders equity of 23.2 billion and lines of credit, including the accounts receivable securitization programs described below, totaling 12.8 billion, of which 8.8 billion was unused. The Company s ratio of long-term debt to total capital (the sum of long-term debt of 8.2 billion and shareholders equity of 23.2 billion in 2024 and the sum of long-term debt of 8.3 billion and shareholders equity of 24.1 billion in 2023) was 26 and 25 at March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The Company uses this ratio as a measure of the Company s long-term indebtedness and an indicator of financial flexibility. The Company s ratio of net debt (the sum of short-term debt of 1.7 billion, current maturities of long-term debt of 1 million, and long-term debt of 8.2 billion less the sum of cash and cash equivalents of 0.8 billion and short-term marketable securities of none in 2024 and the sum of short-term debt of 0.1 billion, current maturities of long-term debt of 1 million, and long-term debt of 8.3 billion less the sum of cash and cash equivalents of 1.4 billion and short-term marketable securities of none in 2023) to capital (the sum of net debt of 9.2 billion and shareholders equity of 23.2 billion in 2024 and the sum of net debt of 7.0 billion and shareholders' equity of 24.1 billion in 2023) was 28 and 22 at March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Of the Company s total lines of credit, 5.0 billion supported the combined U.S. and European commercial paper borrowing programs, against which there was 0.9 billion of commercial paper outstanding at March 31, 2024. 
 
 As of March 31, 2024, the Company had 0.8 billion of cash and cash equivalents, 0.7 billion of which was cash held by foreign subsidiaries whose undistributed earnings are considered indefinitely reinvested. Based on the Company s historical ability to generate sufficient cash flows from its U.S. operations and unused and available U.S. credit capacity of 5.2 billion, the Company has asserted that these funds are indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S. 
 
 The Company has accounts receivable securitization programs (the Programs with certain commercial paper conduit purchasers and committed purchasers. The Programs provide the Company with up to 3.0 billion in funding against accounts receivable transferred into the Programs and expands the Company s access to liquidity through efficient use of its balance sheet assets (see Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 herein, Financial Statements for 
 43 

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) 

 more information and disclosures on the Programs). As of March 31, 2024, the Company had 0.7 billion unused capacity of its facility under the Programs. 
 
 As of March 31, 2024, the Company has total available liquidity of 9.6 billion comprised of cash and cash equivalents and unused lines of credit with a well-diversified group of primarily investment-grade institutions. 
 
 For the three months ended March 31, 2024, the Company spent approximately 0.3 billion in capital expenditures, 0.3 billion in dividends, and 1.3 billion in share repurchases. The Company has a stock repurchase program. On March 12, 2024, the Company entered into an ASR Agreement with Merrill Lynch International, an affiliate of BofA Securities, Inc., to repurchase 1.0 billion of ADM common stock as part of ADM s existing share repurchase program to repurchase up to 200 million shares through December 31, 2024. On March 28, 2024, the Company received an interim delivery of 8,880,986 shares at an average share price of 60.596 or 538 million. Under the program, the Company had 38.5 million shares remaining as of March 31, 2024 that may be repurchased until December 31, 2024. On April 15, 2024, the Company received a final delivery of 7,325,733 shares as final settlement of the ASR transaction (see Notes 11 and 18 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 herein, Financial Statements for more information). As of the final settlement date, the Company had 31.2 million shares remaining that may be repurchased under the program until December 31, 2024. 
 
 In 2024, the Company expects total capital expenditures of approximately 1.3 billion and additional cash outlays of approximately 1.0 billion in dividends and up to 2.3 billion in share repurchases, subject to other strategic uses of capital and the evolution of operating cash flows and the working capital position throughout the year. 

Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments 
 
 The Company s purchase obligations as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were 12.2 billion and 14.0 billion, respectively. The decrease is primarily related to lower energy commitments and obligations to purchase agricultural commodity inventories at lower prices. As of March 31, 2024, the Company expects to make payments related to purchase obligations of 11.6 billion within the next twelve months. There were no other material changes in the Company s contractual obligations during the quarter ended March 31, 2024. 

Off Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 
 There were no material changes in the Company s off balance sheet arrangements during the quarter ended March 31, 2024. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 
 There were no material changes in the Company s critical accounting policies and estimates during the quarter ended March 31, 2024. For a description of the Company s critical accounting policies, estimates, and assumptions used in the preparation of the Company s financial statements, see Part II, Item 7 and Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, of the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the year ended December 31, 2023. 

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 
 The market risk inherent in the Company s market risk sensitive instruments and positions is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in: commodity market prices as they relate to the Company s net commodity position, foreign currency exchange rates, and interest rates. Significant changes in market risk sensitive instruments and positions for the quarter ended March 31, 2024 are described below. There were no material changes during the period in the Company s potential loss arising from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. 
 
 For detailed information regarding the Company s market risk sensitive instruments and positions, see Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 44 

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (Continued) 

 Commodities 
 
 The availability and prices of agricultural commodities are subject to wide fluctuations due to factors such as changes in weather conditions, crop disease, plantings, government programs and policies, competition, changes in global demand, changes in customer preferences and standards of living, and global production of similar and competitive crops. 
 
 The fair value of the Company s commodity position is a summation of the fair values calculated for each commodity by valuing all of the commodity positions at quoted market prices for the period, where available, or utilizing a close proxy. The Company has established metrics to monitor the amount of market risk exposure, which consist of volumetric limits and value-at-risk (VaR) limits. VaR measures the potential loss, at a 95 confidence level, that could be incurred over a one-year period. Volumetric limits are monitored daily and VaR calculations and sensitivity analysis are monitored weekly. 
 
 In addition to measuring the hypothetical loss resulting from an adverse two standard deviation move in market prices (assuming no correlations) over a one-year period using VaR, sensitivity analysis is performed measuring the potential loss in fair value resulting from a hypothetical 10 adverse change in market prices. The highest, lowest, and average weekly position together with the market risk from a hypothetical 10 adverse price change is as follows: 
 Three months ended Year ended March 31, 2024 December 31, 2023 Long/(Short) (In millions) 
 Fair Value Market Risk Fair Value Market Risk Highest position (265) (27) 498 50 Lowest position 6 1 (6) (1) Average position (56) (6) 125 13 
 
 The change in fair value of the average position was due to the overall decrease in average quantities, partially offset by the increase in prices of certain commodities. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 At the time of the filing of this Amendment, an evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act )), as of March 31, 2024. Based on that evaluation, the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, concluded the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of March 31, 2024, due to the material weakness described below. 
 
 Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
 As disclosed in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the year ended December 31, 2023, during the fourth quarter of 2023, in connection with the Investigation, the Company identified a material weakness in its internal control over financial reporting related to the Company s accounting practices and procedures for segment disclosures. The material weakness resulted from inadequate controls that allowed for certain intersegment sales to be reported at amounts that were not in accordance with ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers . Specifically, the Company did not have adequate controls in place around measurement of certain intersegment sales between the Company s reporting segments. In addition, appropriate controls were not in place for the reporting of intersegment sales and for the application of disclosure requirements within ASC 280, Segment Reporting . The absence of adequate controls with respect to the reporting of intersegment sales impacted the completeness and accuracy of the Company s segment disclosures and review controls over projected financial information utilized in goodwill and other long-lived asset impairment tests. 
 
 Remediation Plan 
 
 The Company is implementing enhancements to its internal controls to remediate the identified material weakness in its internal control over financial reporting related to the Company s accounting practices and procedures for intersegment sales and to enhance the reliability of its financial statements with respect to the pricing and reporting of such sales. Specifically, the 
 45 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES (Continued) 

Company is: (i) enhancing the Company s accounting policies with respect to the measurement of intersegment sales; (ii) improving and documenting the Company s pricing guidelines for intersegment sales; (iii) enhancing the design and documentation of the execution of pricing and measurement controls, including as to the completeness and accuracy of the reporting for intersegment sales disclosure purposes and projected financial information used in impairment analyses; and (iv) increasing training for relevant personnel on the measurement of and application of relevant accounting guidance to intersegment sales and segment disclosures. 
 
 While the Company believes that these efforts will improve its internal control over financial reporting, the Company will not be able to conclude whether the steps the Company is taking will remediate the material weakness in internal control over financial reporting until a sustained period of time has passed to allow management to test the design and operational effectiveness of the new and enhanced controls. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
 The Company is implementing a new enterprise resource planning (ERP) system on a worldwide basis, which is expected to occur in phases over the next several years. The Company did not have any further deployments of the ERP system during the quarter ended March 31, 2024. 
 
 Except for the material weakness described above and the related remediation measures that are being implemented, there have been no changes in internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended March 31, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting. 
 
 During the quarter ended March 31, 2024, the Company completed the acquisitions of Revela, FDL, and PT. As a result of the acquisitions, the Company is in the process of reviewing the internal control structures of these businesses and, if necessary, will make appropriate changes as the Company incorporates its controls and procedures into the acquired businesses. 
 46 

PART II OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
 
 The Company is routinely involved in a number of actual or threatened legal actions, including those involving alleged personal injuries, employment law, product liability, intellectual property, environmental issues, alleged tax liability (see Note 10, Income Taxes of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 herein, Financial Statements, for information on income tax matters), and class actions. The Company also routinely receives inquiries from regulators and other government authorities relating to various aspects of our business, and at any given time, the Company has matters at various stages of resolution. The outcomes of these matters are not within our complete control and may not be known for prolonged periods of time. In some actions, claimants seek damages, as well as other relief including injunctive relief, that could require significant expenditures or result in lost revenues. In accordance with applicable accounting standards, the Company records a liability in its consolidated financial statements for material loss contingencies when a loss is known or considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If the reasonable estimate of a known or probable loss is a range, and no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other, the minimum amount of the range is accrued. If a material loss contingency is reasonably possible but not known or probable, and can be reasonably estimated, the estimated loss or range of loss is disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. When determining the estimated loss or range of loss, significant judgment is required to estimate the amount and timing of a loss to be recorded. Estimates of probable losses resulting from litigation and governmental proceedings involving the Company are inherently difficult to predict, particularly when the matters are in early procedural stages, with incomplete facts or legal discovery; involve unsubstantiated or indeterminate claims for damages; potentially involve penalties, fines, disgorgement, or punitive damages; or could result in a change in business practice. See Note 17, Legal Proceedings of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 herein, Financial Statements, for information on the Company s legal proceedings which is incorporated herein by reference.
