 (1) The table above excludes the unallocated portfolio layer basis adjustments totaling million related to AFS securities hedged in a closed portfolio at December 31, 2023. See Note 11 Derivative Financial Instruments of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company reviewed each available for sale security that had an unrealized loss at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The Company does not have the intent to sell these securities, and it is more likely than not the Company will not be required to sell the securities before recovery of the securities amortized cost basis. This conclusion is based upon considering the Company s cash and working capital requirements and contractual and regulatory obligations, none of which the Company believes would cause the sale of the securities. If the Company identifies any decline in the fair value due to credit loss factors and an evaluation indicates that a credit loss exists, then the present value of cash flows that is expected to be collected from the security is compared to the amortized cost basis of the security. If the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected is less than the amortized cost basis, a credit loss exists and an allowance for credit losses is recorded for the credit loss, limited by the amount that the fair value is less than the amortized cost basis. All but one of these securities are rated investment grade or better, and all these securities have a long history of no credit losses. The Bank holds approximately million of corporate debt from a New York based bank holding company that on February 6, 2024 was downgraded two levels to Ba2 (Moody s non-investment grade). On March 1, 2024 the bond was downgraded four levels to B3 and then on March 15, 2024 the bond was upgraded one level to B2. At this time, we do not consider the decline in fair value to be credit related given the underlying bond has not missed any payments and financial performance has not deteriorated to a level where the institution is not well capitalized. The Bank has placed the security on the watch list and will continue to monitor this risk position closely to determine if any action steps and valuation adjustments are required in the future. It is not anticipated that this security or any other available for sale security held at September 30, 2024 would be settled at a price that is less than the amortized cost of the Company s investment. In determining the risk of loss for available for sale securities, the Company considered that mortgage-backed securities are either fully guaranteed or issued by a government sponsored enterprise, which has a credit rating and perceived credit risk comparable to the U.S. government, and that issuers of the collateralized loan obligations CLO and the issuer of corporate securities are global systematically important banks. Each of these securities is performing according to its terms

 allowance for credit loss was recorded. The Company reviewed each held-to-maturity security at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 as part of its quarterly Current Expected Credit Loss CECL process, resulting in an allowance for credit losses of million at both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. It is the Company s policy to exclude accrued interest receivable from the calculation of the allowance for credit losses on held-to-maturity and the valuation of available for sale securities. Accrued interest receivable on held-to-maturity securities totaled million at both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 and accrued interest receivable on available for sale debt securities totaled million and million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.

 Loans are reported at their outstanding principal balance net of any unearned income, charge-offs, deferred loan fees and costs on originated loans, certain market value adjustments related to hedging and unamortized premiums or discounts on purchased loans. Loan fees and certain loan origination costs are deferred. Net loan origination costs and premiums or discounts on loans purchased are amortized into interest income over the contractual life of the loans using the level-yield method. Prepayment penalties received on loans which pay in full prior to their scheduled maturity are included in interest income in the period they are collected. Interest on loans is recognized on an accrual basis. Accrued interest receivable totaled million and million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, and was reported in Interest and dividends receivable on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. The accrual of income on loans is generally discontinued when certain factors, such as contractual delinquency of 90 days or more, indicate reasonable doubt as to the timely collectability of such income. Uncollected interest previously recognized on non-accrual loans is reversed from interest income at the time the loan is placed on non-accrual status. A non-accrual loan can be returned to accrual status when contractual delinquency returns to less than 90 days delinquent. Payments received on non-accrual loans that do not bring the loan to less than 90 days delinquent are recorded on a cash basis. Payments can also be applied first as a reduction of principal until all principal is recovered and then subsequently to interest, if in management s opinion, it is evident that recovery of all principal due is likely to occur. Allowance for credit losses The allowance for credit losses ACL is an estimate that is deducted from the amortized cost basis of the financial asset to present the net carrying value at the amount expected to be collected on the financial assets. Loans are charged off against that ACL when management believes that a loan balance is uncollectable based on quarterly analysis of credit risk. The amount of the ACL is based upon a loss rate model that considers multiple factors which reflects management s assessment of the credit quality of the loan portfolio. Management estimates the allowance balance using relevant information, from internal and external sources, relating to past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. The factors are both quantitative and qualitative in nature including, but not limited to, historical losses, economic conditions, trends in delinquencies, value and adequacy of underlying collateral, volume and portfolio mix, and internal loan processes. The Company has made a policy election to exclude accrued interest from the amortized cost basis of loans. The Company recorded a provision for credit losses on loans totaling million and million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The Company recorded a provision for credit losses on loans totaling million and million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The provision recorded during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was driven by increased reserves on two commercial business relationships and one multi-family relationship and by an increase in the qualitative reserve to capture additional risk related to credit concentrations. The ACL - loans totaled million on September 30, 2024 compared to million on December 31, 2023. On September 30, 2024, the ACL - loans represented of gross loans and of non-performing loans. On December 31, 2023, the ACL - loans represented of gross loans and of non-performing loans. The Company may modify loans to enable a borrower experiencing financial difficulties to continue making payments when it is deemed to be in the Company s best long-term interest. When modifying a loan, an assessment of whether a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty is made on the date of modification. This modification may include reducing the loan interest rate, extending the loan term, any other-than-insignificant payment delay, principal forgiveness or any combination of these types of modifications. When such modifications are performed, a change to the allowance for credit losses is generally not required as the methodologies used to estimate the allowance already capture the effect of borrowers experiencing financial difficulty. On September 30, 2024, there were no commitments to lend additional funds to borrowers who have received a loan modification due to financial difficulty.

If a loan does not fall within one of the previously mentioned categories and management believes weakness is evident then we designate the loan as Watch; all other loans would be considered Pass. Loans that are non-accrual are designated as Substandard, Doubtful or Loss. These loan designations are updated quarterly. We designate a loan as Substandard when a well-defined weakness is identified that may jeopardize the orderly liquidation of the debt. We designate a loan as Doubtful when it displays the inherent weakness of a Substandard loan with the added provision that collection of the debt in full, on the basis of existing facts, is highly improbable. We designate a loan as Loss if it is deemed the debtor is incapable of repayment. The Company does not hold any loans designated as Loss, as loans that are designated as Loss are charged to the Allowance for Credit Losses.

The Company reports as interest income or interest expense in the Consolidated Statement of Income, the interest receivable or payable on the financial instruments selected for the fair value option at their respective contractual rates. The borrowed funds had a contractual principal amount of million at both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The fair value of borrowed funds includes accrued interest payable of million at both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The Company generally holds its earning assets to maturity and settles its liabilities at maturity. However, fair value estimates are made at a specific point in time and are based on relevant market information. These estimates do not reflect any premium or discount that could result from offering for sale at one time the Company s entire holdings of a particular instrument. Accordingly, as assumptions change, such as interest rates and prepayments, fair value estimates change, and these amounts may not necessarily be realized in an immediate sale. Disclosure of fair value does not require fair value information for items that do not meet the definition of a financial instrument or certain other financial instruments specifically excluded from its requirements. These items include core deposit intangibles and other customer relationships, premises and equipment, leases, income taxes and equity. Further, fair value disclosure does not attempt to value future income or business. These items may be material and accordingly, the fair value information presented does not purport to represent, nor should it be construed to represent, the underlying market or franchise value of the Company.

 of the appraised or internally estimated value of the property. See Note 5 Loans of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Other Real Estate Owned and Other Repossessed Assets: At the time of foreclosure these properties are acquired at fair value, less estimated selling costs. The fair value is based on appraised value through a current appraisal, or sometimes through an internal review. This determination is made on an individual asset basis. If the fair value of a property is less than the carrying amount of the loan, the difference is recognized as a charge to the ACL. Further decreases to the estimated value will be recorded directly to the Consolidated Statements of Income through the establishment of a valuation allowance. The fair value for other repossessed assets are based upon the most recently reported arm s length sales transaction. When there is no recent sale activity, the fair value is calculated using capitalization rates. Junior Subordinated Debentures: The fair value of the junior subordinated debentures was developed using a credit spread based on stated spreads for recently issued subordinated debt instruments for issuers of similar asset size and credit quality of the Company and with similar durations adjusting for differences in the junior subordinated debt s credit rating, liquidity, and time to maturity. The unrealized net gain/loss attributable to changes in our own credit risk was determined by adjusting the fair value as determined in the proceeding sentence by the average rate of default on debt instruments with a similar debt rating as our junior subordinated debentures, with the difference from the original calculation and this calculation resulting in the instrument-specific unrealized gain/loss. Interest Rate Swaps: The fair value of interest rate swaps is based upon broker quotes.

At both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company maintained portfolio layer hedges on a closed portfolio of AFS securities with a notional amount of million and a closed portfolio of loans with a notional amount of million. For non-portfolio layer method fair value hedges, the hedge basis (the amount of the change in fair value) is added to (or subtracted from) the carrying amount of the hedged item. For portfolio layer method hedges, the hedge basis does not adjust the carrying value of the hedged item and is instead maintained on a closed portfolio basis. These basis adjustments would be allocated to the amortized cost of specific loans or AFS securities within the pools if either of the hedges were de-designated. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we held derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, fair value hedges and certain derivatives not designated as hedges. The Company s derivative instruments are carried at fair value in the Company s financial statements as part of Other Assets for derivatives with positive fair values and Other Liabilities for derivatives with negative fair values. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative instrument is dependent upon whether or not it qualifies and has been designated as a hedge for accounting purposes, and further, by the type of hedging relationship. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, derivatives with a combined notional amount of million and million, respectively, were not designated as hedges. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, derivatives with a combined notional amount of million and million, respectively, were designated as fair value hedges. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, derivatives with a combined notional amount of million and million, respectively, were designated as cash flow hedges. For cash flow hedges, the changes in the fair value of the derivatives are reported in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax. Amounts in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) are reclassified into earnings in the same period during which the hedged forecasted transaction affected earnings. During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, million and million in reduced expense, respectively, was reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to interest expense. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, million and million in reduced expense was reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss to interest expense. The estimated amount to be reclassified in the next 12 months out of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) into earnings is million in reduced expense. A portion of the reduced expense is driven by the amortization of income from terminated cash flow hedges. This income is amortized over the remaining original terms of terminated cash flow hedges. During the three months ended September 30, 2024 there were cashflow hedges terminated. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company terminated cash flow hedges with a combined notional value of million, resulting in a net gain of million. There were cashflow hedges terminated during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, income from the amortization of terminated cash flow hedges totaled

The Bank was organized in 1929 as a New York State-chartered mutual savings bank. Today the Bank operates as a full-service New York State-chartered commercial bank. The Bank s primary regulator is the New York State Department of Financial Services, and its primary federal regulator is the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation FDIC ). Deposits are insured to the maximum allowable amount by the FDIC. Additionally, the Bank is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank system. The primary business of Flushing Financial Corporation has been the operation of the Bank. At September 30, 2024, the Bank owns two subsidiaries: Flushing Service Corporation and FSB Properties Inc. The Bank also operates an internet branch, which operates under the brands of iGObanking.com and BankPurely (the Internet Branch ). The activities of Flushing Financial Corporation are primarily funded by dividends, if any, received from the Bank, issuances of subordinated debt, junior subordinated debt, and issuances of equity securities. Flushing Financial Corporation s common stock is traded on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol FFIC. Our principal business is attracting retail deposits from the general public and investing those deposits together with funds generated from ongoing operations and borrowings, primarily in (1) originations and purchases of multi-family residential loans, commercial business loans, commercial real estate mortgage loans and, to a lesser extent, one-to-four family loans (focusing on mixed-use properties, which are properties that contain both residential dwelling units and commercial units); (2) Small Business Administration SBA loans and other small business loans; (3) construction loans; (4) mortgage loan surrogates such as mortgage-backed securities; and (5) U.S. government securities, corporate fixed-income securities and other marketable securities. We also originate certain other consumer loans including overdraft lines of credit. Our results of operations depend primarily on net interest income, which is the difference between the income earned on our interest-earning assets and the cost of our interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest income is the result of our net interest rate margin, which is the difference between the average yield earned on interest-earning assets and the average cost of interest-bearing liabilities, adjusted for the difference in the average balance of interest-earning assets as compared to the

 average balance of interest-bearing liabilities. We also generate non-interest income primarily from loan fees, service charges on deposit accounts, and other fees, income earned on Bank Owned Life Insurance BOLI ), dividends on Federal Home Loan Bank of New York FHLB-NY stock and net gains and losses on sales of securities and loans. Our operating expenses consist principally of employee compensation and benefits, occupancy and equipment costs, other general and administrative expenses and income tax expense. Our results of operations can also be significantly affected by changes in the fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities for which changes in value are recorded through earnings and our periodic provision for credit losses. Our investment policy, which is approved by the Board of Directors, is designed primarily to manage the interest rate sensitivity of our overall assets and liabilities, to generate a favorable return without incurring undue interest rate risk and credit risk, to complement our lending activities and to provide and maintain liquidity. In establishing our investment strategies, we consider our business and growth strategies, the economic environment, our interest rate risk exposure, our interest rate sensitivity gap position, the types of securities to be held and other factors. We classify our investment securities as available for sale or held-to-maturity. We carry a portion of our financial assets and financial liabilities under the fair value option and record changes in their fair value through earnings in non-interest income on our Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income. A description of the financial assets and financial liabilities that are carried at fair value through earnings can be found in Note 10 Fair Value of Financial Instruments of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 we reported net income of 8.9 million, or 0.30 per diluted common share, an increase of 3.6 million, or 67.3 from net income of 5.3 million, or 0.18 per diluted common share earned in the three months ended June 30, 2024. The increase in net income was primarily driven by increases in net interest income and non-interest income of 2.8 million and 2.1 million, respectively, and a decrease in non-interest expense of 0.4 million, partially offset by an increase of 0.9 million in the provision for credit losses. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the net interest margin increased five basis points to 2.10 from 2.05 in the three months ended June 30, 2024 . Excluding prepayment penalty income from loans, net recoveries/reversals of interest from non-accrual and delinquent loans, net gains (losses) from fair value adjustments on hedges, and purchase accounting adjustments, the net interest margin decreased three basis points to 1.99 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 2.02 for the three months ended June 30, 2024 . Approximately 90 of our loan portfolio is collateralized by real estate with an average loan to value of less than 36 . We have a long history and foundation built upon disciplined underwriting, strong credit quality, and a resilient seasoned loan portfolio with solid asset protection. At September 30, 2024 our allowance for credit losses ACL to gross loans stood at 59 basis points and our ACL to non-performing loans was 117.7 . Non-performing assets at the end of the quarter were 59 basis points of total assets. Goodwill is presumed to have an indefinite life and is tested for impairment, rather than amortized, on at least an annual basis. Quoted market prices in active markets are the best evidence of fair value and are to be used as the basis for measurement, when available. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, there is no impairment of goodwill. At September 30, 2024, the market capitalization of our reporting unit did not exceed its carrying value, however the fair value of our reporting unit is not driven solely by the market price of our stock. For goodwill impairment testing, management has concluded that the Company has one reporting unit. The Company performed a quantitative assessment in testing for the impairment of goodwill as of December 31, 2023, concluding that there was no goodwill impairment. At September 30, 2024 we tested goodwill through a qualitative assessment concluding no impairment was indicated. We monitor goodwill for potential impairment triggers on a quarterly basis. Given the inherent uncertainties resulting from global macroeconomic conditions, actual results may differ from management s current estimates and could have an adverse impact on one or more of the assumptions used in our quantitative model prepared for the reporting unit, which could result in impairment charges in subsequent periods.

Income before Income Taxes. Income before income taxes for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 11.5 million, an increase of 0.7 million, or 6.6 , from 10.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 for the reasons discussed above.

The decrease was primarily due to a decline in the effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 to 22.3 compared to 27.1 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The three months ended September 30, 2024 included a discrete tax benefit totaling 0.5 million which is not expected to repeat in future periods.

The current average loan-to-value ratio for our non-performing assets collateralized by real estate was 55.0 at September 30, 2024. The Bank continues to maintain conservative underwriting standards.

Income before Income Taxes. Income before income taxes for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 23.6 million, a decrease of 4.5 million, or 16.0 , from 28.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 for the reasons discussed above.

The nine months ended September 30, 2024 included a discrete tax benefit totaling 0.5 million which is not expected to repeat in future periods. FINANCIAL CONDITION Assets.

The decreased loan originations were a result of the absence of loans that met both our underwriting and pricing criteria. We continue to focus on the origination of multi-family residential, commercial real estate and commercial business loans with a full banking relationship.

We utilize brokered deposits as an additional funding source, to assist in the management of our interest rate risk and as an underlying funding source for a portion of our interest rate swaps. We obtain brokered certificates of deposit as a wholesale funding source when the interest rate on these deposits are below other wholesale options, or to extend the maturities of our deposits. Brokered deposits generally have a higher beta than our retail deposits as the interest rates are typically more sensitive to changes in the federal funds rates. A portion of our brokered certificates of deposit are hedged against rising interest rates using interest rate swaps. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, 800.8 million and 680.0 million, respectively, were hedged using interest rate swaps. See Note 11 Derivative Financial Instruments of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Brokered deposits obtained by the Bank are generally fully FDIC insured. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Bank did not hold any uninsured brokered deposits. The following table shows the composition of brokered deposits at the periods indicated below:

Total stockholders equity was 666.9 million at September 30, 2024, a decrease of 2.9 million, or 0.4 , from 669.8 million at December 31, 2023. Stockholders equity decreased primarily due to the declaration and payment of dividends on the Company s common stock of 0.66 per common share totaling 19.6 million, partially offset by net income totaling 17.9 million. Book value per common share was 22.94 at September 30, 2024 compared to 23.21 at December 31, 2023. Liquidity. Liquidity is the ability to economically meet current and future financial obligations. The Company s primary objectives in terms of managing liquidity are to maintain the ability to originate and purchase loans and securities, repay borrowings as they mature, satisfy financial obligations that arise in the normal course of business and meet our customer s deposit withdrawal needs. Our primary sources of funds are deposits, borrowings, principal and interest payments on loans, mortgage-backed and other securities, and proceeds from sales of securities and loans. Deposit flows and mortgage prepayments, however, are greatly influenced by general interest rates, economic conditions, and competition. The Company has other sources of liquidity, including unsecured overnight lines of credit, brokered deposits and other types of borrowings. During 2024 the FHLB-NY reduced the available lines to all its member banks from 45 of total assets to 30 of total assets. To offset the FHLB-NY policy change, the Company expanded its line with the Federal Reserve. At September 30, 2024, the Company had 3.9 billion in combined available liquidity through cash lines with the FHLB-NY, Federal Reserve and other commercial banks as well as unencumbered securities compared to 4.1 billion at December 31, 2023.

During 2024, funds were provided by the Company s operating and financing activities, which were used to fund our investing activities. The largest use of funds during 2024 was the purchase of 934.9 million of available for sale securities as part of a leveraging strategy which was primarily funded by an increase of 719.9 million in interest-bearing deposits and 206.7 million in net repayments of loans. This strategy, which was completed during the three months ended September 30, 2024, was initiated to offset tempered loan growth. Our most liquid assets are cash and cash equivalents, which include cash and due from banks, overnight interest-earning deposits and federal funds sold with original maturities of 90 days or less. The level of these assets is dependent on our operating, financing, lending, and investing activities during any given period. At September 30, 2024, cash and cash equivalents totaled 267.6 million, an increase of 95.5 million, or 55.5 from 172.2 million, at December 31, 2023. A portion of our cash and cash equivalents is restricted cash held as collateral for interest rate swaps. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, restricted cash totaled 22.8 million and 47.9 million, respectively. INTEREST RATE RISK Interest rate risk is the impact on earnings and capital from changes in interest rates. Interest rate risk exists because our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities may mature or reprice at different times or by different amounts. We assess interest rate risk by comparing the results of several income and capital simulations scenarios to the base case compared to scenarios with changes in interest rates, degree of change over time, speed of change, and changes in the shape of the yield curve. These scenarios have assumptions including loan originations, investment securities purchases and sales, prepayment rates on loans and investment securities, deposit flows, and mix and pricing decisions. Asset/Liability Management. Asset/liability management involves assessing, monitoring and managing interest rate risk. The asset liability committee ALCO Investment Committee of the Board of Directors Board ALCO has primary oversight responsibility of interest rate risk. The actions and activities of the Board ALCO are dictated by the ALCO and Investment Committee Charter of the Company Board of Directors (the Charter ). The Board ALCO has established policy limits for changes of net interest income and the economic value of equity under various scenarios and liquidity risk limits to ensure the Company has sufficient liquid assets to meet its short-term obligations, even during periods of

 financial stress and is reviewed no less frequently than quarterly. The ALCO policy and oversight is interconnected to the Company s capital plan. The Board ALCO reviews simulations of various interest rate scenarios to assess the potential impact on the Company s balance sheet and income statement. The model employed by the Company uses a statistic balance sheet as of the date the modeling is being generated. The limitation to this model is that unexpected events may not be captured in the output. The model is validated no less frequently than annually with the variables in the model subjected to annual stress tests. In addition, the interest rate risk model is back-tested no less frequently than quarterly to ensure the model remains consistent with actual results. The information from the interest rate risk modeling allows the Board ALCO to assess the potential impact of interest rate changes on the Company s profitability and future earnings. The interest rate risk scenarios affect the position the Company may take with the pricing of assets and liabilities. Models are inherently imperfect and subject to assumptions and limitations. The model output is affected by the data quality and the assumptions used. The Company uses both internal and external inputs into the model. The market interest rates are obtained from the Federal Reserve WIRP curve and may be adjusted by the management level ALCO committee Management ALCO the change in deposit betas is based upon deposit studies completed by an independent third party; loan prepayment assumptions are based upon internal analysis; loan origination data is Company generated; and additions to assets and liabilities is derived from the budget or forecast or internally generated projected cash flows. There was no material change in the source of the data used in our interest rate risk modeling in the current year. Current economic factors such as interest rate forecasts as changed from period over period may affect the modeling. Key assumptions include deposit betas and loan origination yields. Deposit betas vary by product and direction of interest rates. In an upward shock, weighted average deposit betas (based on period end balances) were 71 at September 30, 2024 compared to 74 in September 30, 2023. In a downward shock, weighted average deposit betas (based on period end balances) were 63 at September 30, 2024 compared to 66 at September 30, 2023. Loan origination yields vary by product and the weighted average yield (based on period end loan balances) was 7.08 at September 30, 2024 compared to 7.16 at September 30, 2023. Management ALCO, which consists of representatives from treasury, finance, business units, and senior management, oversees the interest rate risk, liquidity risk and capital risk while providing regular reports to the Board ALCO. These reports quantify the potential changes in net interest income and economic value of equity through various rate scenarios. The Management ALCO also provides the results of the liquidity stress test prepared by the Chief Risk Officer, the sensitivity analyses of the interest rate risk model variables, and the capital position of the Company and the Bank. Economic Value of Equity Analysis . The Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America GAAP ), which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the changes in fair value of certain investments due to changes in interest rates. Generally, the fair value of financial investments such as loans and securities fluctuate inversely with changes in interest rates. As a result, increases in interest rates could result in decreases in the fair value of the Company s interest-earning assets which could adversely affect the Company s results of operations if such assets were sold, or, in the case of securities classified as available for sale, decreases in the Company s stockholders equity, if such securities were retained. The Company quantifies the net portfolio value should interest rates immediately go up or down 100 or 200 basis points, assuming the yield curves of the rate shocks will be parallel to each other. Net portfolio value is defined as the market value of assets net of the market value of liabilities. The market value of assets and liabilities is determined using a discounted cash flow calculation. The net portfolio value ratio is the ratio of the net portfolio value to the market value of assets. The changes in value are measured as percentage changes from the net portfolio value at the base interest rate scenario. The base interest rate scenario assumes interest rates at September 30, 2024. Various estimates regarding prepayment assumptions are made at each level of rate shock. At September 30, 2024, the Company was within the guidelines set forth by the Board of Directors for each interest rate level.

 The following table presents the change in the Company s net portfolio value and the net portfolio ratio for the following periods: 

Projected Percentage Change In Net Portfolio Value (NPV) Net Portfolio Value Ratio September 30, December 31, September 30, December 31, Change in Interest Rate 2024 2023 2024 2023 -200 Basis points (3.3) (1.8) 5.4 7.4 -100 Basis points (2.6) (0.9) 5.5 7.6 Base interest rate - - 5.8 7.8 +100 Basis points (4.9) (3.5) 5.6 7.7 +200 Basis points (9.0) (6.7) 5.4 7.6 Income Simulation Analysis. The Company manages the mix of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities on a continuous basis to maximize return and adjust its exposure to interest rate risk. The starting point for the net interest income simulation is an estimate of the next twelve months net interest income assuming that both interest rates and the Company s interest-sensitive assets and liabilities remain at period-end levels. The report quantifies the potential changes in net interest income should interest rates go up or down 100 or 200 basis points (shocked), assuming the yield curves of the rate shocks will be parallel to each other. All changes in income are measured as percentage changes from the projected net interest income at the base interest rate scenario. The base interest rate scenario assumes interest rates at September 30, 2024 and 2023. Prepayment penalty income is excluded from this analysis. Actual results could differ significantly from these estimates. At September 30, 2024, the Company was within the guidelines set forth by the Board of Directors for each interest rate level.

 The following table presents the Company s interest rate shock as of September 30, 2024 and 2023: 

Projected Percentage Change In Net Interest Income Change in Interest Rate 2024 2023 -200 Basis points (1.8) (1.0) -100 Basis points (0.4) - Base interest rate - - +100 Basis points (3.5) (3.0) +200 Basis points (7.7) (6.0) Another net interest income simulation assumes that changes in interest rates change gradually in equal increments over the twelve-month period. Prepayment penalty income is excluded from this analysis. Based on these assumptions, net interest income would be reduced by 3.6 from a 200 basis point increase in rates over the next twelve months and a 0.6 reduction from a 200 basis point decrease in rate over the same period. Actual results could differ significantly from these estimates. At September 30, 2024, the Company had a derivative portfolio with a notional value totaling 2.7 billion. This portfolio is designed to provide protection against rising interest rates. See Note 11 Derivative Financial Instruments of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

 AVERAGE BALANCES Net interest income represents the difference between income on interest-earning assets and expense on interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest income depends upon the relative amount of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and the interest rates earned or paid on them. The following tables set forth certain information relating to the Company s Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition and Consolidated Statements of Income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, and reflects the average yield on assets and average cost of liabilities for the periods indicated. Such yields and costs are derived by dividing income or expense by the average balance of assets or liabilities, respectively, for the periods shown. Average balances are derived from average daily balances. The yields include amortization of fees which are considered adjustments to yields.
