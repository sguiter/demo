Credit Agreement 

The Company is party to an Amended and Restated
Loan and Security Agreement (as amended and modified from time to time, the Credit Agreement with its existing lender and
certain of its subsidiaries. The Credit Agreement provides for, among other things, a million term loan to be repaid in quarterly installments
of principal and interest over a term of five years, a revolving line of credit up to a maximum of million (the Revolving Credit
Facility and an incremental facility not to exceed million. The termination date of the term loan is , unless

All outstanding amounts under the Credit Agreement

is also required to pay a quarterly unused revolving line of credit fee of and, in conjunction with the issuance of any letters
of credit, a letter of credit fee of . 

The Credit Agreement includes customary representations,
warranties, and covenants, including financial covenants requiring the Company to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio of no less than
1.25 to 1.00, and a minimum working capital financial covenant, as defined, of no less than 11.25 million, in each of the fiscal quarters
ending through the expiration date. The Credit Agreement provides for events of default, including failure to repay principal and interest
when due and failure to perform or violation of the provisions or covenants of the agreement, as a result of which amounts due under the
Credit Agreement may be accelerated. The loans and all other amounts due and owed under the Credit Agreement and related documents are
secured by substantially all of the Company s assets. 

Lifeway was in compliance with the fixed charge
coverage ratio and minimum working capital covenants at September 30, 2024. 

Revolving Credit Facility 

As of September 30, 2024, the Company had outstanding
under the Revolving Credit Facility. The Company had available for future borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility as of

months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 

and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Income taxes were recognized at effective rates
of and for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 

The Company calculates the provision for income
taxes during interim reporting periods by applying an estimate of the annual effective tax rate for the full year, excluding unusual or
infrequently occurring discrete items, and applies that rate to income (loss) before provision for income taxes for the period. 

The Company s effective tax rate may change
from period to period based on recurring and non-recurring factors including the relative mix of pre-tax earnings (or losses), the jurisdictional
mix of earnings, enacted tax legislation, state income taxes, the impact of non-deductible items, changes in valuation allowances, settlement
of tax audits, and the expiration of the statute of limitations in relation to unrecognized tax benefits. The Company records discrete
income tax items such as enacted tax rate changes and completed tax audits in the period in which they occur. The Company consistently
reflects non-deductible officer compensation expense, non-deductible compensation expense related to equity incentive awards and separate
state tax rates from period to period. Although similar items were reflected in 2024, the percentage effect is different due to the difference
in pre-tax income in 2024 compared to 2023. 

Unrecognized tax benefits were at September
30, 2024 and 2023. The Company does not expect material changes to its unrecognized tax benefits during the next twelve months.

employees. Under the 2015 Omnibus Incentive Plan, the Board of Directors or its Compensation Committee approves stock awards to executive
officers and certain senior executives, generally in the form of restricted stock or performance shares. The number of performance shares

Business Overview 

Lifeway was founded in 1986 by Michael Smolyansky,
ten years after he and his family emigrated from Eastern Europe to the United States. Lifeway was the first to successfully introduce
kefir to the U.S. consumer on a commercial scale, initially catering to ethnic consumers in the Chicago, Illinois metropolitan area. Lifeway
has grown to become the largest producer and marketer of kefir in the U.S. and an important player in the broader market spaces of probiotic-based
products and natural, better for you foods. 

Our primary product is drinkable kefir, a cultured
dairy product. Lifeway Kefir is tart and tangy, high in protein, calcium and vitamin D. The Company manufactures (directly or through
a co-manufacturer) and markets products under the Lifeway, Fresh Made, and GlenOaks Farms brand names, as well as under private labels
on behalf of certain customers. 

The Company s product categories are: 

Drinkable Kefir, a cultured dairy product sold in a variety of organic and non-organic sizes, flavors, and types. 

European-style soft cheeses, including farmer cheese, white cheese, and Sweet Kiss. 

Cream and other, which primarily consists of cream, a byproduct of raw milk processing. 

Drinkable Yogurt, sold in a variety of sizes and flavors. 

ProBugs, a line of kefir products designed for children. 

Other Dairy, which primarily consists of Fresh Made butter and sour cream. 

Products 

In October 2024, we began to roll out our first
products with 100 lactose free labeling. Our products were already up to 99 lactose free, so we are pleased to further attract consumers
with our new Organic Whole Milk Flavor Fusion items that have this added benefit, along with decreased sugar content. New on-trend flavors
like Hot Honey, Matcha Latte, and Passionfruit Lychee just to name a few are amazing additions to our portfolio. The entire
lineup is loaded with high-quality bioavailable nutrients, and plays to our strengths, as our organic products have been incredibly successful
to date. 

We expect health and wellness trends to continue
to be a tailwind for our entire premium product portfolio. We plan to continue to invest behind our key products to capture more and more
of this growing market, 

Distribution Strategy 

In September 2024, we announced our first expansion
of Kefir distribution in the South African market. In November 2024, we announced our expansion within Dubai and the UAE. The offering
of 32oz Lifeway Kefir, 8oz Lactose-Free Lifeway Kefir, ProBugs and farmer cheese, exported from the United States, is expected to begin
shipping in the fourth quarter of 2024 and will become available in supermarkets and hypermarkets in Dubai and across the Emirates. We
are taking a measured, and thoughtful approach to global expansion, as we seek markets that are primed for success and can be accessed
without a major initial investment. 

Unsolicited Offer 

On November 5, 2024, we announced that our board
of directors (our Board determined after careful and thorough consideration, in consultation with its independent financial
and legal advisors, that the unsolicited proposal made on September 23, 2024 by Danone North America PBC Danone to acquire
all of the shares of the Company that it does not already own for 25.00 per share substantially undervalues the Company and is not in
the best interests of the Company and its stockholders or other stakeholders. In connection with that determination, we entered into a
Shareholder Rights Agreement with Computershare Trust Company, N.A., as rights agent (the Rights Agreement ). Pursuant to
the Rights Agreement, our Board declared a dividend of one preferred share purchase right (each a Right for each outstanding
share of Company common stock to stockholders of record as of the close of business on November 18, 2024. Each Right entitles its holder,
subject to the terms of the Rights Agreement, to purchase from the Company one one-thousandth of one share of Series A Junior Participating
Preferred Stock, no par value, of the Company at an exercise price of 130.00 per Right, subject to adjustment. Rights will attach to
any shares of Company common stock that become outstanding after November 18, 2024 and prior to the earlier of the Distribution Time (as
defined in the Rights Agreement) and the redemption or expiration of the Rights, and in certain other circumstances described in the Rights
Agreement. 

21 

Trends and Uncertainties 

Current Macroeconomic Environment 

We have not experienced significant supply chain
disruptions or labor supply shortages and have continued to satisfy customer and consumer demand for our products. Management continues
to proactively manage the supply and transportation of materials used to produce and package our products, staffing, and transportation
of our products to customers. This proactive planning has allowed the Company to meet increased demand.

Net Sales 

Net sales were 46,095 for the three-month period
ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 5,199 or 12.7 versus prior year. The net sales increase was primarily driven by higher volumes
of our branded drinkable kefir. 

Gross Profit 

Gross profit as a percentage of net sales was
25.7 and 27.2 in the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease versus the prior year was primarily
due to unfavorable milk pricing, partially offset by favorable transportation costs. 

22 

Selling Expense 

Selling expenses increased by 1,095 to 3,979
during the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 from 2,884 during the same period in 2023. Selling expenses as a percentage of
net sales increased to 8.6 in the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 from 7.1 during the same period in 2023. The increase
is primarily driven by our continued investments in marketing activities. 

General and Administrative Expense 

General and administrative expenses increased
 479 to 3,564 during the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 from 3,085 during the same period in 2023. General and administrative
expenses as a percentage of net sales increased to 7.7 in the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 from 7.5 during the same period
in 2023. 

Provision for Income Taxes 

The provision for income taxes was 1,350 and
 1,517 during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 

The effective income tax rate for the three months
ended September 30, 2024 was 31.2 compared to 30.8 in the same period last year. The statutory Federal and state tax rates remained
consistent from 2024 to 2023. The Company has items that are nondeductible or are discrete adjustments to tax expense. The Company consistently
reflects non-deductible officer compensation expense, non-deductible compensation expense related to equity incentive awards and separate
state tax rates from period to period. Although similar items were reflected in 2023, the percentage effect is different due to the difference
in pre-tax income in 2024 compared to 2023. 

The Company s effective tax rate may change
from period to period based on recurring and non-recurring factors including the relative mix of pre-tax earnings (or losses), the jurisdictional
mix of earnings, enacted tax legislation, state income taxes, the impact of non-deductible items, changes in valuation allowances, settlement
of tax audits, and the expiration of the statute of limitations in relation to unrecognized tax benefits. The Company records discrete
income tax items such as enacted tax rate changes and completed tax audits in the period in which they occur. 

Income taxes are discussed in Note 10 in the Notes
to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Net Sales 

Net sales were at 139,886 for the nine-month
period ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 21,856 or 18.5 versus prior year. The net sales increase was primarily driven by higher
volumes of our branded drinkable kefir. 

Gross Profit 

Gross profit as a percentage of net sales was
26.2 and 25.9 during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase versus the prior year was primarily
due to the higher volumes of our branded products, which provided manufacturing efficiencies and favorable fixed cost absorption. 

Selling Expense 

Selling expense increased by 2,282 to 11,256
during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 from 8,974 during the same period in 2023. Selling expenses as a percentage of net
sales increased to 8.0 in the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 from 7.6 during the same period in 2023. 

General and Administrative Expense 

General and administrative expense increased 1,849
to 11,877 during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 from 10,028 during the same period in 2023. The increase is primarily
driven by stock-based incentive compensation and non-routine stockholder action expense. 

Provision for Income Taxes 

The provision for income taxes was 4,008 and
 3,554 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 

The effective income tax rate for the nine months
ended September 30, 2024 was 30.4 compared to 32.5 in the same period last year. The statutory Federal and state tax rates remained
consistent from 2024 to 2023. The Company has items that are nondeductible or are discrete adjustments to tax expense. The Company consistently
reflects non-deductible officer compensation expense, non-deductible compensation expense related to equity incentive awards and separate
state tax rates from period to period. Although similar items were reflected in 2023, the percentage effect is different due to the difference
in pre-tax income in 2024 compared to 2023. 

The Company s effective tax rate may change
from period to period based on recurring and non-recurring factors including the relative mix of pre-tax earnings (or losses), the jurisdictional
mix of earnings, enacted tax legislation, state income taxes, the impact of non-deductible items, changes in valuation allowances, settlement
of tax audits, and the expiration of the statute of limitations in relation to unrecognized tax benefits. The Company records discrete
income tax items such as enacted tax rate changes and completed tax audits in the period in which they occur. 

Income taxes are discussed in Note 10 in the Notes
to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Management assesses the Company's liquidity
in terms of its ability to generate cash to fund its operating, investing, and financing activities. The Company remains in a strong financial
position, and while it has been impacted by the macroeconomic challenges with commodity inflation and other input cost increases, the
Company believes that its cash flow from operations, revolving credit, and cash and cash equivalents will continue to provide sufficient
liquidity for its working capital needs, capital resource requirements, and growth initiatives and to ensure the continuation of the Company
as a going concern. 

25 

If additional borrowings are needed,
 5,000 was available under the Revolving Credit Facility as of September 30, 2024 (see Note 7, Debt). We are in compliance with the terms
of the Credit Agreement and expect to meet foreseeable financial requirements. The success of our business and financing strategies will
continue to provide us with the financial flexibility to take advantage of various opportunities as they arise. To date, we have been
successful in generating cash and obtaining financing as needed. However, if a serious economic or credit market crisis ensues, it could
have a negative effect on our liquidity, results of operations and financial condition. 

The Company s most significant
ongoing short-term cash requirements relate primarily to funding operations (including expenditures for raw materials, labor, manufacturing
and distribution, trade and promotions, advertising and marketing, and income tax liabilities) as well as expenditures for property, plant
and equipment. 

Long-term cash requirements primarily
relate to funding deferred income taxes (see Note 10, Income Taxes, in our Annual Report on Form 10-K). 

Cash Flow 

The following table is derived from our Consolidated
Statement of Cash Flows:

Operating Activities 

Net cash provided by operating activities was
 15,541 during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 compared to 12,144 in the same period in 2023. The increase is primarily
due to higher cash earnings driven by increased product volumes. 

Investing Activities 

Net cash used in investing activities was 5,431
during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 compared to 3,206 in the same period in 2023. The increase in cash used reflects
our planned capital spending increase during 2024 compared to 2023. Our capital spending is focused in three core areas: growth, cost
reduction, and facility improvements. Growth capital spending supports capacity expansion and new product innovation and enhancements.
Cost reduction and facility improvements support manufacturing efficiency, safety, and productivity. We continue to make capital expenditures
primarily to modernize manufacturing facilities and support productivity initiatives. 

Financing Activities 

Net cash used in financing activities was 2,750
and 750 during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The cash used represents the quarterly principal

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS. 

The risk factors disclosed under Part I, Item
1A of the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 should be considered together with the information
included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, and should not be limited to those referenced
herein or therein. The following risks and uncertainties supplement the risk factors found under Part I, Item 1A of the Company s
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 

Our business could be adversely affected
as a result of uncertainty regarding proposals or other actions taken by stockholders related to the consideration of a possible future
transaction. 

On September 23, 2024, Danone North America PBC
made an unsolicited proposal to acquire all of the shares of Company common stock that Danone does not already own for 25.00 per share
(the Proposal ). On November 4, 2024, we announced that our Board determined that the proposal substantially undervalues
the Company and is not in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders or other stakeholders. Addressing the Proposal, similar
future proposals and any other actions by stockholders or others relating to a potential change of control transaction involving the Company
could interfere with our ability to execute our strategic plans, make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified executives and
employees, cause management distraction, require us to utilize more resources than anticipated towards review of strategic alternatives
and result in the loss of potential business opportunities, any of which could have a material negative impact on the Company. In addition,
our business and operations may be harmed to the extent that our customers, suppliers and others believe that we cannot effectively compete
in the marketplace without completing a transaction, or there is customer, supplier or employee uncertainty surrounding the future direction
of our product offerings and our strategy on a continued basis. There can be no assurance that any transaction will be completed now or
in the future. 

We have had to, and may continue to be forced
to, incur fees and other expenses related to the Proposal, including for third-party advisors. Further, the Proposal, similar future proposals
and any actual or perceived actions by our stockholders or others relating to a potential transaction involving the Company may cause
significant fluctuations in our stock price based upon temporary or speculative market perceptions or other factors that do not necessarily
reflect the Company s underlying fundamentals and prospects. 

Our shareholder rights plan includes terms
and conditions that could discourage a takeover or other transaction that stockholders may consider favorable. 

On November 4, 2024, in response to the Proposal
and Danone s substantial ownership position in the Company, our Board approved and adopted the Rights Agreement and declared a dividend
of one Right for each outstanding share of Company common stock to stockholders of record at the close of business on November 18, 2024.
Each Right entitles its holder, subject to the terms of the Rights Agreement, to purchase from the Company one one-thousandth of a share
of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, no par value, of the Company at an exercise price of 130.00 per Right, subject to adjustment.
Rights will generally become exercisable only if any person or entity (or any persons or entities acting as a group) acquires 20 or more
of the outstanding shares of Company common stock (or, to the extent any person, entity or group beneficially owned 20 or more of the
outstanding shares of Company common stock as of immediately prior to the first public announcement of the adoption of the Rights Agreement,
such person, entity or group acquires any additional shares). If Rights become exercisable, all holders of Rights (other than the person,
entity or group triggering the Rights Agreement, whose Rights will become void and will not be exercisable) will have the right to purchase
from the Company for 130.00, subject to certain potential adjustments, shares of Company common stock having a market value of twice
that amount. The Rights Agreement expires on November 4, 2025, unless earlier terminated or the Rights are redeemed or exchanged by the
Board. Additional information regarding the Rights Agreement is contained in the Company s Current Report on Form 8-K filed with
the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC on November 5, 2024. 

28 

The Rights Agreement will cause substantial dilution
to any person, entity or group that acquires beneficial ownership of 20 or more of the outstanding shares of Company common stock (or,
to the extent any person, entity or group beneficially owned 20 or more of the outstanding shares of Company common stock as of immediately
prior to the first public announcement of the adoption of the Rights Agreement, such person, entity or group acquires any additional shares).
As a result, the overall effect of the Rights Agreement and the issuance of the Rights may be to discourage any person, entity or group
from gaining a control or control-like position in the Company or engaging in other tactics, potentially disadvantaging the interests
of the Company s stockholders, without negotiating with the Board and without paying an appropriate control premium to all stockholders.
The Rights Agreement has similar provisions to those of other plans adopted by publicly-held companies in comparable circumstances. It
is intended to protect stockholders interests, including by providing the Board sufficient time to make informed judgments and
take actions that are in the best interests of all of the Company s stockholders and other stakeholders. Nevertheless, the Rights
Agreement may be considered to have certain anti-takeover effects, including potentially discouraging a third party from attempting to
obtain a substantial position in the Company common stock or seeking to obtain control of the Company and discouraging a takeover attempt
that stockholders may consider favorable or that could result in a premium over the market price of Company common stock. Even in the
absence of a takeover attempt, the Rights Agreement may adversely affect the prevailing market price of Company common stock if it is
viewed as discouraging takeover attempts in the future. 

The actions of certain of our stockholders
could cause us to incur significant expense, disrupt our business, result in a proxy contest or litigation and adversely impact our stock
price. 

We value constructive input from investors and
regularly engage in dialogue with our stockholders regarding strategy and performance. Our Board and management team are committed to
acting in the best interests of all of our stockholders. 

Two of the Company s stockholders, Edward
Smolyansky (our former Chief Operations Officer and the son of our founder) and Ludmila Smolyansky (a former member of our Board and the
widow of our founder (together with Mr. Smolyansky (the Family Stockholders )), filed a Schedule 13D/A with the SEC on August
14, 2024 announcing their intention, among other things, to nominate seven director candidates for election to our Board and replace seven
of the eight members of our Board. The Family Stockholders subsequently filed a preliminary consent solicitation statement with the SEC
in furtherance of this objective, and they have made public statements critical of our Board, management and strategy and repeatedly called
for the sale of the Company. A contested election with respect to the Company s directors could require us to incur substantial
legal, public relations and other advisory fees and proxy solicitation expenses. Further, we may choose to initiate, or may become subject
to, litigation as a result of proposals by the Family Stockholders or other stockholders or proxy contests or matters relating thereto,
which would serve as a further distraction to our Board and management and could require us to incur significant additional costs. 

We may be subject to continued or similar activism
in the future, which could cause us to incur significant expense, hinder execution of our business strategy and adversely impact the market
price of Company common stock. Stockholder actions, including potential proxy contests, require significant time and attention by management
and our Board, potentially interfering with our ability to execute our strategic plan. Such stockholder action could give rise to perceived
uncertainties as to our future, adversely affect our relationships with our employees, customers or suppliers and make it more difficult
to attract and retain qualified personnel and business partners. These perceived uncertainties may also be exploited by our competitors
and/or other stockholders, which could result in lost business opportunities and make it more difficult to execute on our long-term strategic
plan. If customers choose to delay, defer or reduce transactions with us or do business with our competitors instead of us, then our business,
financial condition and operating results would be adversely affected. We may be required to incur significant legal fees and other expenses
related to stockholder actions, and the attention of our management may be diverted by such actions. Any of these impacts could materially
and adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition, and the market price of Company common stock could be subject
to significant fluctuation or otherwise be adversely affected. If individuals are elected or appointed to our Board with a specific agenda
or who do not agree with our strategic plan, the ability of our Board to function effectively could be adversely affected, which could
in turn adversely affect our ability to effectively and timely implement our strategic plan and create additional value for our stockholders,
and/or adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.

Pursuant
to Section 6.10 of the 

 Illinois
Business Corporation Act 

The
undersigned hereby certifies that, in accordance with Section 6.10 of the Illinois Business Corporation Act, as amended (the IBCA ),
the board of directors (the Board of Lifeway Foods, Inc., an Illinois corporation (the Corporation ),
hereby makes this certificate of designations and hereby states and certifies that pursuant to the authority conferred upon the
Board by the Corporation s Articles of Incorporation, as amended (as such may be further amended, restated or amended and
restated from time to time, the Articles of Incorporation ), and the duly adopted resolutions of the
Board, and pursuant to Section 8.40 of the IBCA, the Board duly adopted the following resolutions on November 4, 2024: 

RESOLVED,
that pursuant to the authority vested in the Board by the Charter (which authorizes 2,500,000 shares of preferred stock, no par
value Preferred Stock )), the Board hereby creates, authorizes and provides for the issue of a series
of Preferred Stock, no par value, of the Corporation, to be designated Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock 
(hereinafter referred to as the Series A Preferred Stock ), initially consisting of 40,000 shares,
and to the extent that the designations, powers, preferences and relative and other special rights and the qualifications, limitations
or restrictions of the Series A Preferred Stock are not stated and expressed in the Charter, hereby fixes and herein states and
expresses such designations, powers, preferences and relative and other special rights and the qualifications, limitations and
restrictions thereof, as follows: 

Section
1. Designation and Amount. The shares of such series shall be designated as Series
A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, and the number of shares constituting such series shall be 40,000. Such number
of shares may be increased or decreased by resolution of the Board; provided , however , that no decrease shall reduce
the number of shares of Series A Preferred Stock to a number less than the number of shares then outstanding plus the number of
shares reserved for issuance upon the exercise of outstanding options, rights or warrants or upon the conversion of any outstanding
securities issued by the Corporation convertible into Series A Preferred Stock. 

Section
 2. Dividends and Distributions. 

(a) Subject to the prior and superior rights of the
holders of any shares of any series of preferred stock ranking prior and superior to the shares of Series A Preferred Stock with
respect to dividends, the holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock, in preference to the holders of common stock, no par
value, of the Corporation (the Common Stock shall be entitled to receive, when, as and if declared
by the Board out of funds legally available for the purpose, quarterly dividends payable in cash on the last business day of March,
June, September and December in each year (each such date being referred to herein as a Quarterly Dividend Payment
Date ), commencing on the first Quarterly Dividend Payment Date after the first issuance of a share or fraction
of a share of Series A Preferred Stock, in an amount per share (rounded to the nearest cent) equal to the greater of (i) 1,000
or (ii) subject to the provision for adjustment hereinafter set forth, 1,000 times the aggregate per share amount of all cash
dividends, plus 1,000 times the aggregate per share amount (payable in kind) of all non-cash dividends or other distributions
other than a dividend payable in shares of Common Stock or a subdivision of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (by reclassification
or otherwise), declared on the Common Stock since the immediately preceding Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, or, with respect
to the first Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, since the first issuance of any share or fraction of a share of Series A Preferred
Stock. In the event the Corporation, at any time after November 4, 2024 (the Rights Declaration Date ),
(x) declares any dividend on Common Stock payable in shares of Common Stock, (y) subdivides the outstanding Common Stock or (z)
combines the outstanding Common Stock into a smaller number of shares, then in each case the amount to which holders of shares
of Series A Preferred Stock were entitled immediately prior to such event under clause (ii) of the preceding sentence shall be
adjusted by multiplying such amount by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately
after such event and the denominator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior
to such event. 

(b) The Corporation shall declare a dividend or distribution
on the Series A Preferred Stock as provided in Section 2(a) above immediately after it declares a dividend or distribution
on the Common Stock (other than a dividend payable in shares of Common Stock); provided , however , that, in the event
no dividend or distribution shall have been declared on the Common Stock during the period between any Quarterly Dividend Payment
Date and the next subsequent Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, subject to the prior and superior rights of the holders of any shares
of any series of Preferred Stock ranking prior to and superior to the shares of Series A Preferred Stock with respect to dividends,
a dividend of 1.00 per share on the Series A Preferred Stock shall nevertheless be payable on such subsequent Quarterly Dividend
Payment Date. 

(c) Dividends shall begin to accrue and be cumulative
on outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock from the Quarterly Dividend Payment Date next preceding the date of issue of
such shares of Series A Preferred Stock, unless the date of issue of such shares is prior to the record date for the first Quarterly
Dividend Payment Date, in which case dividends on such shares shall begin to accrue from the date of issue of such shares, or
unless the date of issue is a Quarterly Dividend Payment Date or is a date after the record date for the determination of holders
of shares of Series A Preferred Stock entitled to receive a quarterly dividend and before such Quarterly Dividend Payment Date,
in either of which events such dividends shall begin to accrue and be cumulative from such Quarterly Dividend Payment Date. Accrued
but unpaid dividends shall not bear interest. Dividends paid on the shares of Series
A Preferred Stock in an amount less than the total amount of such dividends at the time accrued and payable on such shares shall
be allocated pro rata on a share-by-share basis among all such shares at the time outstanding. The Board may fix a record date
for the determination of holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock entitled to receive payment of a dividend or distribution
declared thereon, which record date shall be no more than sixty (60) days prior to the date fixed for the payment thereof. 

2 

Section
3. Voting Rights. The holders of shares of Series A Preferred
Stock shall have the following voting rights: 

(a) Subject to the provision for adjustment hereinafter
set forth, each share of Series A Preferred Stock shall entitle the holder thereof to 1,000 votes on all matters submitted to
a vote of the shareholders of the Corporation. In the event the Corporation at any time after the Rights Declaration Date (i)
declares any dividend on Common Stock payable in shares of Common Stock, (ii) subdivides the outstanding Common Stock or (iii)
combines the outstanding Common Stock into a smaller number of shares, then in each such case the number of votes per share to
which holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock were entitled immediately prior to such event shall be adjusted by multiplying
such number by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event
and the denominator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to such event. 

(b) Except as otherwise provided herein or by law,
the holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock and the holders of shares of Common Stock shall vote collectively as one class
on all matters submitted to a vote of shareholders of the Corporation. 

(c) Except as set forth herein or as otherwise provided
by law, holders of Series A Preferred Stock shall have no special voting rights and their consent shall not be required (except
to the extent they are entitled to vote with holders of Common Stock as set forth herein) for taking any corporate action. 

Section
 4. Certain Restrictions. 

(a) Whenever quarterly dividends or other dividends
or distributions payable on the Series A Preferred Stock as provided in Section 2 above are in arrears, thereafter and
until all accrued and unpaid dividends and distributions, whether or not declared, on shares of Series A Preferred Stock outstanding
shall have been paid in full, the Corporation shall not: 

(i) declare or pay dividends on, make any other distributions on, or redeem or purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration any
shares of capital stock ranking junior (either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up) to the Series A
Preferred Stock other than (A) such redemptions or purchases that may be deemed to occur upon the exercise of stock options, warrants
or similar rights or grant, vesting or lapse of restrictions on the grant of any performance shares, restricted stock, restricted
stock units or other equity awards to the extent that such shares represent all or a portion of (x) the exercise or purchase price
of such options, warrants or similar rights or other equity awards or (y) the amount of withholding taxes owed by the holder of
such award in respect of such grant, exercise, vesting or lapse of restrictions; (B) such purchases necessary to satisfy the
 issuance of any shares upon the exercise or to satisfy the vesting and settlement of any options, warrants or similar rights
or other equity awards pursuant to the terms of the Corporation s equity plans maintained for the benefit its employees,
directors and other service providers; or (C) the repurchase, redemption or other acquisition or retirement for value of any such
shares from employees, directors, former directors, consultants or former consultants of the Corporation or their respective estate,
spouse, former spouse or family member, pursuant to the terms of the agreement pursuant to which such shares were acquired; 

3 

(ii) declare or pay dividends on or make any other distributions on any shares of stock ranking on a parity (either as to dividends
or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up) with the Series A Preferred Stock, except dividends paid ratably on the Series
A Preferred Stock and all such parity stock on which dividends are payable or in arrears in proportion to the total amounts to
which the holders of all such shares are then entitled; 

(iii) redeem or purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration shares of any capital stock ranking on a parity (either as to dividends
or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up) with the Series A Preferred Stock; provided , that the Corporation may at
any time redeem, purchase or otherwise acquire shares of any such parity stock in exchange for shares of any capital stock of
the Corporation ranking junior (either as to dividends or upon dissolution, liquidation or winding up) to the Series A Preferred
Stock; or 

(iv) purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration any shares of Series A Preferred Stock, or any shares of capital stock ranking
on a parity with the Series A Preferred Stock, except in accordance with a purchase offer made in writing or by publication (as
determined by the Board) to all holders of such shares upon such terms as the Board, after consideration of the respective annual
dividend rates and other relative rights and preferences of the respective series and classes, shall determine in good faith will
result in fair and equitable treatment among the respective series or classes. 

(b) The Corporation shall not permit any subsidiary
of the Corporation to purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration any shares of stock of the Corporation unless the Corporation
could, under Section 4(a) above, purchase or otherwise acquire such shares at such time and in such manner. 

Section
5. Reacquired Shares. Any shares of Series A Preferred Stock
purchased or otherwise acquired by the Corporation in any manner whatsoever shall be retired and cancelled promptly after the
acquisition thereof. All such shares shall upon their cancellation become authorized but unissued shares of Preferred Stock and
may be reissued as part of a new series of Preferred Stock to be created by resolution or resolutions of the Board, subject to
the conditions and restrictions on issuance set forth herein. 

4 

Section
6. Liquidation, Dissolution or Winding Up. 

(a) Upon any liquidation (voluntary or otherwise),
dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, no distribution shall be made to the holders of shares of capital stock ranking
junior (either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up) to the Series A Preferred Stock unless, prior thereto,
the holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall have received 1,000 per share, plus
an amount equal to accrued and unpaid dividends and distributions thereon, whether or not declared, to the date of such payment
(the Series A Liquidation Preference ). Following the payment of the full amount of the Series A Liquidation
Preference, no additional distributions shall be made to the holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock unless, prior thereto,
the holders of shares of Common Stock have received an amount per share (the Common Adjustment equal
to the quotient obtained by dividing (i) the Series A Liquidation Preference by (ii) 1,000 (as appropriately adjusted as set forth
in Section 6(c) below to reflect such events as stock splits, reverse stock splits, stock dividends and recapitalizations
with respect to the Common Stock) (such number in clause (ii), the Adjustment Number ). Following the
payment of the full amount of the Series A Liquidation Preference and the Common Adjustment in respect of all outstanding shares
of Series A Preferred Stock and Common Stock, respectively, and the payment of liquidation preferences of all other shares of
capital stock which rank prior to or on a parity with Series A Preferred Stock, holders of Series A Preferred Stock and holders
of shares of Common Stock shall receive their ratable and proportionate share of the remaining assets to be distributed in the
ratio of the Adjustment Number to 1 with respect to such Preferred Stock and Common Stock, on a per share basis, respectively. 

(b) In the event, however, that there are not sufficient
assets available to permit payment in full of the Series A Liquidation Preference and the liquidation preferences of all other
series of Preferred Stock, if any, which rank on a parity with the Series A Preferred Stock, then such remaining assets shall
be distributed ratably to the holders of such parity shares in proportion to their respective liquidation preferences. In the
event, however, that there are not sufficient assets available to permit payment in full of the Common Adjustment, then such remaining
assets shall be distributed ratably to the holders of Common Stock. 

(c) In the event the Corporation at any time after
the Rights Declaration Date (i) declares any dividend on Common Stock payable in shares of Common Stock, (ii) subdivides the outstanding
Common Stock or (iii) combines the outstanding Common Stock into a smaller number of shares, then in each such case the Adjustment
Number in effect immediately prior to such event shall be adjusted by multiplying such Adjustment Number by a fraction the numerator
of which is the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of which is the
number of shares of Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to such event. 

Section
7. Consolidation, Merger, Etc. In case the Corporation enters into any consolidation,
merger, combination or other transaction in which the shares of Common Stock are exchanged for or changed into other stock or
securities, cash and/or any other property, then in any such case each share of Series A Preferred Stock shall at the same time
be similarly exchanged or changed into an amount per share (subject to the provision for adjustment hereinafter set forth) equal
to 1,000 times the aggregate amount of stock, securities, cash and/or any other property (payable in kind), as the case may be,
for which or into which each share of Common Stock is exchanged or changed. In the event the Corporation at any time after the
Rights Declaration Date (a) declares any dividend on Common Stock payable in shares of Common
Stock, (b) subdivides the outstanding Common Stock or (c) combines the outstanding Common Stock into a smaller number
of shares, then in each such case the amount set forth in the preceding sentence with respect to
the exchange or change of shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall be adjusted by multiplying
such amount by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event
and the denominator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to such event. 

5 

Section
8. No Redemption. The shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall
not be redeemable. 

Section
9. Ranking. The Series A Preferred Stock shall rank junior to all other series
of the Corporation s Preferred Stock as to the payment of dividends and the distribution of assets, whether or not upon
the dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the Corporation, unless the terms of any such series provides otherwise. 

Section
10. Amendment. The Charter shall not be amended in any manner which would materially
alter or change the powers, preferences or special rights of the Series A Preferred Stock so as to affect them adversely without
the affirmative vote of the holders of two-thirds of the outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock, voting separately as
a class. 

Section
11. Fractional Shares. Series A Preferred Stock may be issued in fractions of a share
that entitle the holder, in proportion to such holder s fractional shares, to exercise voting rights, receive dividends,
participate in distributions and have the benefit of all other rights of holders of Series A Preferred Stock.

Lifeway Foods 
 Announces Strong Results for the Third Quarter and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 

Year-to-date net sales of 139.9 million; up 18.5 
year-over-year 

Heightened interest in probiotic foods with bioavailable
nutrients drives volume growth of Lifeway Kefir and Farmer Cheese 

20th consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth 

Year-to-date gross profit margin increased to 26.2 

Morton Grove, IL November 14, 2024 Lifeway Foods, Inc.
(Nasdaq: LWAY) Lifeway or the Company ), the leading U.S. supplier of kefir and fermented probiotic products
to support the microbiome, today reported financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024. 

I m thrilled to announce our 20 th 
consecutive quarter of net sales growth, marking an impressive 5 consecutive years worth of quarterly growth for Lifeway on
the topline, commented Julie Smolyansky, President and Chief Executive Officer of Lifeway Foods. We continued this
record year by delivering our second largest quarter ever with 46.1 million in net sales, up double-digits year-over-year, driven
by the continued volume growth of our flagship drinkable Lifeway Kefir. We also saw growth in our cheese category, as our strategic
sales investments have capitalized on the increasing consumer interest in soft cheese products, such as our Lifeway Farmer Cheese.
Our effective sales and marketing investments continue to create demand, drive trial and accelerate velocities in our core
offerings, as evidenced by our remarkable, volume-led results. Recently, our strawberry banana flavor of Lifeway Kefir gained
placement at select locations of our largest retail customer, with an estimated total of 1,000 stores once resets are complete in
the fourth quarter. We also anticipate that our ProBugs will gain incremental distribution at around 260 stores with a regional
retailer in December, and our Farmer Cheese will gain placement with a large national retailer in an estimated 1400 stores by the
end of the first quarter of 2025. We will continue to strategically evaluate opportunities to elevate the exposure of our core
Lifeway offerings. Interest in protein-rich foods with probiotics and bioavailable nutrients like Lifeway Kefir and Farmer Cheese is
higher than ever, and we believe that, in our 38-year history, our trajectory has never been stronger. 

Smolyansky continued, The strong third quarter performance extends
our track record of execution on our growth plan to consolidate our market leading position. Compared to the same period 5 years ago,
the year we initiated our Lifeway 2.0 Strategic Growth Plan, our year-to-date net sales and gross profit have grown by 98.4 and 115.3 ,
respectively, which has led to substantial shareholder value creation. We continued to deprioritize private label manufacturing during
the quarter, focusing on our branded products to protect Lifeway s category dominance and visibility, streamline operations and
further improve margins. As we continue to ship higher volumes of our Lifeway branded products, we will continue to realize manufacturing
efficiencies and favorable fixed cost absorption, driving operating leverage across the business. The whole Lifeway team has contributed
to our strong operational execution. We are on pace for record-breaking net sales in 2024, and I believe we are poised to continue this
excellent momentum into the fourth quarter and 2025. 

Third Quarter 2024 Results 

Net sales were 46.1 million for the third quarter
ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 5.2 million or 12.7 from the same period in 2023. The net sales increase was primarily driven
by higher volumes of our branded drinkable kefir. 

Gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 25.7 for the third quarter
ended September 30, 2024. 

 Selling, general and administrative expenses as
a percentage of net sales were 16.4 for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024. 

The Company reported net income of 3.0 million
or 0.20 per basic and 0.19 per diluted common share for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024.
