MALKA refers to Malka Media Group LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of MoneyLion Technologies Inc., and Engine refers to ML Enterprise Inc., doing business as the brand Engine by MoneyLion, a wholly-owned subsidiary of MoneyLion Technologies Inc. which was previously named Even Financial Inc. and subsequently renamed in February 2023. 
 
 For convenience, the trademarks and service marks referred to in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are listed without the , TM and SM symbols, but we intend to assert, and notify others of, our rights in and to these trademarks and service marks to the fullest extent under applicable law. 
 
 Reverse Stock Split 
 
 On April 24, 2023, the Company amended the Company's Fourth Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (as amended from time to time, the Certificate of Incorporation to effect, effective as of 5:01 p.m. Eastern Time on April 24, 2023, a 1-for-30 reverse stock split (the Reverse Stock Split of the Class A common stock, par value 0.0001 per share (the Class A Common Stock ). At the effective time of the Reverse Stock Split, every 30 shares of Class A Common Stock either issued and outstanding or held as treasury stock were automatically reclassified into one new share of Class A Common Stock, and the total number of shares of Class A Common Stock authorized for issuance was reduced by a corresponding proportion from 2,000,000,000 shares to 66,666,666 shares. The Reverse Stock Split was approved by the Company's stockholders at a Special Meeting of Stockholders on April 19, 2023 and approved by the Board of Directors on April 21, 2023. The primary goal of the Reverse Stock Split was to increase the per share price of the Class A Common Stock in order to meet the minimum per share price requirement for continued listing on the New York Stock Exchange (the NYSE ). The Class A Common Stock began trading on the NYSE on an as-adjusted basis on April 25, 2023 under the existing trading symbol ML. 
 
 In addition, as a result of the Reverse Stock Split, proportionate adjustments were made to the number of shares of Class A Common Stock underlying the Company s outstanding equity awards, the number of shares issuable upon the exercise of the Company s outstanding warrants and the number of shares issuable under the Company s equity incentive plans and certain existing agreements, as well as the exercise, grant and acquisition prices of such equity awards and warrants, as applicable. Furthermore, proportionate adjustments were made to the conversion factor at which the Company s previously outstanding Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, par value 0.0001 per share (the Series A Preferred Stock ), converted to Class A Common Stock. The total number of shares of preferred stock of the Company authorized for issuance remained at 200,000,000. Stockholders who would have been entitled to receive fractional shares as a result of the Reverse Stock Split were instead entitled to a cash payment in lieu thereof at a price equal to the fraction of one share to which the stockholder was otherwise entitled multiplied by the closing price per share of the Class A Common Stock on the NYSE on the effective date of the Reverse Stock Split. 
 
 The effects of the Reverse Stock Split have been reflected in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for all periods presented.

Risk Factor Summary 
 
 Our business is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including those we face in connection with the successful implementation of our strategy and the growth of our business. The following considerations, among others, may offset our competitive strengths or have a negative effect on our business strategy, which could cause a decline in the price of shares of our securities and result in a loss of all or a portion of your investment: 
 
 If we are unable to acquire new customers and clients, engage and retain our existing customers and clients or sell additional functionality, products and services to them on our platform, our business will be adversely affected. 

Any failure to effectively match consumer leads from our Channel Partners with product offerings from our Product Partners or any reduced marketing spend by such Product Partners on our Enterprise platform could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 

We depend on various third-party partners, service providers and vendors, and any adverse changes in our relationships with these third parties could materially and adversely affect our business, including if we fail to comply with applicable requirements of such third parties. 

Adverse publicity concerning us, our business or our personnel or our failure to maintain our brand in a cost-effective manner could materially and adversely affect our business. 

Demand for our products or services may decline if we do not continue to innovate or respond to evolving technology or other changes. 

If the information provided to us by customers or other third parties is incorrect or fraudulent, we may misjudge a customer s qualifications to receive our products and services and our results of operations may be harmed and could subject us to regulatory scrutiny or penalties. 

Any acquisitions, strategic investments, entries into new businesses, joint ventures, divestitures and other transactions could fail to achieve strategic objectives, disrupt our ongoing operations or result in operating difficulties, liabilities and expenses, harm its business and negatively impact our results of operations. 

We depend on our senior management team and other key personnel, and if we fail to attract, retain and motivate our personnel, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. 

If our existing funding arrangements are not renewed or replaced or our existing funding sources are unwilling or unable to provide funding to us on terms acceptable to us, or at all, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We may be unsuccessful in managing the effects of changes in the cost of capital on our business. 

We have a history of losses and may not achieve or maintain profitability in the future. 

Our risk management processes and procedures may not be effective. 

We operate in highly competitive industries, and our inability to compete successfully would materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 

Our business may be adversely affected by economic conditions and other factors, including adverse developments affecting financial institutions or the financial services industry generally, that we cannot control. 

Cyberattacks, data security breaches or other similar incidents or disruptions suffered by us or third parties upon which we rely could have a material adverse effect on our business, harm our reputation and expose us to public scrutiny or liability. 

v 

Defects, failures or disruptions in our systems or those of third parties upon which we rely and resulting interruptions in the availability of our platform could harm our business and financial condition, harm our reputation, result in significant costs to us and expose us to substantial liability. 

We may be unable to sufficiently obtain, maintain, protect or enforce our intellectual property and other proprietary rights, or we may be unable to obtain or maintain intellectual property, proprietary rights and technology licensed from third parties, which could reduce the value of our platform, products, services and brand, impair our competitive position and cause reputational harm. 

We have in the past, and continue to be, subject to inquiries, subpoenas, exams, pending investigations, enforcement matters and litigation by state and federal regulators, the outcomes of which are uncertain and could cause reputational and financial harm to our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 

Unfavorable outcomes in legal proceedings may harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 

If we are unable to develop and maintain an effective system of disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting, our ability to produce timely and accurate financial statements or comply with applicable regulations could be impaired. 

Our business is subject to extensive regulation, examination and oversight in a variety of areas, including registration and licensing requirements under federal, state and local laws and regulations. The legal and regulatory regimes governing certain of our products and services are uncertain and evolving. 

If we fail to operate in compliance with state or local licensing requirements, it could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 

The highly regulated environment in which our third-party financial institution partners operate may subject us to regulation and could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 

The collection, processing, use, storage, sharing and transmission of personally identifiable information PII and other sensitive data is subject to stringent and changing state and federal laws, regulations, standards and policies and could give rise to liabilities as a result of our failure or perceived failure to protect such data, comply with privacy and data protection laws and regulations or adhere to the privacy and data protection practices that we articulate to our customers. 

The market price of our securities, including the Class A Common Stock, may be volatile. Our failure to meet the continued listing requirements of the NYSE could result in a delisting of our securities. 

The risks described above should be read together with the Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements herein, any other risk factors set forth under Part II, Item 1A Risk Factors in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the Risk Factors section in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, our consolidated financial statements and the related notes presented in Part I, Item 1 Financial Statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and the other documents that we file with the SEC. Our business, prospects, financial condition or operating results could be harmed by any of these risks, as well as other risks not currently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial.

assets measured at fair value on a recurring or non-recurring basis as of September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023 except for consumer receivables held for sale (Level 2) which were measured at fair value on a recurring basis based on prices in markets that are not active for similar assets as of September 30, 2024 and are further described in Note 4, "Sale of Consumer Receivables." The Private Placement Warrants (as defined herein) were measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 and are further described in Note 13, Stock Warrants. The Company had liabilities measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis as of September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023 . There have been transfers between levels during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The Company also has financial instruments which are not measured at fair value. The Company has evaluated cash (Level 1), restricted cash (Level 1) and consumer receivables, net (Level 3) and believes the carrying value approximates the fair value due to the short-term nature of these balances. The carrying value of the secured loans approximates their fair value based on the relatively short duration these instruments have been outstanding and the secured loans' variable interest rate based on market rates. The carrying value of other debt approximates its fair value based on the relatively short duration these instruments have been outstanding and availability of alternative financing sources at similar interest rates with the same terms. The fair value of secured loans and other debt is based on Level 2 fair value measurements.

ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, which, along with subsequent related ASUs, creates a new credit impairment standard for financial assets measured at amortized cost and available-for-sale debt securities. The ASU requires financial assets measured at amortized cost (including loans, trade receivables and held-to-maturity debt securities) to be presented at the net amount expected to be collected, through an allowance for credit losses that are expected to occur over the remaining life of the asset, rather than incurred losses. The ASU requires that credit losses on available-for-sale debt securities be presented as an allowance rather than as a direct write-down. The measurement of credit losses for newly recognized financial assets (other than certain purchased assets) and subsequent changes in the allowance for credit losses are recorded in the statement of operations as the amounts expected to be collected change. The Company adopted ASU 2016-13 and the related subsequent ASUs effective , and applied the changes prospectively, recognizing a cumulative-effect adjustment to the beginning balance of retained earnings as of the adoption date. Upon adoption, the Company increased consumer receivables, net by , decreased enterprise receivables, net by and reduced accumulated deficit by .

Fees receivable represent the amounts due to the Company for tips and instant transfer fees related to the Instacash earned wage access product. Subscription receivables represent the amounts billed to customers for subscription services. The credit quality and future repayment of consumer receivables are dependent upon the customer s ability to perform under the terms of the agreement. Factors such as unemployment rates and housing values, among others, may impact the customer s ability to perform under the loan or Instacash advance terms though no direct correlation between charge-off rates and these factors has been identified in the Company's analysis. When assessing provision for losses on consumer receivables, the Company takes into account the composition and delinquency status of the outstanding consumer receivables and the related forecasted principal loss rates based on recent historical experience. Recent historical loss rates are updated on a quarterly basis. Charge-offs of consumer receivable balances occur after becoming 90 days past contractually due unless specific circumstances are identified on an individual or group of receivables that indicate charge-off is not appropriate. The level of exceptions to charge-offs occurring once 90 days past due is not material. Consumer receivable charge-offs typically occur within one year of origination. The tables below show consumer receivables balances as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 and the consumer receivables activity, charge-off rates and aging by product for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

 We have purposefully built our platform to help consumers navigate all of their financial inflection points, combining our deep first-party product expertise, engaging content, marketplaces, innovative technology, data and AI capabilities to create the ultimate marketplace solution. As of September 30, 2024, we had 18.7 million Total Customers who used 30.7 million Total Products and over 1,200 Enterprise Partners in our network.

Utilizing innovative approaches to financial guidance that engage and educate our users within a peer community, we seek to empower consumers to take control of their financial lives. 
 
 In our Consumer business, we primarily earn revenue as follows: 
 
 RoarMoney Banking : We earn revenue from interchange fees from payment networks based on customer expenditures on the debit card, as well as transaction volume-based incentive payments from the payment network. We also earn revenue from cardholder fees charged to our customers, such as an out-of-network ATM fee, a foreign transaction fee and instant transfer fees. Interchange fees, payment network payments and cardholder fees are reflected in banking revenue. As of November 1, 2024, we no longer charge a 1 monthly administrative fee on each RoarMoney account. 

Instacash : We earn revenue from optional tips and instant transfer fees, both reflected in banking revenue. 

Membership Programs : We earn revenue from the monthly subscription fee paid by our customers, which is reflected in membership subscription revenue. Membership programs also provide customers access to Credit Builder Loans from which we earn revenue from interest income, which is reflected in net interest income on finance receivables. 

MoneyLion Investing : We earn revenue from the monthly administration fee paid by our customers, which is reflected in other consumer revenue. 

25 

MoneyLion Crypto : We earn revenue from Zero Hash, which is reflected in other consumer revenue. Zero Hash pays us a share of the fees that they earn from our customers in exchange for us enabling Zero Hash to affect digital currency-related transactions for our customers. Strategically, we intend to wind down MoneyLion Crypto by the end of 2024 and expect to replace the offering with access to third-party cryptocurrency providers through our Consumer Marketplace. 

In our Enterprise business, we primarily earn revenue, reflected in enterprise service revenue, as follows: 
 
 Consumer Marketplace : We earn revenue from fees from our Product Partners based on a range of criteria depending on each Product Partner relationship, including, but not limited to, customers clicks, impressions, completed transactions or a share of revenue generated for the Product Partner. 

Enterprise Marketplace : We earn revenue from fees from our Enterprise Partners based on a range of criteria depending on each Enterprise Partner relationship, including, but not limited to, customers clicks, completed transactions or a share of revenue generated for the Product Partner. We also earn various SaaS and platform fees from our Enterprise Partners. 

Media Services : We earn revenue from our clients based on performance obligations within our contracts with them. 

Finance Receivable Servicing : We service Instacash receivables purchased from us in accordance with agreed upon servicing guidelines, collect and remit collections therefrom and provide certain reporting and other information relating to our servicing duties. We receive a fixed percentage of net collections. 

Recent Developments 
 
 In October 2024, we paid down the outstanding balance of the ROAR 1 SPV Credit Facility and terminated the facility. 
 
 In November 2024, we entered into the Third Amendment to Credit Agreement related to the ROAR 2 SPV Credit Facility (the Third Amendment ). The Third Amendment extended the maturity date of the ROAR 2 SPV Credit Facility by an additional six months to June 2026. 
 
 Factors Affecting Our Performance 
 
 We are subject to a number of risks including, but not limited to, the need for successful development of products, services and functionality; the need for additional capital (or financing) to fund operating losses; competition with substitute products and services from larger companies; protection of proprietary technology and information; dependence on key individuals; and risks associated with changes in information technology. For additional information, see the Risk Factors section in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 New Customer and Client Growth and Increasing Usage Across Existing Customers and Clients 
 
 Our ability to effectively acquire new customers and clients through our acquisition and marketing efforts and drive usage of our products and services across our existing customers and clients is key to our growth, particularly as a significant portion of the revenue we generate in our business is derived from transaction-based fees. We believe our customers experience is enhanced by using our full suite of first-party financial products and services, complemented by the full spectrum of offers available in our marketplace, as we can better tailor the insights and recommendations we provide to them. In order to grow our business, we must engage and retain customers and continue to expand their use of our platform by cross-selling additional functionality, products and services to them. In our Enterprise business, we are dependent in part on our relationships with our Enterprise Partners, and any failure to effectively match consumers leads from our Channel Partners with product and service offerings from our Product Partners, or any reduced marketing spend by such Product Partners on our Enterprise platform, could adversely affect our business and results of operations. 
 
 26 

Expansion and Innovation of Products, Services and Functionality 
 
 We will continue to invest in expanding and enhancing the products, services and functionality available through our platform for our customers and clients. Our ability to expand, enhance and sell additional functionality, products and services to our existing customers and clients may require more sophisticated and costly development, sales or engagement efforts. Any factors that impair our ability to do so may negatively impact our efforts towards retaining and attracting customers and clients. 
 
 General Economic and Market Conditions 
 
 Our performance is impacted by the relative strength of the overall economy, market volatility, consumer spending behavior and consumer demand for financial products and services. For example, with respect to our Consumer business, the willingness of our customers to spend, invest or borrow may fluctuate with their level of disposable income. Other factors such as interest rate fluctuations or monetary policies may also impact our customers behavior and our own ability to fund Instacash advances and loan volume. In addition, in our Enterprise business, adverse macroeconomic conditions, such as significant tightening of credit markets, may cause our Product Partners to reduce their marketing spend or advertising on our platform or may cause a reduction in client spending in our Media Services division, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations. 
 
 Seasonality 
 
 We may experience seasonal fluctuations in our revenue. During the fourth quarter, revenue in our Consumer business may benefit from increased consumer spending during the holiday season, which may increase demand for our advance product as consumers seek additional liquidity. During the first quarter, we may see stronger collections on Instacash receivables resulting in a relatively lower provision for credit losses on consumer receivables as a result of the impact of tax refunds, as well as stronger demand for our banking and investment products and services. Seasonal trends may be superseded by market or macroeconomic events, which can have a significant impact on our business, as described above. 
 
 Competition 
 
 We compete across our business lines with a variety of competitors, including traditional banks and credit unions; new entrants obtaining banking licenses; non-bank digital providers offering banking-related services; specialty finance and other non-bank digital providers offering consumer lending-related or earned wage access products; digital wealth management platforms such as robo-advisors offering consumer investment services and other brokerage-related services; and digital financial platform, embedded finance and marketplace competitors, which aggregate and connect consumers to financial product and service offerings. In addition to competing for customers for our product and service offerings, we also compete to attract viewership of the content to which we connect customers, as there are other sources of financial-related content and news, many of which are more established and have a larger subscriber base. Furthermore, we compete with other advertising agencies and other service providers to attract marketing budget spending from our Enterprise clients. With respect to our Media Services division, we compete with others in the digital media and content creation industry, which range from large and established media companies, including social media companies, advertising agencies and production studios, to emerging start-ups. We expect our competition to continue to increase. The success of our business depends on our ability to compete effectively and attract new and retain existing customers and clients, which depends upon many factors both within and beyond our control. 
 
 27 

Pricing of Our Products and Services 
 
 We derive a substantial portion of our revenue from fees earned from our products and services. The fees we earn are subject to a variety of external factors such as competition, interchange rates and other macroeconomic factors, such as interest rates and inflation, among others. We may provide discounts or other incentives and rewards that we pay to customers who utilize multiple products and services to expand usage of our platform. We may also lower pricing on our products and services to acquire new customers. As the market for our platform matures, or as new or existing competitors introduce new products, services or functionality that compete with ours, we may experience pricing pressure and be unable to retain current customers and clients and attract new customers and clients at prices that are consistent with our pricing model and operating budget. Our pricing strategy may prove to be unappealing to our customers and clients, and our competitors could choose to bundle certain products and services competitive with ours. If this were to occur, it is possible that we would have to change our pricing strategies or reduce our prices, which could adversely affect our business. 
 
 Product and Service Mix 
 
 We offer various products and services on our platform, including our core suite of first-party financial products and services, a broad range of financial and non-financial offers in our Consumer Marketplace, Enterprise Marketplace and Media Services in our Enterprise business. Each product and service has a different profitability profile. The relative usage of products and services with high or low profitability and their lifetime value could have an impact on our performance. 
 
 Access and Cost of Financing; Forward Flow Arrangement 
 
 Our credit products and Instacash product are financed by special purpose vehicle financings from third-party institutional lenders and, with respect to Instacash, a forward flow financing arrangement pursuant to which we sell a portion of our eligible Instacash receivables to third-party purchasers (the Purchase Agreement and receive a stable stream of servicing fee income, as described further under Part I, Item 1 Financial Statements Sale of Consumer Receivables. The loss of one or more of the financing sources we have for our credit products and Instacash product could have an adverse impact on our performance, and it could be costly to obtain new financing. In addition, the initial price at which we sell Instacash receivables under the Purchase Agreement is based on the average loss rate at 360 days past the repayment date of the three most recent matured monthly cohorts and is subject to adjustment for future monthly cohorts based on the performance of monthly cohorts at specified intervals past the repayment date compared to the expected loss rates of the reference matured monthly cohorts established at sale and a discount percentage. As a result, the loss on sale of the Instacash receivables sold under the Purchase Agreement is variable depending on the performance of the previously sold Instacash receivables. 
 
 Key Performance Metrics 
 
 We regularly review several metrics, including the following key metrics, to evaluate our business, measure our performance, identify trends affecting our business, formulate financial projections and make strategic decisions. 
 
 Total Customers 
 
 We define Total Customers as the cumulative number of customers that have opened at least one account, including banking, membership subscription, secured personal loan, Instacash advance, managed investment account, cryptocurrency account and customers that are monetized through our marketplace and affiliate products. Total Customers also include customers that have submitted for, received or clicked on at least one marketplace credit offer. We consider Total Customers to be a key performance metric as it can be used to understand lifecycle efforts of our customers, as we look to cross-sell products to our customer base and grow our platform. Total Customers were 18.7 million and 12.1 million as of September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 
 28 

Total Products 
 
 We define Total Products as the total number of products that our Total Customers have opened, including banking, membership subscription, secured personal loan, Instacash advance, managed investment account, cryptocurrency account and monetized marketplace and affiliate products, as well as customers who signed up for our financial tracking services (with either credit tracking enabled or external linked accounts), whether or not the customer is still registered for the product. Total Products also include marketplace credit offers that our Total Customers have submitted for, received or clicked on through our marketplace. If a customer has funded multiple secured personal loans or Instacash advances or opened multiple products through our marketplace, it is only counted once for each product type. We consider Total Products to be a key performance metric as it can be used to understand the usage of our products across our customer base. Total Products were 30.7 million and 20.3 million as of September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 
 Enterprise Partners 
 
 Enterprise Partners is comprised of Product Partners and Channel Partners. We define Product Partners as providers of the financial and non-financial products and services that we offer in our marketplaces, including financial institutions, financial services providers and other affiliate partners. We define Channel Partners as organizations that allow us to reach a wide base of consumers, including but not limited to news sites, content publishers, product comparison sites and financial institutions. Enterprise Partners were 1,271, comprising 622 Product Partners and 649 Channel Partners, and 1,126, comprising 508 Product Partners and 618 Channel Partners, as of September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 
 Total Originations 
 
 We define Total Originations as the dollar volume of the secured personal loans originated and Instacash advances funded within the stated period. We consider Total Originations to be a key performance metric as it can be used to measure the usage and engagement of the customers across our secured personal lending product and Instacash earned wage access product and is a significant driver of net interest income on finance receivables and banking revenue. Total Originations were 776 million and 564 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 2,264 million and 1,619 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. All originations were originated directly by MoneyLion.

 Management believes Adjusted EBITDA, a non-U.S. GAAP measure, provides relevant and useful information to investors regarding the performance of the company. Refer to the Non-GAAP Measures section below for further discussion of Adjusted EBITDA.

We generate revenue primarily from various product-related fees, providing membership subscriptions, performing enterprise services and originating loans. 
 
 Banking revenue 
 
 Banking revenue is generated by fees and payments relating to our RoarMoney Banking product and fees and tips relating to our Instacash product. 
 
 Banking revenue increased by 19.7 million, or 33.5 , to 78.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 58.9 million for the same period in 2023. The increase in banking revenue was driven by increases in fee income related to instant transfer fees and tips from Instacash advances of 20.3 million due to the growth of Instacash advances across both existing and new customers, which was partially offset by a 0.3 million decrease in revenue from a transaction volume-based incentive payment program from a third-party payment network and a 0.3 million decrease in cardholder and interchange fees from RoarMoney accounts compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Banking revenue increased by 64.2 million, or 37.9 , to 233.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 169.7 million for the same period in 2023. The increase in banking revenue was driven by increases in fee income related to instant transfer fees and tips from Instacash advances of 63.7 million due to the growth of Instacash advances across both existing and new customers, an increase in cardholder and interchange fees from RoarMoney accounts of 0.1 million due to an increased number of customers using RoarMoney and an increase of 0.5 million in revenue from a transaction volume-based incentive payment program from a third-party payment network compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 30 

Membership subscription revenue 
 
 Membership subscription revenue decreased by 0.7 million, or 8.3 , to 8.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 8.7 million for the same period in 2023. The decrease in membership subscription revenue was driven by a 0.8 million revenue reduction due to transitioning subscribers off legacy memberships. 
 
 Membership subscription revenue increased by 0.8 million, or 2.9 , to 26.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 26.1 million for the same period in 2023. The increase in membership subscription revenue was primarily driven by increased revenue from the WOW membership launched in January 2024, which was partially offset by revenue reductions due to transitioning subscribers off legacy memberships. 
 
 Net interest income on finance receivables 
 
 Net interest income on finance receivables is generated by interest earned on Credit Builder Loans, which is partially offset by the amortization of loan origination costs. 
 
 Net interest income on finance receivables increased by 0.1 million, or 3.4 , to 3.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 3.3 million for the same period in 2023. The increase in net interest income on finance receivables of 0.1 million was driven by higher average outstanding principal balances during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Net interest income on finance receivables decreased by 0.2 million, or 2.5 , to 9.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 9.5 million for the same period in 2023. The decrease in net interest income on finance receivables was primarily driven by a higher provision for past due interest collections of 0.3 million. 
 
 Other consumer revenue 
 
 Other consumer revenue consists of MoneyLion Investing and MoneyLion Crypto revenue and was 0.2 million and 0.7 million for the three and nine months, respectively, ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Enterprise service revenue 
 
 Enterprise service revenue increased by 6.1 million, or 15.6 , to 45.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 39.2 million for the same period in 2023. This increase was primarily driven by stronger performance within our Enterprise and Consumer Marketplaces and, to a lesser extent, new servicing fee revenue pursuant to the Purchase Agreement as we began transitioning to the forward flow financing arrangement, which was partially offset by lower performance within Media Services division. 
 
 Enterprise service revenue increased by 12.2 million, or 11.6 , to 116.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 104.4 million for the same period in 2023. This increase was primarily driven by stronger performance within our Enterprise Marketplace and, to a lesser extent, new servicing fee revenue pursuant to the Purchase Agreement as we began transitioning to the forward flow financing arrangement, which was partially offset by lower performance in our Consumer Marketplace and Media Services division.

Our operating expenses consist of the following: 
 
 Provision for credit losses on consumer receivables 
 
 Provision for credit losses on consumer receivables consists of amounts charged during the period to maintain an allowance for credit losses. The allowance represents management s estimate of the credit losses in our consumer receivable portfolio and is based on management s assessment of many factors, including changes in the nature, volume and risk characteristics of the consumer receivables portfolio, including trends in delinquency and charge-offs and current economic conditions that may affect the customer s ability to pay. 
 
 Provision for credit losses on consumer receivables increased by 1.7 million, or 6.8 , to 26.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 25.1 million for the same period in 2023. This resulted primarily from an increase to provision related to Instacash advance receivables of 4.9 million, which was partially offset by a decrease to provision related to Credit Builder Plus loan receivables of 2.2 million and a decrease to provision related to subscription fees of 1.1 million. 
 
 32 

Provision for credit losses on consumer receivables increased by 13.3 million, or 19.8 , to 80.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 67.2 million for the same period in 2023. This resulted primarily from an increase to provision related to Instacash advance receivables of 18.3 million, which was partially offset by a decrease to provision related to Credit Builder Plus loan receivables of 4.4 million and a decrease to provision related to subscription fees of 0.6 million. 
 
 Loss on sale of consumer receivables 
 
 Loss on sale of consumer receivables relating to the Instacash receivables sold under the Purchase Agreement was 3.3 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. There is no loss on sale of consumer receivables for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 as the Company entered into the Purchase Agreement during the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Compensation and benefits 
 
 Compensation and benefits increased by 2.3 million, or 9.8 , to 25.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 23.5 million for the same period in 2023. This increase was primarily driven by an increase in stock-based compensation of 1.6 million, an increase in employee salary and benefits expenses of 1.3 million and an increase in severance of 0.3 million. This was partially offset by a decrease in incentive compensation of 0.5 million due to a year to date catchup during the same period in 2023 and higher capitalized salaries of 0.4 million. 
 
 Compensation and benefits increased by 5.0 million, or 7.0 , to 75.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 70.5 million for the same period in 2023. This increase was primarily driven by an increase in stock-based compensation of 4.6 million, an increase in employee salary and benefits of 1.1 million, an increase in incentive compensation of 0.1 million due to company performance and an increase in severance costs of 0.6 million. This was partially offset by higher capitalized salaries of 1.4 million. 
 
 Marketing 
 
 Marketing increased by 3.6 million, or 50.7 , to 10.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 7.0 million for the same period in 2023. This increase resulted primarily from higher spend related to advertising through digital platforms and sponsorships. 
 
 Marketing increased by 12.0 million, or 60.2 , to 32.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 20.0 million for the same period in 2023. This increase resulted primarily from higher spend related to advertising through digital platforms and sponsorships. 
 
 Direct costs 
 
 Direct costs increased by 5.5 million, or 16.9 , to 38.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 32.8 million for the same period in 2023. The increase was primarily driven by 4.5 million of direct costs related to the growth of Enterprise revenue, an increase in payment processing fees of 0.9 million and a 0.2 million increase in costs related to our RoarMoney Banking and MoneyLion Investing offering. This was partially offset by a 0.1 million decrease in underwriting expenses. 
 
 Direct costs increased by 9.3 million, or 9.8 , to 104.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 94.8 million for the same period in 2023. The increase was primarily driven by 5.6 million of direct costs related to the growth of Enterprise revenue, an increase in payment processing fees of 3.4 million and an increase in underwriting expenses of 0.6 million, driven by growth in Total Originations and Total Customers, which was partially offset by a 0.2 million decrease in costs related to our RoarMoney Banking and MoneyLion Investing offering. 
 
 33 

Professional services 
 
 Professional services increased by 5.9 million, or 117.8 , to 10.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 5.0 million for the same period in 2023. This increase resulted primarily from an increase in outside legal expenses of 5.1 million, an increase in accounting and auditing fees of 0.5 million driven by regulatory compliance requirements and an increase in outside consulting expenses of 0.2 million. 
 
 Professional services increased by 13.1 million, or 90.5 , to 27.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 14.5 million for the same period in 2023.

 Technology-related costs 
 
 Technology-related costs increased by 1.4 million, or 24.3 , to 7.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 5.9 million for the same period in 2023. This increase resulted primarily from an increase in expenses for software licenses and subscriptions of 1.0 million and depreciation and amortization related to equipment and software of 0.4 million. 
 
 Technology-related costs increased by 2.9 million, or 16.4 , to 20.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 17.5 million for the same period in 2023.

 Other operating expenses 
 
 Other operating expenses decreased by 1.6 million, or 16.4 , to 8.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 9.8 million for the same period in 2023.

 Other operating expenses decreased by 7.2 million, or 23.8 , to 22.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 30.0 million for the same period in 2023. The decrease was primarily driven by lower costs related to legal matters of 7.0 million, a decrease in the provision for bad debts and increased recoveries of receivables in our Enterprise business of 0.9 million, a decrease in insurance expenses of 1.7 million, a decrease of 0.5 million in dues subscriptions, 0.2 million of lower depreciation and amortization of intangible assets and other assets, and 0.6 million decrease in other corporate expenses, which was partially offset by a 2.9 million increase in expenses related to processing transactions in our Consumer business and 0.9 million of higher facility expenses. 
 
 Our other (expense) income consists of the following: 
 
 Interest expense 
 
 Interest expense decreased by 0.6 million, or 8.2 , to 6.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 7.1 million for the same period in 2023. This decrease was primarily driven by a decrease in interest expense on secured debt of 0.7 million due to a decrease in average outstanding principal of secured debt and a decrease in the variable interest rate. See Part I, Item 1 Financial Statements Debt for more information. 
 
 Interest expense decreased by 1.9 million, or 8.6 , to 20.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 21.9 million for the same period in 2023. This decrease was primarily driven by a decrease in interest expense on secured debt of 2.3 million due to a decrease in average outstanding principal of secured debt and a decrease in the variable interest rate, which was partially offset by an increase of 0.5 million in interest expense on other debt due to an increase in the average outstanding principal of other debt. See Part I, Item 1 Financial Statements Debt for more information.

Change in fair value of warrant liability 
 
 Change in fair value of warrant liability was a benefit of 0.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to an expense of 0.1 million for the same period in 2023. The change in fair value of warrant liability was due to changes in inputs that drive the warrant liability fair value calculations. 
 
 Change in fair value of warrant liability was a benefit of 0.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to an expense of 0.1 million in 2023. The change in fair value of warrant liability was due to changes in inputs that drive the warrant liability fair value calculations. 
 
 Change in fair value of contingent consideration from mergers and acquisitions 
 
 There was no change in fair value of contingent consideration from mergers and acquisitions for the three or nine months ended September 30, 2024 since there was no unsettled contingent consideration outstanding during the three or nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Goodwill impairment loss 
 
 There was no goodwill impairment loss for the three or nine months ended September 30, 2024 since all goodwill had been written off by the end of the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 Other income 
 
 Other income increased by 0.3 million to 2.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to other income of 2.4 million for the same period in 2023. The increase was primarily driven by an increase in gains from foreign currency translation of 0.3 million. 
 
 Other income increased by 2.1 million to 7.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to other income of 5.3 million for the same period in 2023. The increase was primarily driven by an increase in interest income earned on interest bearing deposits of 1.1 million, lower losses on debt extinguishments of 0.5 million, an increase in rental income of 0.4 million and an increase in gains from foreign currency translation of 0.3 million. These increases were partially offset by a reduction in non-recurring trademark use settlement income of 0.2 million. 
 
 Income tax expense 
 
 See Part I, Item 1 Financial Statements Income Taxes for an explanation of the tax activity recorded during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Non-GAAP Measures 
 
 In addition to net (loss) income, which is a measure presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, management believes that Adjusted EBITDA provides relevant and useful information which is widely used by analysts, investors and competitors in our industry in assessing performance. Adjusted EBITDA is a supplemental measure of our performance that is neither required by nor presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as a substitute for U.S. GAAP metrics such as net (loss) income or any other performance measures derived in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may not be comparable to similar measures used by other companies. 
 
 We define Adjusted EBITDA as net (loss) income plus interest expense related to corporate debt, income tax expense (benefit), depreciation and amortization expense, change in fair value of warrant liability, change in fair value of contingent consideration from mergers and acquisitions, goodwill impairment loss, stock-based compensation expense and certain other expenses that management does not consider in measuring performance. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA provides a meaningful understanding of an aspect of profitability based on our current product portfolio. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA is useful to an investor in evaluating our performance because it: 
 35 

is a measure widely used by investors, analysts and competitors to measure a company s operating performance; 

is a metric used by rating agencies, lenders and other parties to evaluate our credit worthiness; and 

is used by our management for various purposes, including as a measure of performance and as a basis for strategic planning and forecasting. 

The reconciliation of net (loss) income to Adjusted EBITDA for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 is as follows:

Refer to the Cash Flows section below for further discussion on the net change in cash and restricted cash from operating activities, investing activities and financing activities during the period. 
 
 Consumer receivables, net 
 
 Consumer receivables, net increased by 12.3 million, or 7.1 , to 185.1 million as of September 30, 2024, as compared to 172.8 million as of December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in loan receivables, net of allowance for credit losses, of 18.5 million. The increase was partially offset by a decrease in Instacash receivables, net of allowance for credit losses, of 5.1 million. Refer to Part I, Item 1 Financial Statements Consumer Receivables for additional information. 
 
 Consumer receivables held for sale 
 
 Consumer receivables held for sale as of September 30, 2024 represent Instacash receivables that the Company originated and intends to sell under the Purchase Agreement. Consumer receivables held for sale are recorded at the lower of cost or fair value. 
 
 37 

Consumer receivables held for sale were 4.4 million as of September 30, 2024. There were no consumer receivables held for sale as of December 31, 2023 as the Company entered into the Purchase Agreement during the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Enterprise receivables, net 
 
 Enterprise receivables, net increased by 8.3 million, or 52.0 , to 24.3 million as of September 30, 2024, as compared to 16.0 million as of December 31, 2023. This increase was primarily attributable to an increase in Enterprise Marketplace receivables of 6.4 million, an increase in Consumer Marketplace receivables of 1.0 million and an increase in Media Services receivables of 0.9 million. 
 
 Intangible assets, net 
 
 Intangible assets, net decreased by 11.2 million, or 6.3 , to 165.4 million as of September 30, 2024, as compared to 176.5 million as of December 31, 2023.

 Other assets decreased by 20.3 million, or 37.9 , to 33.3 million as of September 30, 2024, as compared to 53.6 million as of December 31, 2023. This decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in the receivable from payment processors and a decrease in prepaid expenses, which was partially offset by an increase in operating lease right-of-use assets due to a lease of the Company s new corporate headquarters entered into during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Refer to Part I, Item 1 Financial Statements Other Assets for additional information. 
 
 Liabilities 
 
 Debt agreements 
 
 Debt agreements decreased by 18.7 million, or 9.8 , to 171.1 million as of September 30, 2024, as compared to 189.8 million as of December 31, 2023. Refer to Part I, Item 1 Financial Statements Debt for further discussion of financing transactions.

The increase was primary attributable to a 7.5 million dollar increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses related to increased operating costs which was partially offset by a reduction in litigation accruals of 5.3 million and taxes payable of 0.8 million. 
 
 Warrant liability 
 
 Warrant liability activity between September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was not significant. Refer to the Results of Operations for the Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 section above for further discussion on the change in fair value of warrant liability. 
 
 Other liabilities 
 
 Other liabilities increased by 8.1 million, or 54.0 , to 23.2 million as of September 30, 2024, as compared to 15.1 million as of December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily driven by an increase in operating lease liabilities due to a lease of the Company s new corporate headquarters entered into during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 38 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 We believe our existing cash and cash equivalents and cash flows from operating activities will be sufficient to meet our operating working capital needs for at least the next twelve months. Our future financing requirements will depend on several factors, including our growth, the timing and level of spending to support continued development of our platform, the expansion of marketing activities and merger and acquisition activity. In addition, growth of our finance receivables increases our liquidity needs, and any failure to meet those liquidity needs could adversely affect our business. Additional funds may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all. If the Company is unable to generate positive operating cash flows, additional debt and equity financings or refinancing of existing debt financings may be necessary to sustain future operations. 
 
 Receivables originated on our platform, including Credit Builder Loans and Instacash advances, were primarily financed through special purpose vehicle financings from third-party institutional lenders. As of September 30, 2024, there was an outstanding principal balance of 42.9 million under the ROAR 1 SPV Credit Facility and an outstanding principal balance of 64.5 million under the ROAR 2 SPV Credit Facility. For more information, see Note 7, Debt and Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the Company s Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 for discussion of the ROAR 1 SPV Credit Facility and the ROAR 2 SPV Credit Facility and VIE considerations related to the ROAR 1 SPV Credit Facility and the ROAR 2 SPV Credit Facility, respectively. 
 
 In the future, substantially all of our receivables for our Instacash product will be financed pursuant to the Purchase Agreement under which we will sell substantially all of our eligible Instacash receivables at a discount to third-party purchasers and receive a stable stream of servicing fee income based on net collections. For more information, see Part I, Item 1 Financial Statements Sale of Consumer Receivables.

Operating Activities 
 
 Net cash provided by operating activities was 60.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to net cash provided by operating activities of 36.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. This increase in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily driven by an increase in profitability, after adjusting for non-cash activity included in our net loss, of approximately 8.1 million and an increase of 16.2 million related to changes in working capital. 
 
 Net cash provided by operating activities was 141.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to net cash provided by operating activities of 74.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This increase in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily driven by an increase in profitability, after adjusting for non-cash activity included in our net income (loss), of approximately 50.4 million and an increase of 17.2 million related to changes in working capital. 
 
 Investing Activities 
 
 Net cash used in investing activities was 22.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to net cash used in investing activities of 28.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in net cash used in investing activities was primarily related to a decrease in cash used in net finance receivable originations and sales activity of 7.0 million, partially offset by increased spending on software development of 1.9 million. 
 
 Net cash used in investing activities was 96.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to net cash used in investing activities of 84.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in net cash used in investing activities was primarily related to increases in cash used in net finance receivable originations and sales activity of 9.5 million and increased spending on software development of 3.6 million, partially offset by reduced spending on settlement of contingent consideration related to mergers and acquisitions of 1.1 million. 
 
 Financing Activities 
 
 Net cash used in financing activities was 24.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to net cash used in financing activities of 9.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in net cash used for financing activities was primarily attributable to an increase in payments of debt principal of 13.6 million and repurchases of Class A Common Stock pursuant to the new Repurchase Program (as described below) of 1.0 million. 
 
 Net cash used in financing activities was 23.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to net cash used in financing activities of 42.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in net cash used in financing activities was primarily attributable to a decrease in payments of debt principal of 19.4 million and a decrease in preferred stock settlement payments of 3.0 million, which was partially offset by an increase of 2.6 million in cash used for tax payments owed on the vesting of stock compensation and an increase in repurchases of Class A Common Stock of 1.0 million. 
 
 Share Repurchase Program 
 
 On August 26, 2024, we announced that our Board of Directors had approved a share repurchase program with authorization to purchase up to 20 million of outstanding Class A Common Stock (the Repurchase Program ). 
 
 Under the Repurchase Program, we may repurchase from time to time shares of Class A Common Stock for cash through any manner, including open market transactions (including pursuant to broker plans in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 and Rule 10b-18), privately negotiated transactions with third parties or accelerated share repurchase agreements, and in such amounts as we deem appropriate, subject to legal requirements and other corporate considerations. 
 
 40 

The volume and timing of any repurchases will be subject to general market conditions, as well as our management of capital, other investment opportunities and other factors. The Repurchase Program does not obligate us to repurchase any specific dollar amount or number of shares, has no fixed expiration date and may be modified, suspended or discontinued at any time at our discretion. 
 
 We currently expect to fund the Repurchase Program from existing cash on hand and future cash flows. For additional information on purchases of Class A Common Stock under the Repurchase Program for the three months ended September 30, 2024, see Part II, Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities, Use of Proceeds and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities.

 For more information regarding our secured loans and other debt, see Part I, Item 1 Financial Statements Debt in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 
 At September 30, 2024, the Company did not have any material off-balance sheet arrangements. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 
 See Part I, Item 1 Financial Statements Summary of Significant Accounting Policies for a description of critical accounting policies and estimates. 
 
 Recently Issued and Adopted Accounting Pronouncements 
 
 See Part I, Item 1 Financial Statements Summary of Significant Accounting Policies for a description of recently issued accounting pronouncements that may potentially impact our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. 
 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 
 We are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business. Market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates. Our market risk exposure is primarily the result of fluctuations in interest rates. 
 
 41 

Interest Rates Risk 
 
 Interest rates may adversely impact our customers level of engagement on our platform and ability and willingness to pay outstanding amounts owed to us. While we do not charge interest on a lot of our products, higher interest rates could deter customers from utilizing our credit products and other loans. Moreover, higher interest rates may lead to increased delinquencies, charge-offs and allowances for loans and interest receivable, which could have an adverse effect on our operating results. 
 
 The Monroe Term Loans and future funding arrangements may bear a variable interest rate. The ROAR 1 SPV Credit Facility and ROAR 2 SPV Credit Facility have fixed interest rates. Given the fixed interest rates charged on many of our loans, a rising variable interest rate would reduce our interest margin earned in these funding arrangements. Dramatic increases in interest rates may make these forms of funding nonviable. A one percent change in the interest rate on our variable interest rate debt, based on principal balances as of September 30, 2024, would result in an approximately 0.7 million impact to annual interest expense. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 
 Material Weakness 
 
 During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, recently enhanced internal controls over our Credit Builder Loan product identified a population of cash disbursements made to customer escrow accounts that were not in accordance with the terms of the Credit Builder Loan product. While the financial reporting of these transactions was properly reported and no misstatements of our consolidated financial statements were identified, this control deficiency could result in improperly authorized disbursements of cash. Accordingly, we determined that this control deficiency constituted a material weakness. 
 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 Disclosure controls are procedures that are designed with the objective of ensuring that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act, such as this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time period specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls are also designed with the objective of ensuring that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including the Chief Executive Officer (Principal Executive Officer) and Chief Financial Officer (Principal Financial Officer), as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our management evaluated, with the participation of our current Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024, pursuant to Rule 13a-15(b) under the Exchange Act. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective in providing reasonable assurance that the information required for disclosure in reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act are recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms. As a result, we performed additional analysis as deemed necessary to ensure that our consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q were prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Accordingly, management believes that the financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q present fairly, in all material respects, our financial position, result of operations and cash flows for the periods presented. 
 
 42 

We do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all errors and all instances of fraud. Disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the disclosure controls and procedures are met. Further, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all disclosure controls and procedures, no evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures can provide absolute assurance that we have detected all our control deficiencies and instances of fraud, if any. The design of disclosure controls and procedures also is based partly on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting, other than as described below with respect to our ongoing remediation efforts. 
 
 In light of the material weakness identified, we are in the process of implementing additional controls intended to enhance our monitoring of cash disbursements and the information technology resources related to the Credit Builder Loan product. We continue to develop formal processes in consultation with our third-party professional advisors, including formalizing our control evidence and processes, that are intended to ensure a sufficient level of precision is embedded in all financial reporting control activities. In order to fully remediate the material weaknesses identified, we intend to continue to re-evaluate the design of, and validate, our internal controls to ensure that they appropriately address changes in our business that could impact our system of internal controls, review our current processes and procedures to identify potential control design enhancements to ensure that our financial reporting is complete and accurate and develop a monitoring protocol to enable management to validate the operating effectiveness of key controls over financial reporting. We believe that these actions will ultimately be effective in remediating the material weaknesses we have identified and will continue to evaluate our remediation efforts and report regularly to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors on the progress and results of our remediation plan. We intend to complete the remediation by June 30, 2025, but these remediation measures may be time consuming and costly, and there is no assurance that we will be able to complete the remediation and put in place the appropriate controls within this timeframe or that these initiatives will ultimately have the intended effects.

Part II OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 
 From time to time, we are subject to various claims and legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business, including lawsuits, arbitrations, class actions and other litigation. We are also the subject of various actions, inquiries, investigations and proceedings by regulatory and other governmental agencies. The outcome of any such legal and regulatory matters, including those discussed in this section, is inherently uncertain, and some of these matters may result in adverse judgments or awards, including penalties, injunctions or other relief, which could materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows. See Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors Risks Relating to Legal and Accounting Matters Unfavorable outcomes in legal proceedings may harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 We have determined, based on our current knowledge, that the aggregate amount or range of losses that are estimable with respect to our legal proceedings, including the matters described below, would not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows. As of September 30, 2024, amounts accrued were not material. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the ultimate outcome of legal proceedings involves judgments, estimates and inherent uncertainties, and cannot be predicted with certainty. It is possible that an adverse outcome of any matter could be material to our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows as a whole for any particular reporting period of occurrence. In addition, it is possible that a matter may prompt litigation or additional investigations or proceedings by other government agencies or private litigants. 
 
 State Regulatory Examinations and Investigations 
 
 We hold a number of state licenses in connection with our business activities, and must also comply with other applicable compliance and regulatory requirements in the states where we operate. In most states where we operate, one or more regulatory agencies have authority with respect to regulation and enforcement of our business activities under applicable state laws, and we may also be subject to the supervisory and examination authority of such state regulatory agencies. Examinations by state regulators have and may continue to result in findings or recommendations that require us, among other potential consequences, to provide refunds to customers or to modify our internal controls and/or business practices. 
 
 In the ordinary course of our business, we are and have been from time to time subject to, and may in the future be subject to, governmental and regulatory examinations, information requests, investigations and proceedings (both formal and informal) in connection with various aspects of our activities by state agencies, certain of which could result in adverse judgments, settlements, fines, penalties, restitution, disgorgement, injunctions or other relief. We have responded to and cooperated with the relevant state agencies and will continue to do so in the future, as appropriate.

CFPB Litigation 
 
 On September 29, 2022, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the CFPB initiated a civil action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York SDNY against MoneyLion Technologies Inc., ML Plus LLC and our 38 state lending subsidiaries, alleging violations of the Military Lending Act and the Consumer Financial Protection Act. The CFPB is seeking injunctive relief, redress for allegedly affected consumers and civil monetary penalties. On January 10, 2023, we moved to dismiss the lawsuit, asserting various constitutional and merits-based arguments. On June 13, 2023, the CFPB filed its first amended complaint, alleging substantially similar claims as those asserted in its initial complaint. On July 11, 2023, we moved to dismiss the lawsuit, again asserting various constitutional and merit-based arguments. On October 9, 2023, we moved for a stay of the action pending a decision from the United States Supreme Court in CFPB v. Community Financial Services Association of America, Ltd., No. 22-448 (U.S. argued Oct. 3, 2023) CFSA ). On December 1, 2023, the Court issued an order granting our motion and staying the action pending the United State Supreme Court s decision in CFSA . On May 16, 2024, the Supreme Court decided CFSA . Accordingly, our motion to dismiss is now pending with the SDNY. We continue to maintain that the CFPB s claims are meritless and are vigorously defending against the lawsuit. Nevertheless, at this time, we cannot predict or determine the timing or final outcome of this matter or the effect that any adverse determinations in the lawsuit may have on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 
 
 MALKA Seller Members Litigation 
 
 On July 21, 2023, Jeffrey Frommer, Lyusen Krubich, Daniel Fried and Pat Capra, the former equity owners of MALKA (collectively, the Seller Members ), brought a civil action in the SDNY against MoneyLion Technologies Inc. alleging, among other things, breaches of the Membership Interest Purchase Agreement (the MIPA governing our acquisition of MALKA. Among other claims, the Seller Members allege that they are entitled to payment of 25.0 million of Class A Common Stock pursuant to the earnout provisions set forth in the MIPA, based on the Seller Members assertion that MALKA achieved certain financial targets for the year ended December 31, 2022 (such payment, the 2022 Earnout Payment ). We believe that the Seller Members are not entitled to any portion of the 2022 Earnout Payment under the terms of the MIPA and filed counterclaims against the Seller Members, alleging, among other things, fraud, negligent misrepresentation, conversion, breach of fiduciary duties and breach of contract and seeking compensatory damages and other remedies as a result of wrongdoing by the Seller Members. On October 17, 2023, the SDNY denied, in full, the Seller Members motion for a preliminary injunction to remove the restrictive legends on certain shares of Class A Common Stock previously issued to the Seller Members. Separately, on November 3, 2023, the Seller Members moved to dismiss our amended counterclaims and third-party complaint. On May 14, 2024, the SDNY denied the Seller Members motion to dismiss with respect to our counterclaims alleging fraud, negligent misrepresentation, breach of fiduciary duty and certain conversion and breach of contract claims. The SDNY dismissed certain of our counterclaims relating to declaratory judgment, unjust enrichment and conversion as duplicative of our fraud and misrepresentation counterclaims, as well as certain other breach of contract counterclaims. We continue to vigorously pursue our remaining counterclaims and defend against the Seller Members claims, which we believe are meritless. However, at this time, we cannot predict or determine the timing or final outcome of this matter or the effect that any adverse determinations in the lawsuit may have on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 
 
 Former Series A Preferred Stockholders Litigation 
 
 As previously reported, on July 27, 2023, MassMutual Ventures US II LLC, Canaan X L.P., Canaan XI L.P., F-Prime Capital Partners Tech Fund LP and GreatPoint Ventures Innovation Fund II, L.P., each of which are former holders of the Company s Series A Preferred Stock (collectively, the Former Preferred Stockholders ), brought a civil action in the SDNY against MoneyLion Inc., our Board of Directors and certain officers asserting claims under Section 14(a) relating to the Definitive Proxy Statement we filed with the SEC on March 31, 2023 in connection with the Special Meeting of Stockholders relating to the 1-for-30 Reverse Stock Split of the Class A Common Stock effected on April 24, 2023 and related state law claims. On May 15, 2024, the SDNY granted our motion to dismiss the Former Preferred Stockholders complaint in its entirety. On June 14, 2024, Canaan X L.P., Canaan XI L.P. and GreatPoint Ventures Innovation Fund II, L.P. filed a notice of appeal with the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. On August 13, 2024, the parties filed a joint stipulation of voluntary dismissal, which resulted in the matter being withdrawn with prejudice. We believe the lawsuit is now fully resolved.

 Company certifies that it may offer Instant Trading to its Customers under Applicable Law. 

To the extent that Company s Customers are fully disclosed to DriveWealth: 

Customers who instant trade will be set up with Margin Accounts.

Some types of accounts are ineligible for the extension of leverage; and 

Company will deliver and continue to make available to its Customers DriveWealth s Margin Risk Disclosures, or other disclosures that DriveWealth makes available related to Instant Trading, and provide or otherwise make available to DriveWealth, in a manner mutually agreed between Company and DriveWealth, the audit trail or data sufficient to show such delivery; and

Failure to send the Settlement Amount will result in a Late Settlement Fee as described in the Prior Agreements or Fee Schedule, as applicable. Repeated failure to timely send funds sufficient to settle Transactions may constitute a Default by Company of the Prior Agreements. 

Clearing Deposit . By using Instant Trading and thereby agreeing to these Terms, Company allows DriveWealth to use the Clearing Deposit, as necessary 1) to settle transactions when funds sufficient to cover the Settlement Amount are not received, 2) for any other purposes necessary to enable Instant Trading, and 3) as may be further described in the Prior Agreements. 

Fees . In the event that the Settlement Amount is not received by Settlement Cutoff, and DriveWealth must use alternate funds to settle Transactions, including use of the Clearing Deposit, Company will trigger the Late Settlement Fee, as described in the Prior Agreements or Fee Schedule, as applicable. 

Net Trading Limits . If Net Trading reaches certain levels Net Trading Limits, as communicated by DriveWealth in writing), DriveWealth reserves the right to take action including immediately cutting off or limiting trading. DriveWealth will determine the Net Trading Limits based on a variety of risk factors, and will review the Net Trading Limits on an ongoing basis to determine whether adjustments are necessary. 

Company understands and acknowledges that DriveWealth may rely on Company s certifications, acknowledgments, and representations contained within these Terms. Company acknowledges that it has an ongoing obligation to notify DriveWealth if any of its certifications, acknowledgements or representations are no longer accurate.
