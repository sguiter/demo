million and million of
revenues for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2024, respectively, however the Company expects to continue to
experience recurring losses and to generate negative cash flows from operating activities in the near future. 

The
Company incurred a net income attributable to PAVmed Inc. common stockholders of approximately million and had net cash flows used
in operating activities of approximately million for the nine month period ended September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024,
the Company had negative working capital of approximately million, with such working capital inclusive of the Senior Secured Convertible
Notes classified as a current liability of an aggregate of approximately million and approximately million of cash. 

The
Company s ability to continue operations 12 months beyond the issuance of the financial statements, will depend upon its
ability to control its operating costs within the limits of the amounts collected from its management service contracts with its
non-consolidated subsidiaries, to substantially increase its revenues from the Veris Cancer Care platform, and to raise additional
capital through various potential sources including equity or debt financings or refinancing or restructuring existing debt
obligations. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern within one year
after the date the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements are issued.

In
October 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-06, Disclosure Improvements: Codification Amendments in Response to the SEC s Disclosure
Update and Simplification Initiative. This update modifies the disclosure or presentation requirements of a variety of topics in the
Accounting Standards Codification to conform with certain SEC amendments in Release No. 33-10532, Disclosure Update and Simplification.
The amendments in this update should be applied prospectively, and the effective date for each amendment will be the date on which the
SEC s removal of that related disclosure from Regulation S-X or S-K becomes effective. However, if the SEC has not removed the
related disclosure from its regulations by June 30, 2027, the amendments will be removed from the Codification and not become effective.
Early adoption is prohibited. The Company is currently evaluating the impact this update will have on its unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements and disclosures.

value attributable to both observable (e.g., changes in market interest rates) and unobservable (e.g., changes in unobservable long-
dated volatilities) inputs.

and analyses, including the respective common stock prices, as compared to the floor price on conversions, the dividend yields, the risk-free
rates based on U.S. Treasury security yields, and certain other Level-3 inputs including, assumptions regarding the estimated volatility
in the value of the respective common stock prices. Changes in these assumptions can materially affect the recognized estimated fair
values.

Overview 

PAVmed
is a multi-product life sciences company organized to advance a pipeline of innovative healthcare technologies. Led
by a team of highly skilled personnel with a track record of bringing innovative products to market, PAVmed is focused on innovating,
developing, acquiring, and commercializing novel products that target unmet needs with large addressable market opportunities. Leveraging
our corporate structure a parent company that will establish distinct subsidiaries for each financed asset we have the flexibility
to raise capital at the PAVmed level to fund product development, or to structure financing directly into each subsidiary in a manner
tailored to the applicable product, the latter of which is our current strategy given prevailing market conditions. 

Our
current focus is multi-fold. We continue to pursue commercial expansion and execution of EsoGuard, which is the flagship product of
our of our subsidiaries, Lucid Diagnostics (Nasdaq: LUCD). We also are continuing to advance the commercialization of the Veris
Cancer Care Platform, which is the lead product of another of our subsidiaries, Veris Health. We are focused in the immediate term
on entering into strategic partnership opportunities with leading academic oncology systems to expand access to the Veris Platform, while concurrently developing an implantable physiological monitor, designed to be implanted alongside a chemotherapy
port, which will interface with the Veris Platform.
In terms of other existing products and technologies, we have created an incubator-type platform where we are looking to obtain
financing on a product-by-product basis as necessary to advance each asset to a meaningful inflection point along its path to
commercialization. Finally, as resources permit, we will continue to explore external innovations that fulfill our project selection
criteria without limiting ourselves to any target sector, specialty or condition. 

See
 Part I, Item 1, Business , in the Form 10-K for a more detailed summary of the medical device, diagnostics, and digital
health sectors and our key products, including in particular EsoGuard and the Veris Platform, which are currently our two leading products. 

Recent
Developments 

Business 

Changes to PAVmed Board Composition 

Effective as of September 10, 2024,
James L. Cox, M.D., and Joan B. Harvey resigned from the Company s board of directors. Neither Dr. Cox s nor Ms. Harvey s
resignation was due to any disagreement with the Company on any matter relating to its operations, policies or practices. 

Also effective as of September 10,
2024, the Company s board of directors appointed Sundeep Agrawal, M.D. as a Class B director. Prior to being appointed to the Company s
board of directors, Dr. Agrawal had entered into a strategic advisory agreement with the Company to provide certain M A advisory services.
Such agreement will remain in effect upon Dr. Agrawal joining the board. Pursuant to the agreement, Dr. Agrawal will receive a monthly
consulting fee of 3,333. The agreement is terminable by the Company on 10 days written notice. Except for the foregoing, Dr. Agrawal
has not engaged in any transactions with the Company that are required to be reported pursuant to Item 404(a) of Regulation S-K. 

Lucid American Journal of Gastroenterology Publication 

On November 7, 2024, Lucid announced
that its manuscript for its multi-center ESOGUARD BE-1 study has been accepted for publication in The American Journal of Gastroenterology,
the official journal of the American College of Gastroenterology (ACG). This is the fourth publication presenting clinical validation
data for Lucid s EsoGuard Esophageal DNA Test, and the second to demonstrate its performance in an intended-use screening population.
Consistent with previous studies, EsoGuard showed high sensitivity and negative predictive value in detecting esophageal precancer (Barrett s
Esophagus or BE). With the acceptance for publication of Lucid believes it now has a complete clinical evidence package to submit its
data to the MolDX program and formally seek Medicare coverage. 

The prospective, multi-center study
presented data from a cohort of patients who met ACG guideline criteria for esophageal precancer screening and underwent non-endoscopic
EsoGuard testing followed by traditional upper endoscopy. EsoGuard sensitivity and negative predictive value for detecting BE were approximately
88 and 99 , respectively. Specificity and positive predictive value were approximately 81 and 30 , respectively. No serious adverse
events were reported. 

Lucid IP Matters 

On October 15, 2024, the Company
announced that Lucid received a Notice of Allowance from the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) for a patent application
covering its proprietary method of using methylation of the cyclin-A1 (CCNA1) gene to help detect esophageal precancer and cancer, a key
component of its EsoGuard Esophageal DNA Test. 

EsoGuard utilizes next-generation
sequencing (NGS) to assess DNA methylation at 31 sites on two genes, vimentin (VIM) and cyclin-A1 (CCNA1). Such methylation has been shown
to be strongly associated with conditions along the spectrum from early esophageal precancer (non-dysplastic Barrett s Esophagus
or BE), to late precancer (dysplastic BE), to cancer (esophageal adenocarcinoma). Although VIM methylation had been previously associated
with gastrointestinal neoplasias, the association of CCNA1 methylation with esophageal neoplasia is novel and appears to be more specific. 

Veris NIH Grant 

On October 10, 2024, the Company
announced that Veris had been awarded a 1.8 million grant from the National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities (NIMHD),
an institute of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). The two-year grant will fund research to optimize and validate the Veris Cancer
Care Platform for the needs of medically underserved cancer patients, in partnership with an academic cancer center. The research project,
 Bridging the Gap: Enhancing Cancer Care for Underserved Populations with the Veris Health Cancer Care Platform, will focus
on patients facing language barriers, limited access to technology, and socioeconomic disparities. 

Veris Cancer Care Platform 

On June 13, 2024, we announced that Veris and a National Cancer Institute-Designated
Comprehensive Cancer Center launched a pilot program and has enrolled the first patients from such center in such program on the Veris
Cancer Care Platform. 

PAVmed
Distribution of Lucid Diagnostics Common Stock to Shareholders 

On
February 15, 2024, the Company distributed by special dividend to the Company stockholders 3,331,747 shares of Lucid Diagnostics common
stock held by the Company. On such date, each PAVmed shareholder as of the January 15, 2024 record date received a stock dividend of
approximately 38 shares of Lucid common stock for every 100 shares of PAVmed common stock they held as of such date. The shares distributed
were approximately equal to the number of shares of common stock that Lucid issued to PAVmed on or about January 26, 2024 in satisfaction
of certain intercompany obligations due to Lucid from PAVmed, as discussed above. 

This
distribution constituted an Extraordinary Dividend as defined in the warrant agreement that governs the Company s
Series Z Warrants. As a result, pursuant to the warrant agreement, the exercise price under the Series Z Warrants per full share of PAVmed
common stock was automatically decreased by 0.52 (the fair market value of 0.37709668 of a share of Lucid Diagnostics common
stock as of the date of the distribution) to 23.48 per share. 

Management
Services Agreement/Payroll Benefits and Expense Reimbursement Agreement with Lucid Diagnostics 

On
August 6, 2024, PAVmed and Lucid entered into a ninth amendment to the management services agreement between PAVmed and Lucid MSA to increase the monthly fee thereunder from 0.83 million per month to 1.05 million per month, effective as of July 1, 2024. 

On
March 22, 2024, PAVmed and Lucid entered into an eighth amendment to MSA to increase the monthly fee thereunder from 0.75 million per
month to 0.83 million per month, effective as of January 1, 2024. The amendment also reset the maximum number of shares issuable under
the agreement to 19.99 of the shares outstanding as of the date of the amendment. 

On
January 26, 2024, in accordance with the MSA and the payroll, benefits and expense reimbursement agreement between PAVmed and Lucid PBERA ),
PAVmed elected to receive payment of approximately 4.7 million of fees and reimbursements accrued under the MSA and the PBERA through
the issuance of 3,331,771 shares of Lucid s common stock.

Incubator
Program 

On
March 21, 2024, the Company announced that it has launched a wholly owned incubator, PMX, to complete development and commercialization
of existing portfolio technologies, including PortIO, EsoCure and CarpX. PMX and Hatch Medical, L.L.C. Hatch Medical ),
a medical device incubator and technology brokerage firm, have executed a joint venture agreement to advance the technologies. 

Pursuant
to the joint venture agreement, PAVmed will assign PortIO, EsoCure and CarpX to its wholly owned incubator, PMX. Starting with PortIO,
the Company will seek to independently finance a separate subsidiary of the incubator to develop and commercialize each technology. Hatch
Medical will provide strategic advisory and brokerage services to the subsidiary to advance the technology through key milestones and,
subsequently, seek to engage a strategic partner to acquire, license or distribute the commercial product. The Company has an agreed upon term sheet for PortIO with a network of angel investors that is based on a pre-money
valuation of PortIO of 42 million, and due diligence by the investors is ongoing, although there can be no assurance that such transaction
will be consummated. 

FDA
Enforcement Discretion 

In
April 2024, FDA published the final rule under which FDA intends to phase out its general enforcement discretion approach for LDTs
so that IVDs manufactured by a laboratory would generally fall under the same enforcement approach as other IVDs (the proposed rule
was published in October 2023). In the final rule, FDA has expanded the categories of LDTs that will be eligible for continued
enforcement discretion, which include LDTs first marketed prior to May 6, 2024 and LDTs approved by New York State s Clinical
Laboratory Evaluation Program (NYS CLEP). As EsoGuard was marketed prior to the May 6, 2024, and is also NYS CLEP-approved, EsoGuard
remains under continued enforcement discretion from FDA s premarket review requirements and quality systems requirements
(except for record-keeping). As such, there is no immediate impact from the final rule on EsoGuard s regulatory
strategy.

Extension to Regain Compliance with Nasdaq Listing
Rules to January 31, 2025 

On November 8, 2024, a Nasdaq Hearings Panel (the Panel granted the Company an extension, until January 31, 2025, to regain
compliance with the Nasdaq continued listing standards. 

As previously disclosed, on March
7, 2024, the Company received a notice from the Listing Qualifications Department of The Nasdaq Stock Market Nasdaq stating

been below the minimum of 35 million required for continued inclusion on the Nasdaq Capital Market under Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b)(2).
The Company was provided 180 calendar days, or until September 3, 2024, to regain compliance with the rule. The Company did not regain
compliance with the rule during the allotted time period. Accordingly, on September 10, 2024, the Company received a staff determination
letter from the Nasdaq Listing Qualifications Department, stating that unless the Company timely requested a hearing before the
Panel to appeal the staff determination, the Company s securities would be subject to suspension and delisting.
The Company timely requested a hearing before the Panel, which was held on October 29, 2024. 

During the extension granted by the Panel, the Company s common stock
and Series Z warrants will continue to trade uninterrupted under the symbol PAVM and PAVMZ , respectively. 

Extension
of Senior Convertible Notes; Waiver 

Effective
as of March 12, 2024, the Company entered into an amendment and waiver (the Note Amendment and Waiver with the holder
of the April 2022 Senior Convertible Note and the September 2022 Senior Convertible Note (each as defined in Liquidity and
Capital Resources below). Pursuant to the Note Amendment and Waiver, the maturity date of the April 2022 Senior
Convertible Note was extended to April 4, 2025 and the maturity date of the September 2022 Senior Convertible Note was extended to
September 8, 2025, in each case subject to further extension in certain circumstances. The holder of the such note also waived, for

mutually agreed in writing), which currently is included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the Company s
unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets as of September 30, 2024. 

In addition, from time to time
from and after September 1, 2024 through November 11, 2024, the Company was not in compliance with the Financial Tests. As of November
11, 2024, the Investor agreed to waive any such non-compliance during such time period and thereafter through December 31, 2024.

Lucid
Diagnostics - Preferred Stock Offerings 

On
March 13, 2024, Lucid entered into subscription agreements (each, a Lucid Series B Subscription Agreement and
exchange agreements (each, a Lucid Series B Exchange Agreement with certain accredited investors (collectively, the
 Lucid Series B Investors ), which agreements provided for (i) the sale to the Lucid Series B Investors of 12,495 shares

Lucid Series B Exchange Agreements, Lucid entered into subscription agreements with certain of the Lucid Series B Investors
providing for the sale to such investors of 5,670 shares of Lucid Series A-1 Preferred Stock, at a purchase price of 1,000 per

In
December 2021, we entered into an at-the-market offering for up to 50 million of our common stock that may be offered
and sold under a Controlled Equity Offering Agreement between us and Cantor Fitzgerald Co. Cantor ). In March 2023,
the at-the-market offering became subject to General Instruction I.B.6 of Form S-3, which limits sales of our securities
under this instruction in any 12-month period to one-third of the aggregate market value of our public float (unless our public float
rises to 75 million or more, in which case the instruction will cease to apply). As a result of this limitation and our then-current
public float, in May 2023, we amended our at-the-market offering to cover up to 18 million of our common stock. In the
nine month period ended September 30, 2024, the Company sold 627,302 shares through its at-the-market equity facility for net proceeds
of approximately 1.0 million, after payment of 3 commissions. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had approximately 15.1 million

Results
of Operations 

Overview 

Revenue 

The
Company recognized revenue primarily resulting from the delivery of patient EsoGuard test results when the Company considered the
collection of such consideration to be probable to the extent that it is unconstrained. 

Cost
of revenue 

Cost
of revenues recognized primarily from the delivery of patient EsoGuard test results includes costs related to EsoCheck device usage,
shipment of test collection kits, royalties and the cost of services to process tests and provide results to physicians. We have incurred
expenses for tests in the period in which the activities occur, therefore, gross margin as a percentage of revenue has varied from
quarter to quarter due to costs being incurred in one period that relate to revenues recognized in a later period. 

We
expect that gross margin for our services will fluctuate based on the commercialization efforts of our majority-owned subsidiaries. 

Sales
and marketing expenses 

Sales
and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs for employees engaged in sales, sales support and marketing
activities, as well as advertising and promotion expenses. We anticipate our sales and marketing expenses to decrease in the future
compared to historical periods due to the deconsolidation of Lucid, as the sales and marketing operations for the Lucid EsoGuard test is no longer recorded within the Company s operating results. 

General
and administrative expenses 

General
and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs for personnel, travel expenses, facility-related costs, professional
fees for accounting, tax, audit and legal services, salaries and related costs for employees involved in third-party payor reimbursement
contract negotiations and consulting fees and other expenses associated with obtaining and maintaining patents within our intellectual
property portfolio. 

We
anticipate our general and administrative expenses will decrease in the future compared to historical periods due to the deconsolidation of Lucid as the general and administrative
expenses, including third-party payor reimbursement costs, incurred by Lucid will no longer be recorded within the Company s operating
results. In the future, general and administrative expenses will include those expenses related to being a public company, including fees and expenses for audit, legal, regulatory, tax-related
services, insurance premiums and investor relations costs associated with maintaining compliance as a public company for PAVmed and its majority-owned subsidiaries. 

Research
and development expenses 

Research
and development expenses are recognized in the period they are incurred and consist principally of internal and external expenses incurred
for the development of our products, including: 

consulting
 costs for engineering design and development; 

salary
 and benefit costs associated with our medical research personnel and engineering personnel; 

costs
 associated with regulatory filings; 

patent
 license fees; 

cost
 of laboratory supplies and acquiring, developing, and manufacturing preclinical prototypes; 

product
 design engineering studies; and 

expenses
 for facilities maintained solely for research and development purposes. 

The reported research and development activities, including our clinical trials, were focused principally on the acceleration of EsoGuard and
Veris Cancer Care Platform commercialization. In the future, the research and development activities will focus on the Veris Cancer Care Platform, the PMX incubator program and other products in our
pipeline as well as applicable new technologies, as resources permit. 

Other
Income and Expense, net 

Other
income and expense, net, consists principally of changes in fair value of our convertible notes and losses on extinguishment of debt
upon repayment of such convertible notes.

The
three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to three months ended September 30, 2023 

Revenue 

In
the three months ended September 30, 2024, revenue was 1.0 million as compared to 0.8 million for the corresponding period in the prior
year. The 0.2 million increase principally relates to the increase in volume of our EsoGuard Esophageal DNA Tests performed in our own
CLIA laboratory for the period and the consideration received for the performance of the EsoGuard Esophageal DNA Tests.

on Debt Extinguishment 

In
the three months ended September 30, 2024, a debt extinguishment loss in the aggregate of approximately 1.4 million was recognized in

 of interest expense thereon, were settled through the issuance of 509,942 shares of common stock of the Company, with such shares
 having a fair value of approximately 0.9 million (with such fair value measured as the respective conversion date quoted closing
 price of the common stock of the Company). In addition, the Company agreed to pay 0.7 million in cash related to acceleration floor
 payments on these notes related to the conversion price being below the floor, recorded as debt extinguishment loss. The conversions
 and floor acceleration payments resulted in a debt extinguishment loss of 1.1 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024. 

During
 the period of July 1, 2024 through September 10, 2024, the date of PAVmed s deconsolidation, approximately 0.8 million of

Gain
on Deconsolidation of Lucid 

As
of September 30, 2024, there were 51,597,718 shares of common stock of Lucid Diagnostics issued and outstanding, of which, the
Company held 31,302,444 shares. On September 10, 2024, as a result of certain changes in the composition of the Company s
board of directors as described above, in combination with the Company ceasing to have control over a majority of the voting power
of Lucid, the Company was considered to cease to have control over Lucid for the purposes of U.S. GAAP, even though it continues to
own, and has not disposed any of its, 31,302,444 shares of common stock of Lucid. However, PAVmed retained the ability to exercise
significant influence over Lucid. Upon deconsolidation, the Company s ownership of 31,302,444 shares of Lucid Diagnostics, Inc

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

Our
current financing strategy is to obtain capital directly into Lucid, Veris and other subsidiaries to fund any product development or
other related activities, although we retain the flexibility to raise capital at the PAVmed level. There are no assurances, however, we will be able to obtain an adequate level of financial resources required
for the short-term or long-term commercialization and development of our products and services. 

We
have financed our operations principally through the public and private issuances of our common stock, preferred stock, common stock
purchase warrants, and debt, both at the PAVmed level and, in the case of Lucid, at the subsidiary level. We are subject to all of the risks and uncertainties typically faced by medical device and diagnostic and
medical device companies that devote substantially all of their efforts to the commercialization of their initial product and services
and ongoing R D and clinical trials. We experienced net income before noncontrolling interests of approximately 27.3 million and
used approximately 33.6 million of cash in operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Financing activities provided 31.0
million of cash during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. We ended the quarter with cash on-hand of 0.8 million as of September
30, 2024. We expect to continue to experience recurring losses and negative cash flows from operations, and will continue to fund our
operations with debt and/or equity financing transactions, including current obligations on the Company s existing convertible
debt which in accordance with management s plans may include conversions to equity and refinancing our existing debt obligations
to extend the maturity date. The Company s ability to continue operations 12 months beyond the issuance of the financial statements
will depend upon generating substantial revenue that is conditioned on obtaining positive third-party reimbursement coverage for its
EsoGuard Esophageal DNA Test from both government and private health insurance providers, increasing revenue through contracting directly
with self-insured employers, and on its ability to raise additional capital through various potential sources including equity and/or
debt financings or refinancing existing debt obligations. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to
continue as a going concern within one year after the date the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements are
issued. 

Issue
of Shares of Our Common Stock 

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2024

agreed to extend by one year, to September 8, 2025. The September 2022 Senior Convertible Note may be converted into or otherwise paid

was not in compliance with the Financial Tests. As of November 11, 2024, the investor agreed to waive any such non-compliance during such
time period and thereafter through December 31, 2024. Based on the waiver, as of September 30, 2024, the Company was in compliance with
the Financial Tests. In addition, based on the waiver, the Company presently is in compliance with the Financial Tests.

Critical
Accounting Estimates 

The
discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our unaudited condensed consolidated financial
statements, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America U.S.
GAAP ). The preparation of these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the amounts reporting in our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. On an ongoing
basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgements. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, we base our estimates on historical experience and on

4. Controls and Procedures 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Our
management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness
of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. Based on such evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal
financial officer concluded our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act)
were effective as of such date to provide reasonable assurance the information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file
or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s
rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure information
required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management,
including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure. 

Changes
to Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting 

There
has been no change in internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act)
that occurred during our fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially
affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
