SusGlobal Energy Corp. 
 Notes to the Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements 
 September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 (Expressed in United States Dollars) 
 (unaudited) 

(2023- for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and as at that date had a working capital deficit of (December 31, 2023- and an accumulated deficit of (December 31, 2023- and expects to incur further losses in the development of its business. 
 On November 3, 2023, the funds previously held in escrow, which related to a full and final mutual release of all obligations owing to PACE, including accrued interest, in the amount of (C ), were released to PACE (now Alterna) and Alterna released all security it held to the Company. Prior to this full and final mutual release the obligations owing to PACE, including accrued interest were (C ). The Company transferred a 1st mortgage, originally a vendor take-back mortgage with a maturity date of August 17, 2023 to a new mortgage with a new maturity date of December 14, 2024. On January 10, 2024, the Company stopped receiving waste at its waste processing and composting operation in Belleville, Ontario Canada, to address several non-compliance matters described in orders from the Ministry of the Environment, Conservation and Parks (the "MECP"). The Company continues to seek investors to raise funds through debt or equity. 

These factors cast substantial doubt as to the Company's ability to continue as a going concern, which is dependent upon its ability to obtain the necessary financing to further the development of its business, satisfy its obligations to its creditors, and upon achieving profitable operations through revenue growth. There is no assurance of funding being available or available on acceptable terms. Realization values may be substantially different from carrying values as shown. 
 These interim condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result if the Company was unable to continue as a going concern. 

As at September 30, 2024, the Company is not exposed to concentration risk as it had no customers (December 31, 2023- customers) representing 
 and no customer (December 31, 2023- customers) represented (December 31, 2023- of trade receivables. The Company had certain customers whose revenue individually represented 
 . These customers accounted for , and (September 30, 2023- ; , , and of total revenue. 
 Liquidity Risk 
 Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company will be unable to meet its obligations as they fall due. The Company takes steps to ensure it has sufficient working capital and available sources of financing to meet future cash requirements for capital programs and operations. Management is considering all its options to repay its creditors. Refer also to going concern, note 2. 
 The Company actively monitors its liquidity to ensure that its cash flows and working capital are adequate to support its financial obligations and the Company's capital programs. To continue operations, the Company will need to raise capital and complete the refinancing of its real property and organic waste processing and composting facility located at 704 Phillipston Road, Roslin, Ontario, Canada (the "Belleville Facility"). There is no assurance of funding being available or available on acceptable terms. Realization values may be substantially different from carrying values as shown. Refer also to going concern, note 2. 
 Currency Risk 
 Although the Company's functional currency is the C , the Company realizes a portion of its expenses in United States Dollars (" "). Consequently, certain assets and liabilities are exposed to foreign currency fluctuations. As at September 30, 2024, (December 31, 2023- of the Company's net monetary liabilities were denominated in . The Company has not entered into any hedging transactions to reduce the exposure to currency risk. 

(December 31, 2023- ). The professional services disclosed under stock-based compensation related to general corporate consulting, marketing, branding and commercialization to market, and general investor relations services. The common shares issued for professional services are also noted under capital stock, note 14. The balance consists of costs and deposits for services expiring or relating to periods after September 30, 2024, including insurance, rent and professional services retainers.

 Long-lived Assets-held for sale 
 On July 28, 2024, the Company's real estate broker listed the Company's two properties located in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada, (the "Hamilton Facility") for sale. On the recommendation of the real estate broker, there was no selling price noted. 
 In accordance with ASC 205-20, a disposal of a component or a group of components should be reported in discontinued operations if the disposal represents a strategic shift that has (or will have) a major effect on an entity's operations and financial results when a component of or group of components meets the initial criteria for classification of held for sale to be classified as held for sale. Per the initial criteria for classification of held for sale, a component or a group of components, or a business or nonprofit activity (the entity to be sold), should be classified as held for sale in the period in which all of the following criteria are met: 

Management, having the authority to approve the action, commits to a plan to sell the long-lived assets to be sold. 

The long-lived assets to be sold are available for immediate sale in their present condition subject only to terms that are usual and customary for sales of such long-lived assets to be sold. 

An active program to locate a buyer or buyers and other actions required to complete the plan to sell the long-lived assets to be sold have been initiated. 

The sale of the long-lived assets to be sold is probable (the future event or events are likely to occur), and transfer of the long-lived assets to be sold is expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale, within one year, unless events or circumstances beyond an entity's control extend the period required to complete the sale as discussed below. 

The long-lived assets to be sold are being actively marketed for sale at a price that is reasonable in relation to its current fair value. 

Actions required to complete the plan indicate that it is unlikely that significant changes to the plan will be made or that the plan will be withdrawn.

Fair value at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 

Financial instruments measured at fair value are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The fair value of the convertible promissory notes at issuance and subsequent financial reporting dates was estimated based on significant inputs not observable in the market, which represent level 3 measurements within the fair value hierarchy. 
 The fair value of the convertible promissory notes at issuance and at each reporting period was estimated based on significant inputs not observable in the market, which represents a Level 3 measurement within the fair value hierarchy. The Company used a scenario-based binomial model to estimate the fair value of the convertible promissory notes. The model determines the fair value from a market participant's perspective by evaluating the payouts under hold, convert, or call decisions. The most significant estimates and assumptions used as inputs are those concerning type, timing and probability of specific scenario outcomes. Specifically, the Company assigned a probability of default, which would increase the required payout as described in Note 11 and calculated the fair value under each scenario. 
 At the issuance dates of the convertible promissory notes, the probability of default ("PD") was assumed to be (December 31, 2023- ), except for those Increasing (decreasing) the probability of default would result in a significantly higher (lower) fair value measurement. 
 Other significant unobservable inputs include the expected volatility and the credit spread. The expected volatility was based on the historical volatility over a look-back period that was consistent with the balance-remaining term of the instruments. A value of to (December 31, 2023- range of to was used for the expected volatility. The discount for lack of marketability was determined using a range of option pricing methodologies using the remaining restriction term corresponding to each instrument on the relevant valuation date. The credit spread was determined in reference to credit yields of companies with similar credit risk at the date of valuation. A premium of (December 31, 2023- was added to the credit spread as an instrument specific adjustment to reflect the Company's risk of default. A value of (December 31, 2023- was used for the credit spread.

On February 4, 2019, the Company registered its common stock, having a par value of .0001 per share, pursuant to Section 12(g) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act") and is effective pursuant to General Instruction A.(d). 
 SusGlobal Energy Corp. ("SusGlobal") was formed by articles of amalgamation on December 3, 2014, in the Province of Ontario, Canada and its executive office is in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, at 200 Davenport Road. Our telephone number is 416-223-8500. Our website address is www.susglobalenergy.com. Our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K are all available, free of charge, on our website as soon as practicable after we file the reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"). SusGlobal Energy Corp., a company in the start-up stages and Commandcredit Corp. ("Commandcredit"), an inactive Canadian public company, amalgamated to continue business under the name of SusGlobal Energy Corp. 
 On May 23, 2017, SusGlobal filed an Application for Authorization to continue in another Jurisdiction with the Ministry of Government Services in Ontario and a certificate of corporate domestication and certificate of incorporation with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware under which it changed its jurisdiction of incorporation from Ontario to the State of Delaware (the "Domestication"). In connection with the Domestication each of the currently issued and outstanding common shares were automatically converted on a one-for-one basis into common shares compliant with the laws of the state of Delaware (the "Shares"). As a result of the Domestication, pursuant to Section 388 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the "DGCL"), SusGlobal continued its existence under the DGCL as a corporation incorporated in the State of Delaware. The business, assets and liabilities of SusGlobal and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis, as well as its principal location and fiscal year, were the same immediately after the Domestication as they were immediately prior to the Domestication. SusGlobal filed a Registration Statement on Form S-4 to register the Shares and this registration statement was declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission on May 12, 2017. 
 SusGlobal is a renewables company focused on acquiring, developing and monetizing a global portfolio of proprietary technologies in the waste to energy and regenerative products application. 
 When the terms "the Company," "we," "us" or "our" are used in this document, those terms refer to SusGlobal Energy Corp., and its wholly owned subsidiaries, SusGlobal Energy Canada Corp., SusGlobal Energy Canada I Ltd., SusGlobal Energy Belleville Ltd., SusGlobal Energy Hamilton Ltd., and 1684567 Ontario Inc.

As the global amount of organic waste continues to grow, a solution for sustainable global management of these wastes is paramount. SusGlobal through its proprietary technology and processes is equipped and confident to deliver this objective. Management believes renewable energy is the energy of the future. Sources of this type of energy are more evenly distributed over the earth's surface than finite energy sources, making it an attractive alternative to petroleum-based energy. Biomass, one of the renewable resources, is derived from organic material such as forestry, food, plant and animal residuals. SusGlobal can therefore help you turn what many consider waste into precious energy and regenerative products. The portfolio will be comprised of three distinct types of technologies: (a) Process Source Separated Organics ("SSO") in anaerobic digesters to divert from landfills and recover biogas. This biogas can be converted to gaseous fuel for industrial processes, electricity to the grid or cleaned for compressed renewable gas. (b) Maximizing the capacity of existing infrastructure (anaerobic digesters) to allow processing of SSO to increase biogas yield. (c) and (c) process SSO and digestate to produce an organic compost or a pathogen free organic liquid fertilizer. The convertibility of organic material into valuable end products such as biogas, liquid biofuels, organic fertilizers and compost shows the utility of renewables. These products can be converted into electricity, fuels and marketed to agricultural operations that are looking for an increase in crop yields, soil amendment and environmentally-sound practices. This practice also diverts these materials from landfills and reduces Greenhouse Gas Emissions ("GHG") that result from landfilling organic wastes. The Company can provide peace of mind that the full lifecycle of organic material is achieved, global benefits are realized and stewardship for total sustainability is upheld. It is management's objective to grow SusGlobal into a significant sustainable waste to energy and regenerative products provider, as Leaders in The Circular Economy . 
 We believe the products and services offered can benefit both the public and private markets. The following includes some of our work managing organic waste streams: Anaerobic Digestion, Dry Digestion, Wastewater Treatment, In-Vessel Composting, SSO Treatment, Biosolids Heat Treatment, Leachate Management, Composting and Liquid Fertilizers. 
 The Company can provide a full range of services for handling organic residuals in a period where innovation and sustainability are paramount. From start to finish we offer in-depth knowledge, a wealth of experience and cutting-edge technology for handling organic waste. 
 The primary focus of the services SusGlobal provides includes integrating our technologies with capital investment to optimize the processing of SSO. Our processes not only divert significant organic waste from landfills, but also result in methane avoidance, with significant GHG reductions from waste disposal. The processes produce regenerative products through the conversion of organic wastes into organic fertilizer, both dry compost and liquid. 
 Currently, the primary customers are municipalities in both rural and urban centers in Ontario, Canada. Where necessary, to follow provincial and local environmental laws and regulations, SusGlobal submits applications to the respective authorities for approval prior to any necessary engineering being carried out. 
 We are a "smaller reporting company," as defined under SEC Regulation S-K. As such, we also are exempt from the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and are subject to less extensive disclosure requirements regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements. We will continue to be deemed a smaller reporting company until (i) our public float exceeds 250 million on the last day of our second fiscal quarter in our prior fiscal year (if our annual revenues exceeded 100 million in such prior fiscal year); or (ii) our public float exceeds 700 million on the last day of our second fiscal quarter in our prior fiscal year (if our annual revenues were less than 100 million in such prior fiscal year). 
 RECENT BUSINESS DEVELOPMENTS 
 On October 22, 2024, the Company generated revenue of 42,715 (C 57,660), from the sale of 16,000 carbon credits from its Belleville Facility. 
 On August 13, 2024, the lender's representative took possession of the Company's truck and hauling trailer due to outstanding monthly payments since February 7, 2024 and removed it from the Belleville Facility to be auctioned. 
 On July 28, 2024, the Company's real estate broker listed the Company's two properties located in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada, for sale. On the recommendation of the real estate broker, there was no selling price noted. 
 On July 29, 2024, the Company reached a settlement of a claim with Gillam for outstanding amounts owing on the construction of the Hamilton Facility. The Company provided Gillam with a 2nd mortgage secured by the property at 520 Nash Road North in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada in the amount of 2,222,400 (C 3,000,000), due February 1, 2025. If the mortgage is paid by November 30, 2024, the final payment will be reduced to 2,148,320 (C 2,900,000). If the payment is not made by November 30, 2024, interest will accrue commencing on December 1, 2024 based on the Bank of Nova Scotia prime rate plus 4 annually, calculated daily. In addition, together with the registration of this 2nd mortgage, Gillam will cause the motion for judgement in respect of the constructions liens scheduled for a hearing on July 30, 2024 to be adjourned until after the expiry date. On payment of the 2nd mortgage, Gillam will have the construction liens on the property noted above, discharged.

As noted below, the Belleville Facility ceased accepting waste after January 10, 2024 and continues to seek funding or re-financing to remediate the compliance matters in an effort to begin accepting waste again before the end of the current year or early in 2025. 
 On May 16, 2024, the Company was informed by its Canadian legal counsel that the City of Belleville, Ontario, Canada (the "City"), issued an order against the Belleville Facility, its numbered company, 1684567 and its officers for the repayment of the cost of pumping out contaminated water from the City's roadside ditch, along with legal and other associated costs. On May 31, 2024, the companies and the officers filed notices of appeal to the Ontario Land Tribunal. 
 On or around November 27, 2023 and March 6, 2024, the Company experienced an outflow of contaminated water from its stormwater pond at its Belleville Facility, which spilled over into the City of Belleville's roadside ditch and has continued to periodically overflow. The Company is collaborating with its environmental consultants and its Canadian legal counsel to assess the damage caused, remediate this occurrence and report regularly to the Ministry of the Environment, Conservation and Parks from the Province of Ontario (the "MECP"). 
 As a result of an order issued by the Ministry of Labour, Immigration, Training and Skills Development, specifically relating to high ammonia levels in one of the Company's composting buildings, the Company ceased accepting waste after January 10, 2024, to address this and other compliance matters issued by the MECP. The Company also received orders from the MECP to address repairs, the clean-up of unusable waste on site, re-habilitating its stormwater management system and other matters. Management anticipates these matters will take many months to complete, will require significant investment, and are dependent on the Company securing funding. We believe that our operating property, vehicle and equipment had been adequately maintained but will require significant investment to carry out repairs and improvements as ordered by the MECP. This will also include replacement of certain equipment at the Belleville Facility.

 (c) Other Financings 
 (i) As a result of the COVID-19 virus, the Government of Canada launched the Canada Emergency Business Account (the "CEBA"), a program to ensure that small businesses have access to the capital they need to see them through the current challenges and better position them to quickly return to providing services to their communities and creating employment. The program is administered by Canadian chartered banks and credit unions. 
 These CEBA loans were repaid on January 9, 2024 and January 11, 2024, in total 51,142 (C 70,000) and 22,242 (C 30,000) was forgiven as outlined in the CEBA term loan agreements.

The last payment made was on February 7, 2024. And, as noted above under recent business developments, on August 13, 2024, the lender's representative took possession of the truck and hauling trailer and removed it from the Belleville Facility to be auctioned. Final auction details of the sale have not been finalized. 
 For the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, 632 (C 862) and 1,718 (C 2,337) (2023- 823; C 1,103 and 2,794; C 3,760) respectively, in interest was incurred. 
 (d) Financings Related to Obligations Under Capital Lease 
 There was no new capital leases entered into by the Company during the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024. The original terms of the obligations under capital lease outstanding at September 30, 2024 are noted below. 
 (i) The lease agreement for certain equipment for the Belleville Facility at a cost of 288,653 (C 389,650), is payable in monthly blended installments of principal and interest of 5,076 (C 6,852), plus applicable harmonized sales taxes for a period of fifty-nine months plus an initial deposit of 14,409 (C 19,450) plus applicable harmonized sales taxes and an option to purchase the equipment for a final payment of a nominal amount of 74 (C 100) plus applicable harmonized sales taxes on February 27, 2025.

 For the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, 459 (C 626) and 1,611 (C 2,192) (2023- 785; C 1,053 and 2,768; C 3,725) respectively, in interest was incurred. 
 The Company is in arrears with payments to the lessor. The last payment made was on January 27, 2024. As a result, on May 24, 2024, the lessor repossessed the equipment. 
 Operations 
 The Company owns Environmental Compliance Approvals (the "ECAs") issued by the MECP from the Province of Ontario, in place to accept up to 70,000 metric tonnes ("MT") of waste annually from the provinces of Ontario, Quebec and from New York state, and to operate a waste transfer station with the capacity to process up to an additional 50,000 MT of waste annually. Once built, the location of the waste transfer station will be alongside the Organic and Non-Hazardous Waste Processing and Composting Facility which is currently operating in Belleville, Ontario, Canada. 
 Waste Transfer Station - Access to the waste transfer station is critical to haulers who collect waste in areas not in close proximity to disposal facilities where such disposal continues to be permitted. Tipping fees charged to third parties at waste transfer stations are usually based on the type and volume or weight of the waste deposited at the waste transfer station, the distance to the disposal site, market rates for disposal costs and other general market factors. 
 Organic Composting Facility - As noted above, the Company's Belleville Facility, located in Belleville, Ontario Canada, has ECAs in place to accept up to 70,000 MT of waste annually and is currently in operation. Certain assets of the organic waste processing and composting facility, including the ECAs for the waste transfer station (not yet built), were acquired by the Company on September 15, 2017, from the Receiver for Astoria, under the asset purchase agreement (the "APA"). The Company charges tipping fees for the waste accepted at the Belleville Facility based on arrangements in place with the customers and the type of waste accepted. Typical waste accepted includes, SSO, leaf and yard, food, liquid, paper sludge and biosolids. As the Company stopped receiving waste after January 10, 2024, there was no revenue to September 30, 2024. During the three-month period ended March 31, 2024, tipping fees ranged from 51 (C 69) to 117 (C 159) per MT. 

34 

The Company owns a 41,535 square foot facility (approximately 27 complete) on 5.29 acres in Hamilton, Ontario (the "Hamilton Facility"), which includes the additional land purchased November 2, 2023 and which includes an Environmental Compliance Approval to process 65,884 MT per annum of organic waste, 24 hours per day 7 days a week. The Hamilton Facility has been designed to produce, distribute and warehouse the Company's SusGro organic liquid fertilizer and other products that are anticipated to be provided under private label and to be sold through big box retailers, consumer lawn and garden suppliers, and for end use to the wine, cannabis and agriculture industries. With the addition of a further 11,000 square feet of office space and R D labs, the Hamilton Facility will also house the continued development of SusGlobal's proprietary formulations and branded liquid and dry organic fertilizers. 
 As noted above, under recent business developments, the Hamilton Facility was listed for sale on July 28, 2024. 
 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company had a bank balance of 53,518 (December 31, 2023- 1,263) and current debt obligations and other current liabilities in the amount of 33,164,982 (December 31, 2023- 30,823,963). As at September 30, 2024, the Company had a working capital deficit of 33,002,073 (December 31, 2023- 30,390,423). The Company does not currently have sufficient funds to satisfy the current debt obligations. 
 The Company's total assets as at September 30, 2024 were 11,026,789 (December 31, 2023- 11,755,903) and total current liabilities were 33,164,982 (December 31, 2023- 30,823,963). Significant losses from operations have been incurred since inception and there is an accumulated deficit of 42,218,458 as at September 30, 2024 (December 31, 2023 - 38,570,531). Continuation as a going concern is dependent upon generating significant new revenue and generating external capital and securing debt to satisfy its creditors' demands and to achieve profitable operations while maintaining current fixed expense levels. 
 To pay current liabilities and to fund any future operations, the Company requires significant new funds, which the Company may not be able to obtain. In addition to the funds required to liquidate the 33,164,982 in current debt obligations and other current liabilities, the Company estimates that approximately 10,000,000 must be raised to fund capital requirements and general corporate expenses for the next 12 months. 
 In the normal course of business, we are exposed to market risks, including changes in interest rates, certain commodity prices and Canadian currency rates. The Company does not use derivatives to manage these risks. 
 As at September 30, 2024, the current and long-term portions of our debt obligations totaled 22,003,136 (December 31, 2023- 20,447,318). As a result of default and cross defaults, the long-term debt is presented as current debt, even where due beyond twelve months of the balance sheet date. 
 In addition, up until September 30, 2023, PACE had provided the Company a letter of credit in favor of the MECP in the amount of 205,076 (C 276,831) and, as security, has registered a charge of lease over the Belleville Facility. 
 The current letter of credit required by the MEC is 472,361 (C 637,637) and now 8518 (C 146,487), while the Company re-assesses and re-submits it financial assurance to the MECP with the assistance of its environmental consultant. The Company has not yet satisfied this requirement of the MECP. 
 The letter of credit is a requirement of the MECP and is in connection with the financial assurance provided by the Company for it to be in compliance with the MECPs environmental objectives. The MECP regularly evaluates the Belleville Facility to ensure compliance is adhered to and the letter of credit is subject to change by the MECP. The Company has engaged an environmental consulting firm to re-evaluate the financial assurance with the MECP, which is based on the estimated environmental remediation and clean-up costs for its waste processing and composting facility. As a result of inspections carried out by the MECP during the prior years, some of which have resulted in MECP orders having been issued, the Company has accrued estimated and actual costs for certain corrective measures in orders issued by the MECP and other costs in the amount of 2,220,235 (C 2,997,077) (December 31, 2023- 2,153,214; C 2,847,790).

As a result of an order issued by the Ministry of Labour, Immigration, Training and Skills Development, specifically relating to high ammonia levels in one of the Company's composting buildings at its Belleville Facility, the Company ceased accepting waste after January 10, 2024, to address this and other compliance matters issued by the MECP. The Company also received orders from the MECP to address repairs, the clean-up of unusable waste on site, re-habilitating its stormwater management system and other matters. Management anticipates these matters will take the balance of the year and into early 2025 to be completed and be able to reopen. This will require significant investment, and is dependent on the Company securing funding, with a focus on equity financing. We believe that our operating property, vehicle and equipment had been adequately maintained but will require significant investment to carry out repairs and improvements, some of which as ordered by the MECP. This will also include replacement of certain equipment at the Belleville Facility. 

36 

During the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, the Company did not generate any revenue from its Belleville Facility compared to 186,901 in the three-month period ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in revenue is due to the result of not accepting waste after January 10, 2024. 
 In the typical operation of the Belleville Facility, the Company processes organic and other waste received and produces the end product, compost. The cost of sales totaled 271,696 for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 compared to 193,120 for the three-month period ended September 30, 2023. These costs include equipment rental, delivery, fuel, repairs and maintenance, direct wages and benefits, depreciation and utilities. These costs include estimates for completing certain known compliance matters as ordered by the MECP. 
 Operating expenses decreased by 429,302 from 1,070,180 in the three-month period ended September 30, 2023 to 640,878 in the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, explained further below. 
 Management compensation related to stock-based compensation reduced by 3,600, in the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three-month period ended September 30, 2023. The current stock-based compensation reflects the stock-based compensation issued to the CEO as stipulated in his executive consulting contract, effective January 1, 2023. This will be earned through the balance of the current year, in the amount of 54,000. And the management compensation relating to fees increased by 20,055 reflecting the increase in the CEO's compensation for the current year. 
 Marketing expenses reduced by 923, from 923 in the three-month period ended September 30, 2023 to nil for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, as the Company did not have a marketing campaign during the current period. 
 Professional fees increased by 60,993, from 103,930 in the three-month period ended September 30, 2023 to 164,923 in the three-month period ended September 30, 2024. The primary reason for the increase is due to the legal and consulting fees incurred in addressing the orders issued by the MECP. 
 Interest expense increased by 151,825 from 140,161 in the three-month period ended September 30, 2023 to 291,986 in the three-month period ended September 30, 2024. This increase was primarily due to the increase in mortgages in December of 2023, new mortgages on the Hamilton, Ontario, Canada property purchase in November of 2023, a new 4th mortgage on the Belleville Facility and new loans from Haute Inc., in December 2023 and January 2024. These changes along with the new fixed rates on certain mortgages at 12 and 13 annually resulted in an increased interest expense. 
 Office and administration expenses increased nominally by 761 from 56,567 in the three-month period ended September 30, 2023 to 57,328 in the three-month period ended September 30, 2024. 
 Rent and occupancy decreased nominally by 2,642 from 58,385 in the three-month period ended September 30, 2023 to 55,743 in the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to a decrease related expenses for the Company's Toronto, Ontario, Canada office and additional property taxes on the additional land purchased in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada. 
 Insurance decreased by 23,911 from 10,974 in the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 to a credit of 2,021 in the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, as certain insurance coverage expired during the period. The Company continues to not have the funds to pay for current or certain past insurance premiums. 
 Filing fees decreased by 2,426, from 8,562 in the three-month period ended September 30, 2023 to 6,136 in the three-month period ended September 30, 2024. 
 The amortization of financing costs increased by 28,817, from 26,901 in the three-month period ended September 30, 2023 to 42,663 in the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, due to new financing fees incurred on the new or re-financed mortgages in the fourth quarter of 2023, the new loans from Haute Inc., in the fourth quarter of 2023 and in January of 2024, along with the new 4th mortgage on the Belleville Facility in April of 2024. 
 Directors' compensation decreased nominally by 303 from 18,631 in the three-month period ended September 30, 2023 to 18,328 in the three-month period ended September 30, 2024. The decrease is entirely related to the foreign exchange translation applied in the current quarter versus the prior year's quarter. 

37 

There was no stock-based compensation in the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, a reduction of 254,724 from the three-month period ended September 30, 2023 as a result of no services provided by consultants who were compensated through the issuance of the Company's common stock. 
 Repairs and maintenance increased by 6,320 from 1,105 in the three-month period ended September 30, 2023 to 7,335 in the three-month period ended September 30, 2024. The increase is primarily related to certain additional repair costs accrued in the Belleville Facility. 
 The foreign exchange loss in the three-month period ended September 30, 2023 in the amount of 214,406 reduced to an income amount of 192,999 in the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 a change of 407,405, due primarily to the translation of significant United States dollar denominated transactions and balances during the current period including the convertible promissory notes, during a period of a strengthening Canadian dollar compared to the United States dollar. In the three-month period ended September 30, 2023, the Canadian dollar had weakened compared to the United States dollar. 
 During the current three-month period ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded a loss on the revaluation of the convertible promissory notes in the amount of 152,239 compared to loss of 116,710 in the three-month period ended September 30, 2023. Further, as a result of a default judgement filed by the March 2022 Investor for their March 2022 Investor Note in September 2024, certain actions were dropped which were previously accrued for and additional interest charges were added. The impact of the removal of the two causes of action totaling 2,250,000, plus the additional pre-judgement and other interest charged resulted in a reduction in the previous accrual for loss in the amount of 1,321,733. In total, other income (expense) changed by 1,286,204, from an expense of 116,710 in the three-month period ended September 30, 2023 to income of 1,169,494 in the three-month period ended September 30, 2024.

As a result of an order issued by the Ministry of Labour, Immigration, Training and Skills Development, specifically relating to high ammonia levels in one of the Company's composting buildings at its Belleville Facility, the Company ceased accepting waste after January 10, 2024, to address this and other compliance matters issued by the MECP. The Company also received orders from the MECP to address repairs, the clean-up of unusable waste on site, re-habilitating its stormwater management system and other matters. Management anticipates these matters will take the balance of the year and into early 2025 to be completed and be able to reopen. This will require significant investment, and is dependent on the Company securing funding, with a focus on equity financing. We believe that our operating property, vehicle and equipment had been adequately maintained but will require significant investment to carry out repairs and improvements, some of which as ordered by the MECP. This will also include replacement of certain equipment at the Belleville Facility. 
 During the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, the Company generated total revenue of 38,575 from its Belleville Facility compared to 505,075 in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in revenue is primarily due to the result of not accepting waste after January 10, 2024. Revenue in the current period includes 16,468 from the sale of carbon credits compared to 60,449 in the prior period. 
 In the typical operation of the Belleville Facility, the Company processes organic and other waste received and produces the end product, compost. The cost of sales totaled 768,939 for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 compared to 574,404 for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023. These costs include equipment rental, delivery, fuel, repairs and maintenance, direct wages and benefits, depreciation, utilities and outside contractors. These costs include estimates for completing certain known compliance matters as ordered by the MECP. 
 Operating expenses increased by 295,106 from 2,734,526 in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023 to 3,029,632 in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, explained further below. 
 Management compensation related to stock-based compensation reduced by 10,800, in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023. The current stock-based compensation reflects the stock-based compensation issued to the CEO as stipulated in his executive consulting contract, effective January 1, 2023. This will be earned throughout the current year in the amount of 54,000. And the management compensation relating to fees increased by 62,332, reflecting the increase in the CEO's compensation for the current year. 
 Marketing expenses reduced by 121,597, from 122,098 in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023 to 501 for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, as the Company did not have a marketing campaign during the current period. 
 Professional fees increased by 298,878, from 286,723 in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023 to 585,601 in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024. The primary reason for the increase is due to additional legal and consulting fees incurred in addressing the orders issued by the MECP and the City of Belleville. 
 Interest expense increased by 383,083 from 499,222 in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023 to 882,305 in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024. This increase was primarily due to the increase in mortgages in December of 2023, new mortgages on the Hamilton, Ontario, Canada property purchase in November of 2023, a new 4th mortgage on the Belleville Facility and new loans from Haute Inc., in December 2023 and January 2024. These changes along with the new fixed rates on certain mortgages at 12 and 13 annually resulted in an increased interest expense. This was offset by the settlement of the PACE loans in November 2023, resulting in no interest incurred in the current nine-month period ending September 30, 2024 compared to the interest incurred in the previous nine-month period ended September 30, 2023 of 103,371. 

39 

Office and administration expenses increased by 48,729, from 176,120 in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023 to 224,849 in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, primarily from interest and penalties charged on overdue balances. 
 Rent and occupancy increased by 16,441 from 161,127 in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023 to 177,568 in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to an increase in rent and related expenses for the Company's Toronto, Ontario, Canada office and additional property taxes on the additional land purchased in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada in November of 2023. 
 Insurance increased by 12,022 from 33,167 in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, to 45,189 in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, as the Company continues to accrue for certain coverage which it has not been able to fund. 
 Filing fees decreased by 4,539 from 31,852 in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023 to 27,313 in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024. 
 The amortization of financing costs increased by 83,271, from 72,296 in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023 to 155,567 in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, due to new financing fees incurred on the new or re-financed mortgages in the fourth quarter of 2023, the new loans from Haute Inc., in the fourth quarter of 2023 and January of 2024, along with the new 4th mortgage on the Belleville Facility in the current quarter. 
 Directors' compensation increased nominally by 1,922 from 53,211 in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023 to 55,133 in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024. This was primarily the result of the timing of the new independent director who had not joined the board until mid-way through the first quarter of 2023. 
 There was no stock-based compensation in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, a reduction of 785,149 from the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023 as a result of no services provided by consultants who were compensated through the issuance of the Company's common stock. 
 Repairs and maintenance decreased nominally by 3,563 from 22,636 in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023 to 19,073 in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024. The decrease is primarily related to a reduction in repairs accrued in the Belleville Facility. 
 The foreign exchange income in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023 in the amount of 33,037 reduced to a loss of 281,039 in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, a change of 314,076, due primarily to the translation of significant United States dollar denominated transactions and balances during the current period including the convertible promissory notes, compared to the prior period, during a period of a weakening Canadian dollar compared to the United States dollar. In the prior nine-month period ended September 30, 2023, the Canadian dollar had strengthened compared to the United States dollar. 
 During the current nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded a loss on the revaluation of the convertible promissory notes in the amount of 1,004,361 compared to loss of 2,296,845 in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023. In addition, during the current nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, the Company recognized a loss of 227,545 on a provision for loss on settlement of the claim from the general contractor for the construction for the Hamilton Facility. In addition, during the current nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, the Company recognized a gain of 22,242 on the forgiveness of a portion of the CEBA loans on repayment in January of 2024. Further, as a result of a default judgement filed by the March 2022 Investor in September 2024 for their March 2022 Investor Note, certain actions were dropped which were previously accrued for and additional interest charges were added. The impact of the removal of the two causes of action totaling 2,250,000, plus the additional pre-judgement and other interest charged resulted in a reduction in the previous accrual for income in the amount of 1,321,733. And, in the prior nine-month period ended September 30, 2023 the Company incurred a loss of 74,359, on the conversions of a portion of a convertible promissory note. In total, other (expense) income decreased by 2,483,273 from an expense of 2,371,204 in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023 to income of 112,069 in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024. 
 As at September 30, 2024, the Company had a working capital deficit of 33,002,073 (December 31, 2023- 30,390,423), incurred a net loss of 3,647,927 (September 30, 2023- 5,175,059) for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and had an accumulated deficit of 42,218,458 (December 31, 2023- 38,570,531) and expects to incur further losses in the development of its business. 
 These factors cast substantial doubt as to the Company's ability to continue as a going concern, which is dependent upon its ability to obtain the necessary financing to further the development of its business and satisfy its outstanding obligations to its creditors and upon achieving profitable operations. There is no assurance of funding being available or available on acceptable terms. Realization values may be substantially different from carrying values as shown.

The interim condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result if the Company was unable to continue as a going concern. 
 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES 
 Use of estimates 
 The preparation of the Company's consolidated financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. These estimates are based on management's best knowledge of current events and actions the Company may undertake in the future. The Company regularly evaluates estimates and assumptions. The Company bases its estimates and assumptions on current facts, historical experience and various other factors that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgements about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the accrual of costs and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Areas involving significant estimates and assumptions include: the allowance for doubtful accounts, inventory valuation, useful lives of long-lived and intangible assets, impairment of long-lived assets and intangible assets, valuation of asset acquisition, accruals, fair value of convertible promissory notes, deferred income tax assets and related valuation allowance, environmental remediation costs, stock-based compensation and going concern. Actual results could differ from these estimates. These estimates are reviewed periodically and as adjustments become necessary, they are reported in earnings in the period in which they become available. 
 Stock-based compensation 
 The Company records compensation costs related to stock-based awards in accordance with ASC 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation, whereby the Company measures stock-based compensation cost at the grant date based on the estimated fair value of the award. Compensation cost is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the award. Where necessary, the Company utilizes the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to estimate the fair value of stock options granted, which requires the input of highly subjective assumptions including: the expected option life, the risk-free rate, the dividend yield, the volatility of the Company's stock price and an assumption for employee forfeitures. The risk-free rate is based on the U.S. Treasury bill rate at the date of the grant with maturity dates approximately equal to the expected term of the option. The Company has not historically issued any dividends and does not expect to in the near future. Changes in any of these subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimates and the resulting stock-based compensation recognized. The Company has not issued any stock options and has no stock options outstanding at September 30, 2024. 
 Indefinite Asset Impairments 
 The Company evaluates the intangible assets for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or when triggering events are identified and whether events and circumstances continue to support the indefinite useful life using Level 3 inputs. 
 Long-Lived Asset Impairments 
 In accordance with ASC 360, "Property, Plant and Equipment", long-lived assets to be held and used are analyzed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable. 
 The Company evaluates at each balance sheet date whether events or circumstances have occurred that indicate possible impairment. If there are indications of impairment, the Company uses future undiscounted cash flows of the related asset or asset grouping over the remaining life in measuring whether the carrying amounts are recoverable. In the event that such cash flows are not expected to be sufficient to recover the recorded asset values, the assets are written down to their estimated fair value. 
 Convertible Promissory Notes 
 The Company has elected the fair value option to account for its convertible promissory notes issued after December 31, 2020. In accordance with ASC 825, the convertible promissory notes are marked-to-market at each reporting date with changes in fair value recorded as a component of other income (expense), in the interim condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. The Company has elected to include interest expense in the changes in fair value. Transaction costs are expenses as incurred. The Company did not elect the fair value option for the convertible promissory notes issued in 2019. These notes are measured at amortized cost.

 For the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, the Company incurred 109,965 (C 150,000) and 330,795 (C 450,000) (2023- 89,449; C 120,000 and 267,552; C 360,000) respectively, in management fees expense with Travellers International Inc.

 For the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, the Company incurred 33,315 (C 44,661) and 92,449 (C 125,764) (2023- 30,014; C 40,046 and 80,452; C 108,251) respectively, in rent expense paid under a lease agreement with Haute Inc.

There was no gain or loss on these conversions. Further, on September 30, 2024, 6,000,000 common shares of the Company were issued to Travellers on a private placement at a price per share of 0.02. 
 For the independent directors, the Company recorded directors' compensation during the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 of 18,328 (C 25,000) and 55,133 (C 75,000) (2023- 18,631; C 25,000 and 53,211; C 71,597) respectively. In addition, in the prior year, on February 18, 2023, a new independent director was appointed and he was awarded 100,000 common shares of the Company on March 1, 2023 valued at 21,000 based on the closing trading price on the appointed date and included under stock-based compensation in the interim condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. As at September 30, 2024, outstanding directors' compensation of 248,756 (C 335,793) (December 31, 2023- 197,186; C 260,793) is included in accrued liabilities in the interim condensed consolidated balance sheets. 
 Pursuant to the terms of the CEO's Consulting Agreement, for his services as the CEO, the compensation is at a rate of 29,576 (C 40,000) per month for twelve (12) months, beginning on the Effective Date, January 1, 2023, and at a rate of 36,970 (C 50,000) per month for twelve (12) months, beginning January 1, 2024. In addition, the Company agreed to grant the CEO 3,000,000 restricted shares of the Company's Common Stock, par value of 0.0001 per share (the "Common Stock") on the Effective Date. The Company has also agreed to reimburse the CEO for certain out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the CEO. 
 Pursuant to the terms of the CFO's Consulting Agreement for his services as the CFO, the compensation is at a rate of 9,243 (C 12,500) per month for twelve (12) months, beginning on the Effective Date, January 1, 2023. In addition, the Company agreed to grant the CFO 100,000 restricted shares of the Company's Common Stock, par value of 0.0001 per share (the "Common Stock") on the Effective Date. The Company has also agreed to reimburse the CFO for certain out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the CFO. The CFO currently provides his services on a month-to-month basis. 

42 

Furthermore, for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, the Company recognized management stock-based compensation expense of 54,000 and 162,000 (2023- 57,600 and 172,800) respectively, on the common stock issued to the CEO and the CFO, 3,000,000 and 100,000 common stock, respectively, as stipulated in their executive consulting agreements, effective January 1, 2023 valued at the trading price on the Effective Date.

The portion to be expensed for the balance of the consulting agreements, 54,000 (2023- 273,600) is included in prepaid expenses and deposits in the interim condensed consolidated balance sheets. 
 OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS 
 We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources that are material to investors. 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk . 
 As a smaller reporting company, as that term is defined in Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K, we are not required to provide the information required by this Item. 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Our management, with the participation of our CEO and CFO, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act") as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of our disclosure control system are met. Due to inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues, if any, within a company have been detected. Based on our evaluation, our CEO and CFO have concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective. The matters involving internal controls over financial reporting that may be considered material weaknesses included the small size of the Company and the resulting lack of a segregation of duties. 
 Notwithstanding these material weaknesses, management has concluded that the unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position, results of operations and cash flows in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 During the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, there were no changes made by management to its internal controls over financial reporting. 
 PART II: OTHER INFORMATION 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings. 
 From time to time, the Company may become involved in litigation relating to claims arising from the ordinary course of business. Management believes that there are currently no claims or actions pending against us, the ultimate disposition of which would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows, except as follows: 

43 

The Company has a claim against it for unpaid legal fees in the amount of 48,331 (C 65,241). The amount is included in accounts payable on the Company's consolidated balance sheet. 
 On October 4, 2023, an action was launched by one of the October 2021 Investors, who claimed he was owed 1,300,000 plus accrued interest. The principal balance in the accounts and noted under convertible promissory notes, note 11(a) in the interim condensed consolidated financial statements is 1,800,485 (December 31, 2023- 1,645,337), which is after conversions of 318,100 during 2022 and 2023 and includes accrued interest of 500,485 (December 31, 2023- 345,337). The Company has disclosed the fair value of this convertible promissory note as 2,683,862 (December 31, 2023- 2,404,558). The Company intends to repay the balance owed when it is financially able to do so. 
 On November 27, 2023 and March 6, 2024, the Company experienced an outflow of leachate impacted water from its stormwater pond into the City of Belleville's (the "City") roadside ditch. The Company is collaborating with its environmental consultants and its Canadian legal counsel to assess the damage caused, remediate this occurrence and report regularly to the MECP. As noted below, on August 30, 2024, the Company and the City remediated with a settlement in the amount of 96,304 (C 130,000) 
 The Company has a claim against it for unpaid hydro bills in the amount of 370,623 (C 500,302). The amount of this original claim and any amounts subsequently to September 30, 2024 are included in accounts payable and in accrued liabilities on the Company's interim condensed consolidated balance sheets. 
 In addition, on November 17, 2023, the Company received an amended claim filed against it from 2023 by Tradigital in the sum of 219,834 in owed fees plus the difference in stock price, 300,000 common shares of the Company, plus attorney fees and expenses. The case went to arbitration on March 11, 2024 and the Company defended its position. On April 4, 2024, the International Centre for Dispute Resolution indicated that no additional evidence is to be submitted, and the hearings were declared closed as of April 29, 2024. The tribunal endeavored to render the final decision within the timeframe provided for in the rules. Management agrees that outstanding fees, which are included in accounts payable in the interim condensed consolidated balance sheets, are only in the amount of 30,000, which was agreed to by the parties in earlier communications and through various e-mail correspondence. In addition, management has no issue with the outstanding common shares to be provided to the claimant totaling 300,000. Management believes that the additional claim amount of 189,834 is without merit. Of the total of 300,000 common shares, 50,000 have been issued and the remaining 250,000 were previously disclosed as shares to be issued in the consolidated statements of stockholders' deficiency. On April 26, 2024, the arbitrator for this claim awarded Tradigital the sum of 118,170 which had been accrued by the Company as at December 31, 2023 and subsequently through September 30, 2024 and the remaining 250,000 common shares were not required to be issued by the Company. 
 On April 1, 2024, the Company received notice of a complaint filed against it by one of the March 2022 Investors, seeking damages of no less than 4,545,393. The Company had thirty calendar days to respond and on April 30, 2024, the Company was able to extend the time to respond with opposing counsel, a further fifteen days. The Company has been unable to retain counsel to represent it in this matter. The full amount of the complaint was included in the accounts at December 31, 2023, March 31, 2024 and June 30, 2024. On May 21, 2024, the counsel for the plaintiff requested an entry for a default judgement against the Company. On September 11, 2024, the default judgement was filed in the amount of 2,848,744. In addition, pre-judgement interest was granted in the amount of 87,414 at the rate of 10 per annum on the principal balance from May 22, 2024 through September 11, 2024. On the filing of this default judgement, the March 2022 Investor removed two causes of action previously filed in their complaint which the Company received notice of on April 1, 2024 and accrued for accordingly. The impact of the removal of the two causes of action totaling 2,250,000, plus the additional pre-judgement and other interest charged resulted in a reduction in the previous accrual for loss in the amount of 1,321,733. This adjustment to the provision for loss is disclosed under other income (expense), note 16(d), in the notes to the interim condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 On May 16, 2024, the Company was informed by its Canadian legal counsel that the City issued an order against the Belleville Facility, its numbered company, 1684567 and its officers for the repayment of the cost of pumping out contaminated water from the City's roadside ditch, along with legal and other associated costs. On May 31, 2024, the companies and the officers filed notices of appeal to the Ontario Land Tribunal. The Company and its Canadian legal counsel were in discussions with the legal representatives from the City, to come to a resolution before any action by the Ontario Land Tribunal. On August 30, 2024, minutes of settlement were finalized between the City and the Company to settle for an amount of 96,304 (C 130,000) ten days following the sale of the Hamilton Facility. There are certain events of default, including not meeting the timeline set above and if the sale of the Hamilton Facility does not occur before January 31, 2025, it would result in the actual cost incurred by the City to be paid by the Company. The actual costs noted in the minutes of settlement totaled 142,597 (C 192,490). In addition, in connection with the minutes of settlement, the Company and its officers subsequently withdrew their appeals with the Ontario Land Tribunal on September 4, 2024, and the Ontario Land Tribunal closed their case.

The settlement reached was over and above the original amount included in the accounts of the Company. The Company has provided for this excess in the amount of 227,545 (C 309,122) as a loss on settlement.
