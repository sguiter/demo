Alcoa Australia Holdings Pty Ltd (AAH), a wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of Alcoa, made an election prior to July 31, 2024 that resulted in Alcoa s other wholly-owned Australian subsidiaries joining AAH s tax consolidated group (the AAH Tax Consolidated Group). As a result of the acquisition of Alumina Limited, Alumina Limited and all of its Australian subsidiaries, as well as AofA and all of its subsidiaries, joined the AAH Tax Consolidated Group on August 1, 2024. Upon acquisition, Alcoa recognized a deferred tax asset (and a corresponding increase to Additional capital) of primarily related to the portion of Alumina Limited s Australian net operating loss carryforwards that the Company has determined are more likely than not to be realized as a result of the consolidated return election. The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA) contains a number of tax credits and other incentives for investments in renewable energy production, carbon capture, and other climate-related actions, as well as the production of critical minerals. In December 2023, the U.S. Treasury issued guidance on Section 45X of the Advanced Manufacturing Tax Credit. The Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (the Proposed Regulations) clarified that commercial grade aluminum could qualify for the credit, which was designed to incentivize domestic production of critical materials important for the global transition to renewable energy. In the third quarter and nine-month period of 2024 , the Company recorded benefits of and in Cost of goods sold, respectively, related to its Massena West smelter (New York) and its Warrick smelter (Indiana). As of September 30, 2024 , benefits of were included in Other receivables and were included in Other noncurrent assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. As of December 31, 2023, benefits of were included in Other receivables on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. On October 24, 2024, the U.S. Treasury finalized the Proposed Regulations under Section 45X with important modifications including the ability to include the cost of certain direct and indirect materials in the cost base of the credit. The Proposed Regulation on the definition of aluminum was not finalized; the U.S. Treasury has indicated it will finalize the definition at a later date. Alcoa is currently evaluating the impacts to the Company s results of operations.

and , respectively. In management s judgment, the Company s reserves are sufficient to satisfy the provisions of the respective action plans. Upon changes in facts or circumstances, a change to the reserve may be required. The Company s significant sites include: Suriname The reserve associated with the 2017 closure of the Suralco refinery and bauxite mine is for treatment and disposal of refinery waste and soil remediation. The work began in 2017 and is expected to be completed at the end of 2029. Hurricane Creek, Arkansas The reserve associated with the 1990 closure of two mining areas and refineries near Hurricane Creek, Arkansas is for ongoing monitoring and maintenance for water quality surrounding the mine areas and residue disposal areas. Massena, New York The reserve associated with the 2015 closure of the Massena East smelter by the Company s subsidiary, Reynolds Metals Company, is for subsurface soil remediation to be performed after demolition of the structures. Remediation work commenced in 2021 and will take four to to complete. Point Comfort, Texas The reserve associated with the 2019 closure of the Point Comfort alumina refinery is for disposal of industrial wastes contained at the site, subsurface remediation, and post-closure monitoring and maintenance. While it was determined that certain site remediation was no longer required in the third quarter of 2024, the final remediation plan is currently being developed and may result in a change to the existing reserve. Sherwin, Texas In connection with the 2018 settlement of a dispute related to the previously-owned Sherwin alumina refinery, the Company s subsidiary, Copano Enterprises LLC, accepted responsibility for the final closure of four bauxite residue waste disposal areas (known as the Copano facility). Work commenced on the first residue disposal area in 2018 and is expected to be completed no later than May 2028. Other than ongoing maintenance and repair activities, work on the next three areas has not commenced but is expected to be completed by 2048, depending on its potential re-use. Longview, Washington In connection with a 2018 Consent Decree and Cleanup Action Plan with the State of Washington Department of Ecology, the Company s subsidiary, Northwest Alloys as landowner, accepted certain responsibilities for future remediation of contaminated soil and sediments at the site located near Longview, Washington. In December 2020, the lessee of the land, who was a partner in the remediation of the site, filed for bankruptcy and exited the site in January 2021. The full site remediation project design, including long-term and post-closure monitoring and maintenance at the site, was approved in March 2023. In the third quarter of 2023, changes in scope and cost increases for remediation resulted in an increase to the reserve. The project is planned to be completed by the end of 2026. Addy, Washington The reserve associated with the 2022 closure of the Addy magnesium smelter facility is for site-wide remediation and investigation and post-closure monitoring and maintenance. Remediation work is not expected to begin until 2026 and will take three to to complete. The final remediation plan is currently being developed, which may result in a change to the existing reserve. Ferndale, Washington The reserve associated with the 2023 closure of the Intalco aluminum smelter in Ferndale, Washington is for below grade site remediation and of post-closure maintenance and monitoring. The final remediation plan is under review. In May 2022, the Company received a Notice of Violation (NOV) from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the EPA). The NOV alleges violations under the Clean Air Act at the Company s Intalco smelter from when the smelter was operational. The EPA referred the matter to the U.S. Department of Justice, Environment and Natural Resources Division (the DOJ) in May 2022. The DOJ and the Company agreed to a stipulated settlement, which was filed with the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington at Seattle on July 18, 2024, requiring the Company to pay a civil fine of . An accrual for this matter was included within Other current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of September 30, 2024. On October 15, 2024, the Court approved the stipulated settlement of , and payment has been remitted by the Company. Other Sites The Company is in the process of decommissioning various other plants and remediating sites in several countries for potential redevelopment or to return the land to a natural state. In aggregate, there are rem ediation projects at other sites that are planned or underway. These activities will be completed at various times in the next three to five years, after which ongoing monitoring and other activities may be required. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , the reserve balance associated with these activities was and , respectively.

(R from the Brazilian Federal Revenue Office (RFB) and received (R that year. In March 2013, AWAB was notified by the RFB that approxi mately (R of value added tax credits previously claimed were being disallowed and a penalty of was assessed. (R of the cash received in 2012 related to the disallowed amount. The value added tax credits were claimed by AWAB for both fixed assets and export sales related to the Juruti bauxite mine and Alumar refinery expansion for tax years 2009 through 2011. The RFB has disallowed credits they allege belong to the consortium in which AWAB owns an interest and should not have been claimed by AWAB. Credits have also been disallowed as a result of challenges to apportionment methods used, questions about the use of the credits, and an alleged lack of documented proof. AWAB presented defense of its claim to the RFB on April 8, 2013. In February 2022, the RFB notified AWAB that it had inspected the value added tax credits claimed for 2012 and disallowed (R ). In its decision, the RFB allowed credits of (R that were similar to those previously disallowed for 2009 through 2011. In July 2022, the RFB notified AWAB that it had inspected the value added tax credits claimed for 2013 and disallowed (R ). In its decision, the RFB allowed credits of (R that were similar to those previously disallowed for 2009 through 2011. AWAB received the 2012 allowed credits with interest of (R in March 2022 and the 2013 allowed credits with interest of (R in August 2022. The decisions on the 2012 and 2013 credits provide positive evidence to support management s opinion that there is no basis for these credits to be disallowed. AWAB will continue to dispute the credits that were disallowed for 2012 and 2013. If AWAB is successful in this administrative process, the RFB would have no further recourse. If unsuccessful in this process, AWAB has the option to litigate at a judicial level. Separately from AWAB s administrative appeal, in June 2015, a new tax law was enacted repealing the provisions in the tax code that were the basis for the RFB assessing a penalty in this matter. As such, the estimated range of reasonably possible loss for these matters is to (R ). It is management s opinion that the allegations have no basis; however, at this time, the Company is unable to reasonably predict an outcome for this matter. Australia (AofA) In December 2019, AofA received a statement of audit position (SOAP) from the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) related to the pricing of certain historic third-party alumina sales. The SOAP proposed adjustments that would result in additional income tax payable by AofA. During 2020, the SOAP was the subject of an independent review process within the ATO. At the conclusion of this process, the ATO determined to continue with the proposed adjustments and issued Notices of Assessment (the Notices) that were received by AofA on July 7, 2020. The Notices asserted claims for income tax payable by AofA of approximately (A ). The Notices also included claims for compounded interest on the tax amount totaling approximately (A ). On September 17, 2020, the ATO issued a position paper with its preliminary view on the imposition of administrative penalties related to the tax assessment issued to AofA. This paper proposed penalties of approximately (A ). AofA disagreed with the Notices and with the ATO s proposed position on penalties. During 2020, AofA lodged formal objections to the Notices, provided a submission on the ATO s imposition of interest and submitted a response to the ATO s position paper on penalties. After the ATO completes its review of AofA s response to the penalties position paper, the ATO could issue a penalty assessment. To date, AofA has not received a response to its submission on the ATO s imposition of interest or its response to the ATO s position paper on penalties. Through February 1, 2022, AofA did not receive a response from the ATO on AofA s formal objections to the Notices and, on that date, AofA submitted statutory notices to the ATO requiring the ATO to make decisions on AofA s objections within a 60-day period. On April 1, 2022, the ATO issued its decision disallowing the Company s objections related to the income tax assessment, while the position on penalties and interest remains outstanding. On April 29, 2022, AofA filed proceedings in the Australian Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT) against the ATO to contest the Notices. The AAT held the first directions hearing on July 25, 2022 ordering AofA to file its evidence and related materials by November 4, 2022, ATO to file its materials by April 14, 2023 and AofA to file reply materials by May 26, 2023. AofA filed its evidence and related materials on November 4, 2022. The ATO did not file its materials by April 14, 2023. At a directions hearing on May 17, 2023, the ATO was granted an extension to file its materials by August 18, 2023. At a directions hearing on September 26, 2023, the ATO was granted an additional extension to file its materials by November 3, 2023. The ATO filed its materials on November 13, 2023. At a directions hearing on November 22, 2023, AofA was ordered to file any reply materials by March 15, 2024. AofA filed its reply materials on March 15, 2024. The substantive hearing was completed in June 2024, and AofA is awaiting the AAT s decision. The Company maintains that the sales subject to the ATO s review, which were ultimately sold to Aluminium Bahrain B.S.C., were the result of arm s length transactions by AofA over two decades and were made at arm s length prices consistent with the prices paid by other third-party alumina customers.

of the assessed income tax amount exclusive of interest and any penalties, or approximately (A ), during the third quarter 2020, and the ATO is not expected to seek further payment prior to final resolution of the matter. If AofA is ultimately successful, any amounts paid to the ATO as part of the payment would be refunded. AofA funded the payment with cash on hand and recorded the payment within Other noncurrent assets as a noncurrent prepaid tax asset; at September 30, 2024 the related balance was (A ). Interest on the unpaid tax continues to accrue during the dispute, which, along with the initial interest assessment, is deductible against taxable income by AofA. Beginning in the third quarter of 2020, AofA applied this deduction and total reductions in cash tax payments of (A and (A are reflected within Other noncurrent liabilities and deferred credits as a noncurrent accrued tax liability at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. If AofA is ultimately successful, the interest would be taxable as income in the year the dispute is resolved, and accrued cash taxes would be paid to the ATO (A accrued as of September 30, 2024). The Company continues to believe it is more likely than not that AofA s tax position will be sustained and therefore is not recognizing any tax expense in relation to this matter. However, because the ultimate resolution of this matter is uncertain at this time, the Company cannot predict the potential loss or range of loss associated with the outcome, which may materially affect its results of operations and financial condition. References to any assessed U.S. dollar amounts presented in connection with this matter have been converted into U.S. dollars from Australian dollars based on the exchange rate in the respective period. Legal Proceedings St. Croix Proceedings Prior to 2012, Alcoa Inc., the Company s former parent company, was served with two multi-plaintiff actions alleging personal injury or property damage from Hurricane Georges or winds blowing material from the Company s former St. Croix alumina facility. These actions were subsequently consolidated into the Red Dust Claims docket in 2017. In March 2022, the Superior Court of the Virgin Islands issued an amended case management order dividing complaints filed in the Red Dust docket into groups of 50 complaints, designated Groups A through I. The parties selected 10 complaints from Group A to proceed to trial as the Group A lead cases. In May 2024, the Court issued an amended case management order with regard to the Group A lead cases scheduling trials to begin in November 2024. The Court further ordered the parties to participate in mediation on or before August 31, 2024. After completing its case analysis in the second quarter of 2024, the Company recorded a reserve for its estimate of probable loss and a related receivable for insurance proceeds with no material impact to the results of operations. Alcoa participated in the court-ordered mediation in August 2024 and reached a settlement agreement to resolve the matter in its entirety, which resulted in no further impact to Alcoa s results of operations. The settlement agreement is conditioned upon obtaining signed release agreements or dismissals from every plaintiff, which is expected to be completed in early 2025. General In addition to the matters discussed above, various other lawsuits, claims, and proceedings have been or may be instituted or asserted against Alcoa Corporation, including those pertaining to environmental, safety and health, commercial, tax, product liability, intellectual property infringement, governance, employment, and employee and retiree benefit matters, and other actions and claims arising out of the normal course of business. While the amounts claimed in these other matters may be substantial, the ultimate liability is not readily determinable because of the considerable uncertainties that exist. Accordingly, it is possible that the Company s liquidity or results of operations in a particular period could be materially affected by one or more of these other matters. However, based on facts currently available, management believes that the disposition of these other matters that are pending or asserted will not have a material adverse effect, individually or in the aggregate, on the financial position of the Company. Contingencies In December 2023, AofA committed to provide a bank guarantee in connection with the approval of the Company s five-year mine plans that were referred to the Western Australia Environmental Protection Agency (WA EPA), which demonstrates Alcoa s confidence that its operations will not impair drinking water supplies. On September 30, 2024 and October 1, 2024, AofA delivered bank guarantees totaling (A ). After March 27, 2025, Alcoa may, with the Western Australian government s consent, replace the bank guarantee with a parent company guarantee or a surety bond. The requirement to provide financial assurance will expire upon the completion of the WA EPA s assessment of the Company s five-year mine plans.

 , the Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of per share of the Company s common stock (including common stock underlying CDIs) and Series A convertible preferred stock, to be paid on to stockholders of record as of the close of business on . Dividends on Alcoa s common and preferred stock are paid in U.S. dollars. Dividends on common stock underlying CDIs paid in a currency other than the U.S. dollar will be determined using foreign currency exchange rates as of November 11, 2024. On October 16, 2024, Alcoa announced that it is progressing toward entering into a strategic cooperation agreement with IGNIS Equity Holdings, SL (IGNIS EQT), the majority shareholder in the IGNIS Group of Companies, a vertically integrated energy company based in Spain, to support the continued operation of the San Cipri n complex. Under the proposed agreement, Alcoa would maintain a majority ownership share of the San Cipri n complex, including continuing as the managing operator, with IGNIS EQT holding percent. The proposed agreement is conditional upon delivery of key areas of cooperation with San Cipri n s stakeholders.

 Business Update 
 During the third quarter 2024, Alcoa continued to execute on its strategic priorities while progressing improvement in its operations as described below. 
 Alcoa completed the acquisition of Alumina Limited on August 1, 2024. The acquisition enhances Alcoa s position as a leading pure play, upstream aluminum company globally, while simplifying the Company s corporate structure and governance, resulting in greater financial flexibility and strategic optionality. 
 On September 15, 2024, Alcoa announced the sale of its 25.1 interest in the Saudi Arabia joint venture to Ma aden. This decision aligns with the Company s ongoing efforts to streamline its operations and is expected to provide Alcoa with enhanced financial flexibility. 
 On October 16, 2024, Alcoa announced that it is progressing toward entering into a strategic cooperation agreement with IGNIS EQT to support the continued operation of the San Cipri n complex. The proposed agreement is conditional upon delivery of key areas of cooperation with San Cipri n s stakeholders. 
 During the third quarter of 2024, Alcoa continued to advance mine approvals for the next major Australian mine regions (Myara North and Holyoake) which were referred for accredited assessment by the Western Australia Environmental Protection Agency (WA EPA) under the bilateral assessment process (Accredited Assessment). Alcoa is focused on modernizing its approvals framework for bauxite mining in the region and securing certainty for ongoing and future operations. 
 The Company continued to execute initiatives to further enhance its operations and reduce controllable costs during the third quarter of 2024. The Mosj en smelter (Norway) and the Company s smelters in Canada set year-to-date production records, while the Alumar smelter steadily improved stability and increased operating capacity to approximately 76 percent at September 30, 2024. 
 Saudi Arabia Joint Venture 
 On September 15, 2024, Alcoa entered into a share purchase and subscription agreement with Ma aden, pursuant to which Alcoa agreed to sell its full ownership interest of 25.1 in the Saudi Arabia joint venture, comprised of the Ma aden Bauxite and Alumina Company and the Ma aden Aluminium Company, to Ma aden in exchange for issuance by Ma aden of approximately 86 million shares and 150 in cash. The implied value of the shares was 950 as of September 12, 2024, based on the volume-weighted average share price of Ma aden for the previous 30 calendar days. The shares of Ma aden will be subject to transfer and sale restrictions. Alcoa will hold its Ma aden shares for a minimum of three years, with one-third of the shares becoming transferable after each of the third, fourth, and fifth anniversaries of closing of the transaction (the holding period). During the holding period, Alcoa would be permitted to hedge and borrow against its Ma aden shares. Under certain circumstances, such minimum holding period would be reduced. The transaction is subject to regulatory approvals, approval by Ma aden s shareholders, and other customary closing conditions and is expected to close in the first half of 2025. The carrying value of Alcoa s investment was 538 as of September 30, 2024. 
 Alumina Limited Acquisition 
 On August 1, 2024, Alcoa completed the acquisition of all of the ordinary shares of Alumina Limited (Alumina Shares) through a wholly owned subsidiary, AAC Investments Australia 2 Pty Ltd. Alumina Limited holds a 40 ownership interest in the AWAC joint venture. Under the Scheme Implementation Deed (the Agreement) entered into in March 2024, as amended in May 2024, holders of Alumina Shares received 0.02854 Alcoa CHESS Depositary Interests (CDIs) for each Alumina Share (the Agreed Ratio), except that i) holders of Alumina Shares represented by American Depositary Shares, each of which represented 4 Alumina Shares, received 0.02854 shares of Alcoa common stock and ii) a certain shareholder received, for certain of their Alumina Shares, 0.02854 shares of Alcoa non-voting convertible preferred stock. The Alcoa CDIs are quoted on the Australian Stock Exchange under the trading symbol AAI. 
 At closing, Alumina Shares outstanding of 2,760,056,014 and 141,625,403 were exchanged for 78,772,422 and 4,041,989 shares of Alcoa common stock and Alcoa preferred stock, respectively. Based on Alcoa s closing share price as of July 31, 2024, the Agreed Ratio implied a value of A 1.45 per Alumina Share and aggregate purchase consideration of approximately 2,700 for Alumina Limited. 
 For Alcoa shareholders, the transaction enhances Alcoa s vertical integration along the value chain across bauxite mining, alumina refining, and aluminum smelting, increases Alcoa s economic interest in its bauxite and alumina assets, simplifies governance, and reaffirms Alcoa s commitment to Western Australia. In addition to the implied premium over prior share prices, Alumina Limited shareholders ownership is diversified to a large-scale, global upstream aluminum portfolio. 
 30 

The transaction consisted in substance of the acquisition of Alumina Limited s noncontrolling interest in AWAC 1,472), the assumption of Alumina Limited s indebtedness 385), the recognition of deferred tax assets 121) primarily related to Alumina Limited s prior net operating losses, and the acquisition of cash 9) and other current liabilities 1). The transaction was accounted for as an equity transaction where net assets acquired 1,216) and transaction costs 32) were reflected as an increase to Additional capital. 
 Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest was recognized through July 31, 2024 and was 8 in the third quarter of 2024. 
 Australia Mine Plan Approvals 
 The Company continued to advance mine approvals for the next major Australian mine regions (Myara North and Holyoake), which were referred for accredited assessment by the WA EPA under the Accredited Assessment. Alcoa began the process in 2020, is focused on receiving approval by the first quarter of 2026, and anticipates mining in new regions will commence no earlier than 2027. Until then, the Company expects bauxite quality will remain similar to recent grades. 
 During the third quarter of 2024, the WA EPA set an indicative timeline for the next key step in the approval process, the public comment period, for early 2025. 
 The Company continues work to seek annual endorsement from the Western Australian State Government for its rolling five-year mine plan. Separately, a third-party referred the Company s current five-year mine plan to the WA EPA in 2023 for assessment (Third-Party Referral). This Third-Party Referral remains under assessment, and it is expected that the public comment period will also be in early 2025 in accordance with the WA EPA streamlined process. 
 The Company is committed to working collaboratively with the WA EPA and other stakeholders to achieve the indicative timelines set by the WA EPA. 
 Additionally, the Company is evaluating conditions recommended by the WA EPA in similar accredited assessment processes to address the majority of relevant published conditions in the Company s Environmental Review Document, which Alcoa will submit as part of the Accredited Assessment prior to the upcoming public comment period. 
 Portfolio Actions 
 Portfolio Review 
 In October 2024, the Company completed its five-year strategic portfolio review to improve cost positioning, or curtail, close, or divest 1.5 million and 4 million metric tons of smelting and refining capacity, respectively. The Company reached approximately 93 percent of its target for smelting capacity with the decision to restart capacity at the Warrick smelter completed in the first quarter 2024, and exceeded its target for refining capacity with the decision to curtail the Kwinana refinery in January 2024. The Company continues to evaluate assets for opportunities for improvement to remain profitable throughout all cycles. 
 Kwinana Refinery 
 In June 2024, Alcoa completed the full curtailment of the Kwinana refinery, as planned, which was announced in January 2024. The Company s decision to fully curtail the refinery was made based on a variety of factors, including the refinery s age, scale, operating costs, and current bauxite grades, in addition to market conditions. 
 Prior to the curtailment, the refinery had been operating at approximately 80 percent of its annual nameplate capacity of 2.2 million metric tons since January 2023, when the Company reduced production in response to a domestic natural gas shortage in Western Australia due to production challenges experienced by key gas suppliers. 
 As of March 2024, the refinery had approximately 780 employees and this number was reduced to approximately 300 in the third quarter of 2024 to manage certain processes that are expected to continue into 2025. At that time, the employee number will be further reduced to approximately 50. 
 San Cipri n Operations 
 On October 16, 2024, Alcoa announced that it is progressing toward entering into a strategic cooperation agreement with IGNIS EQT, the majority shareholder in the IGNIS Group of Companies, a vertically integrated energy company based in Spain, to support the continued operation of the San Cipri n complex. 
 Under the proposed agreement, Alcoa would contribute approximately 82 75), and IGNIS EQT would make an initial investment of approximately 27 25) to fund the operations. Alcoa would continue as the managing operator of the San Cipri n complex, with IGNIS EQT holding 25 percent ownership. Additionally, up to approximately 109 100) would be funded by Alcoa as needed for operations with a priority position in future cash returns. Further funding would require agreement by both partners and would be shared 75 percent by Alcoa and 25 percent by IGNIS EQT. 
 Alcoa has operated the San Cipri n complex for a number of years in a challenging economic environment, primarily due to the high cost of energy. In the first quarter of 2024, Alcoa launched a sale process while also working to identify solutions for the long-term viability of the operations. 
 31 

Despite sharing information with 60 potential investors, no viable bid was made for 100 percent of the San Cipri n complex. The potential partnership with IGNIS EQT emerged as an alternative for San Cipri n in which Alcoa can leverage its expertise in managing global aluminum operations, combined with IGNIS EQT s strong knowledge of energy markets, to create value via market access and energy management services. 
 The proposed agreement is conditional upon delivery of key areas of cooperation with San Cipri n s stakeholders, including the Spanish National Government, the Xunta de Galicia, and San Cipri n employees and workers representatives. Key areas include: 
 Materially higher carbon dioxide compensation support; 

Permitting of power generation projects, especially those with existing agreements with San Cipri 

Support and approval for the bauxite residue area capital project; and, 

Flexibility within the February 2023 updated viability agreement, including access to restricted cash for operating needs and deferral or substitution of capital improvement commitments. 

The refinery and smelter incurred substantial losses in the nine months of 2024 and in prior years, which have been funded with internal credit lines that are nearing their limits and for which the operations have no ability to repay. The operations have approximately 60 of available funding with cash on hand and availability under internal credit lines. Although aluminum and alumina prices have improved during 2024, the San Cipri n complex remains unviable based on current and forward market assumptions for delivered energy in Spain and sales prices. While the Company had restricted cash of 86 remaining at September 30, 2024 (see Aluminum below) to be made available for capital improvements at the site and smelter restart costs, the workers representatives have rejected the use of this cash to fund operating losses at the smelter. Based on economic conditions as of September 30, 2024, the San Cipri n operations are expected to incur losses in 2024 and barring finalizing a partnership agreement with IGNIS EQT, Alcoa anticipates that available funding will be exhausted by the end of 2024. 
 Warrick Operations 
 During the first quarter of 2024, the Company completed the restart of one potline (54,000 mtpy) at its Warrick Operations site in Indiana that began in October 2023, and incurred restart expenses of 3. 
 Other Matters 
 In March 2024, the Company completed an offering of 750 aggregate principal amount of 7.125 percent senior notes due in 2031. This was the Company s first notes issuance under its Green Finance Framework, which prioritizes climate change mitigation expenditures related to circular or low carbon products, pollution prevention technologies, renewable energy, and water management. The Company is utilizing net proceeds from the issuance, which can be allocated to qualifying expenditures on a two-year look back and three-year look forward, to cover expenses associated with both new and existing decarbonization and water management projects, research and development, renewable energy, and the production of low carbon alumina and aluminum products. The net proceeds also support the Company s cash position and ongoing cash needs, including with respect to its previously announced portfolio actions. The Company does not expect to allocate part of the net proceeds to significant capital investments in breakthrough technologies as those are not expected to occur within the applicable time period. 
 During the first quarter of 2024, the Company initiated and fully deployed a productivity and competitiveness program across its global operations and functions. The program is part of the Company s objective to improve overall competitiveness and profitability and includes a target to save approximately 5 percent of operating costs, exclusive of raw materials, energy and transportation costs, which are already under active management and cost control programs. Total savings are expected to approximate 100 on a run rate basis and to be achieved by the first quarter of 2025. 
 The Company paid a quarterly cash dividend of 0.10 per share of the Company s common stock (including common stock underlying CDIs) and Series A convertible preferred stock in August 2024, totaling 26. 
 See the below sections for additional details on the above-described actions.

47 for the updated restart agreement for the San Cipri n aluminum smelter 

21 for the settlement of certain pension benefits 

15 to record additional environmental and asset retirement obligation reserves at previously closed locations 

10 for employee termination and severance costs, primarily related to Kwinana refinery productivity program 

Provision for income taxes 
 Sequential period comparison 
 The Provision for income taxes in the third quarter of 2024 was 86 on income before taxes of 184 or 46.7 . In comparison, the second quarter of 2024 Provision for income taxes was 61 on income before taxes of 92 or 66.3 . 
 
 The increase in tax expense of 25 is primarily attributable to net higher income in the jurisdictions where taxes are paid. 
 Year-to-date comparison 
 The Provision for income taxes in the nine-month period of 2024 was 129 on a loss before taxes of (49) or (263.3) . In comparison, the nine-month period of 2023 Provision for income taxes was 39 on a loss before taxes of (507) or (7.7) . 
 
 The increase in tax expense of 90 is primarily attributable to net higher income in the jurisdictions where taxes are paid. 
 36 

Noncontrolling interest 
 Sequential period comparison 
 Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest was 8 in the third quarter of 2024 compared with 11 in the second quarter of 2024. These amounts are entirely related to Alumina Limited s 40 ownership interest in several affiliated operating entities prior to Alcoa s acquisition of Alumina Limited on August 1, 2024. 
 
 Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest in the third quarter of 2024 reflects favorable average realized price of alumina, partially offset by elimination of intercompany profit in inventory. Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest in the second quarter of 2024 was driven by favorable average realized price of alumina and favorable mark-to-market results on derivative instruments. 
 Year-to-date comparison 
 Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interest was (36) in the nine-month period of 2024 compared with (45) in the nine-month period of 2023. These amounts are entirely related to Alumina Limited s 40 ownership interest in several affiliated operating entities prior to Alcoa s acquisition of Alumina Limited on August 1, 2024. 
 
 Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interest in the nine-month period of 2024 was driven by restructuring costs partially offset by favorable average realized price of alumina. Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interest in the nine-month period of 2023 reflects unfavorable production and raw material costs, and equity losses from the Ma aden bauxite and alumina joint venture, partially offset by favorable mark-to-market results on derivative instruments. 
 
 Segment Information 
 Alcoa Corporation is a producer of bauxite, alumina, and aluminum products. The Company has two operating and reportable segments: (i) Alumina and (ii) Aluminum. Segment performance under Alcoa Corporation s management reporting system is evaluated based on a number of factors; however, the primary measure of performance reported to the CODM is the Adjusted EBITDA (Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) for each segment. The Company calculates Segment Adjusted EBITDA as Total sales (third-party and intersegment) minus the following items: Cost of goods sold; Selling, general administrative, and other expenses; and Research and development expenses. Alcoa Corporation s Segment Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. The CODM function regularly reviews the financial information, including Adjusted EBITDA, of these two operating segments to assess performance and allocate resources. 
 Alumina 
 Business Update. The average API of 496 per metric ton trended favorably compared to the prior quarter reflecting a 27 sequential increase. Compared to the nine-month period of 2023, the average API trended favorably, reflecting a 20 increase year-over-year. The majority of third-party alumina sales are linked to the API and the favorable price trend has resulted in strong results for the segment. 
 Kwinana Refinery 
 In June 2024, Alcoa completed the full curtailment of the Kwinana refinery, as planned, which was announced in January 2024. As of March 2024, the refinery had approximately 780 employees and this number was reduced to approximately 300 in the third quarter of 2024 to manage certain processes that are expected to continue into 2025. At that time, the employee number will be further reduced to approximately 50. In addition to the employees separating as a result of the curtailment, approximately 250 employees have terminated through the productivity program announced in the third quarter of 2023 or redeployed to other Alcoa operations. 
 In the second quarter of 2024, Alcoa recorded restructuring charges of 8 related to the curtailment of the refinery including 6 for water management costs and 2 for contract terminations. In the first quarter of 2024, Alcoa recorded restructuring charges of 197 including 123 for water management costs, 41 for employee related costs, 15 for asset retirement obligations, 13 for take-or-pay contracts, and 5 for asset impairments. Related cash outlays of approximately 225 (which includes existing employee related liabilities and asset retirement obligations) are expected through 2025, with approximately 145 to be spent in 2024. The Company spent 72 and 96 against the reserve in the third quarter and nine-month period of 2024, respectively. 
 37 

Capacity. The Alumina segment had a base capacity of 13,843 kmt with 3,204 kmt of curtailed refining capacity. There was no change in curtailed capacity during the quarter. 
 Total alumina shipments include metric tons that were not produced by the Alumina segment. Such alumina was purchased to satisfy certain customer commitments. The Alumina segment bears the risk of loss of the purchased alumina until control of the product has been transferred to this segment s customers. Additionally, operating costs in the table below includes all production related costs: raw materials consumed; conversion costs, such as labor, materials, and utilities; depreciation and amortization; and plant administrative expenses.

38 

Third-party sales 
 Sequential period comparison 
 Third-party sales increased 86 primarily as a result of: 
 Higher average realized price of 86/ton principally driven by a higher average API 

Partially offset by: 
 Lower shipments of alumina primarily due to the full curtailment of the Kwinana refinery and decreased trading activity, partially offset by increased sales of externally sourced alumina to satisfy certain customer contracts 

Unfavorable currency impacts 

Year-to-date comparison 
 Third-party sales increased 359 primarily as a result of: 
 Higher average realized price of 54/ton principally driven by a higher average API 

Higher shipments of alumina primarily due to increased sales of externally sourced alumina to satisfy certain customer commitments 

Partially offset by: 
 Lower volumes and price from bauxite offtake and supply agreements primarily caused by the shift to intrasegment sales due to higher production at the San Cipri n refinery

Forward Look. For the fourth quarter of 2024 in comparison to the third quarter of 2024, the Alumina segment anticipates higher shipments and lower production costs. 
 
 Alcoa expects total 2024 Alumina segment production to remain unchanged from the prior projection, ranging between 9.8 and 10.0 million metric tons. The Company is increasing its projection for shipments to range between 12.9 and 13.1 million metric tons, an increase of 0.2 million metric tons from the prior projection primarily due to increased trading volumes. The difference between production and shipments reflects trading volumes and externally sourced alumina to fulfill customer contracts due to the curtailment of the Kwinana refinery. 
 39 

Aluminum 
 Business Update. Aluminum prices decreased sequentially with LME prices on a 15-day lag averaging 2,372 per metric ton in the third quarter of 2024. 
 During the third quarter of 2024, the Company maintained the controlled pace for the restart of the Alumar smelter and continued actions to improve the smelter s overall performance. The restart resumed in the prior quarter after the smelter experienced operational instability in the first quarter of 2024. The site was operating at approximately 76 percent of the site s total annual capacity of 268 kmt (Alcoa share) as of September 30, 2024. 
 In April 2024, the U.S. Treasury, in coordination with the United Kingdom, announced sanctions on Russian aluminum. The sanctions ban imports into the U.S. and the United Kingdom of Russian Federation origin aluminum produced on or after April 13, 2024, and restrict activity at the London Metal Exchange and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. 
 In March 2024, Alcoa completed the restart of approximately 54,000 mtpy of capacity at its Warrick Operations site in Indiana that began in October 2023. Alcoa incurred restart expenses of 3 during the first quarter of 2024. 
 San Cipri n Smelter 
 In March 2024, Alcoa completed the restart of approximately 6 percent of total pots at the San Cipri n smelter as required by the February 2023 updated viability agreement. The Company incurred restart expenses 4 during the nine-month period of 2024. In connection with the December 2021 agreement and the February 2023 updated viability agreement, the Company has restricted cash of 86 remaining at September 30, 2024 to be made available for capital improvements at the site and smelter restart costs. The workers representatives have rejected the use of this cash to fund operating losses at the smelter. 
 Total aluminum third-party shipments include metric tons that were not produced by the Aluminum segment. Such aluminum was purchased by this segment to satisfy certain customer commitments. The Aluminum segment bears the risk of loss of the purchased aluminum until control of the product has been transferred to this segment s customer. Additionally, Total shipments includes offtake from a joint venture supply agreement. 
 The average realized third-party price per metric ton of aluminum includes three elements: a) the underlying base metal component, based on quoted prices from the LME; b) the regional premium, which represents the incremental price over the base LME component that is associated with the physical delivery of metal to a particular region (e.g., the Midwest premium for metal sold in the United States); and c) the product premium, which represents the incremental price for receiving physical metal in a particular shape (e.g., billet, slab, rod, etc.) or alloy. 
 Operating costs includes all production related costs: raw materials consumed; conversion costs, such as labor, materials, and utilities; depreciation and amortization; and plant administrative expenses.

(1) These figures represent Alcoa Corporation s share of the facility Nameplate Capacity based on its ownership interest in the respective smelter. 

(2) In the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company began the restart of 16,000 mtpy of previously curtailed capacity at the Portland smelter in Australia. The smelter had previously been operating at approximately 75 percent of the site s annual capacity of 197,000 mtpy (Alcoa share) since March 2023. 

(3) In 2021, the Company announced the restart of its 268,000 metric tons per year (mtpy) share of capacity at the Alumar smelter in S o Lu s, Brazil. Production began in the second quarter of 2022. Curtailed capacity decreased from September 30, 2023 as a result of the restart process. 

(4) In December 2021, the Company announced a two-year curtailment of the San Cipri n smelter s 228,000 mtpy of annual smelting capacity. In February 2023, the Company and the workers representatives reached an updated viability agreement for the phased restart of the smelter beginning in January 2024. In the first quarter of 2024, the Company completed the restart of approximately 6 of pots, in accordance with the updated viability agreement. 

(5) In the first quarter of 2024, the Company completed the restart of one potline (54,000 mtpy) at its Warrick Operations site that began in October 2023. The line was curtailed in July 2022. In the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company also approved the permanent closure of 54,000 mtpy of previously curtailed capacity (which had not operated since 2016). 

Forward Look. For the fourth quarter of 2024 in comparison to the third quarter of 2024, the Aluminum segment expects lower energy costs and increased shipments to be offset by higher production costs. 
 The Company expects total 2024 Aluminum segment production and shipments to remain unchanged from the prior projection, ranging between 2.2 and 2.3 million metric tons and between 2.5 and 2.6 million metric tons, respectively.

Environmental Matters 
 See the Environmental Matters section of Note O to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I Item 1 of this Form 10-Q. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Management believes that the Company s cash on hand, projected cash flows, and liquidity options, combined with its strategic actions, will be adequate to fund its short-term (at least 12 months) and long-term operating and investing needs. The Company plans to opportunistically access liquidity sources to support its cash position and ongoing cash needs. Further, the Company has flexibility related to its use of cash; other than the Alumina Limited debt assumed as of August 1, 2024, the Company has no significant debt maturities until 2027 and no significant cash contribution requirements related to its pension plan obligations. Alcoa is considering potential repayment or refinancing options for the Alumina Limited debt assumed. 
 Although management believes that Alcoa s projected cash flows and other liquidity options will provide adequate resources to fund operating and investing needs, the Company s access to, and the availability of, financing on acceptable terms in the future will be affected by many factors, including: (i) Alcoa Corporation s credit rating; (ii) the liquidity of the overall capital markets; (iii) the current state of the economy and commodity markets, and (iv) short- and long-term debt ratings. There can be no assurances that the Company will continue to have access to capital markets on terms acceptable to Alcoa Corporation. 
 Changes in market conditions caused by global or macroeconomic events, such as ongoing regional conflicts, high inflation, and changing global monetary policies could have adverse effects on Alcoa s ability to obtain additional financing and cost of borrowing. Inability to generate sufficient earnings could impact the Company s ability to meet the financial covenants in our outstanding debt and revolving credit facility agreements and limit our ability to access these sources of liquidity or refinance or renegotiate our outstanding debt or credit agreements on terms acceptable to the Company. Additionally, the impact on market conditions from such events could adversely affect the liquidity of Alcoa s customers, suppliers, and joint venture partners and equity method investments, which could negatively impact the collectability of outstanding receivables and our cash flows. 
 Cash from Operations 
 Cash provided from operations was 207 in the nine-month period of 2024 compared with cash used for operations of 107 in the same period of 2023. Notable changes to sources and (uses) of cash included: 
 423 favorable change in net loss, excluding the impacts from restructuring charges, primarily due to lower raw material and energy costs, higher alumina pricing, partially offset by lower aluminum pricing and a decrease in value add product sales; 

133 less income taxes paid on prior year earnings, as well as on lower current year earnings in the jurisdictions where taxes are paid; partially offset by, 

271) in certain working capital accounts in the nine-month period of 2024, primarily an increase in receivables driven by less favorable payment terms and timing of shipments, and a decrease in accounts payable due to lower raw material volumes in the Alumina segment, partially offset by a decrease in inventories due to lower raw material volumes in the Aluminum segment. 

During 2024, AofA will continue to record its tax provision and tax liability without effect of the ATO assessment, since it expects to prevail. The tax payable related to deductions of interest on the assessment will remain on AofA s balance sheet as a noncurrent liability, increased by the tax effect of subsequent periods interest deductions, until dispute resolution. At September 30, 2024, the noncurrent liability resulting from the cumulative interest deductions was 222 (A 322). See description of the tax dispute in Note O to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I Item 1 of this Form 10-Q. 
 The Company utilizes a Receivables Purchase Agreement facility to sell up to 130 of certain receivables through an SPE to a financial institution on a revolving basis. Alcoa Corporation guarantees the performance obligations of the Company subsidiaries, and unsold customer receivables are pledged as collateral to the financial institution to secure the sold receivables. At September 30, 2024, the SPE held unsold customer receivables of 266 pledged as collateral against the sold receivables. 
 The Company continues to service the customer receivables that were transferred to the financial institution. As Alcoa collects customer payments, the SPE transfers additional receivables to the financial institution rather than remitting cash. In the nine-month period of 2024, the Company sold gross customer receivables of 886 and reinvested collections of 870 from previously sold receivables, resulting in net cash proceeds from the financial institution of 16. In the nine-month period of 2023, the Company sold gross customer receivables of 320 and reinvested collections of 221 from previously sold receivables, resulting in net cash proceeds from the financial institution of 99. Cash collections from previously sold receivables yet to be reinvested of 90 were included in Accounts payable, trade on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet as of September 30, 2024. Cash received from sold receivables under the agreement are presented within operating activities in the Statement of Consolidated Cash Flows. See Note I to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I Item 1 of this Form 10-Q. 
 44 

Financing Activities 
 Cash provided from financing activities was 595 in the nine-month period of 2024 compared with 51 in the same period of 2023. 
 The source of cash in the nine-month period of 2024 was primarily 737 of net proceeds from the bond issuance (see below) and 16 of net contributions from Alumina Limited (see Noncontrolling interest above), partially offset by 63 of dividends paid on common stock, 44 of net payments on short-term borrowings (see below), and 23 net cash outflows from the acquisition of Alumina Limited (see Note C to the Consolidated Financial Statement in Part I Item 1 of this Form 10-Q) . 
 Short-term Borrowings 
 The Company has entered into inventory repurchase agreements whereby the Company sold aluminum to a third party and agreed to subsequently repurchase substantially similar inventory. The Company did not record sales upon each shipment of inventory and the net cash received of 12 related to these agreements was recorded in Short-term borrowings within Other current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of September 30, 2024. 
 During the nine-month period of 2024, the Company recorded borrowings of 45 and repurchased 89 of inventory related to these agreements. During the nine-month period of 2023, the Company recorded borrowings of 80 and repurchased 38 of inventory related to these agreements. 
 The cash received and subsequently paid under the inventory repurchase agreements is included in Cash provided from financing activities on the Statement of Consolidated Cash Flows. 
 144A Debt 
 In March 2024, ANHBV, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Alcoa Corporation, completed a Rule 144A (U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended) debt issuance for 750 aggregate principal amount of 7.125 Senior Notes due 2031 (the 2031 Notes), which carry a green bond designation. The net proceeds of this issuance were 737, reflecting a discount to the initial purchasers of the 2031 Notes as well as issuance costs. See Note K to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I Item 1 of this Form 10-Q. 
 Credit Facilities 
 Revolving Credit Facility 
 The Company has a 1,250 revolving credit and letter of credit facility in place for working capital and/or other general corporate purposes (the Revolving Credit Facility). The Revolving Credit Facility, established in September 2016, amended and restated in June 2022 and amended in January 2024, is scheduled to mature in June 2027. Subject to the terms and conditions under the Revolving Credit Facility, the Company or ANHBV, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Alcoa Corporation, may borrow funds or issue letters of credit. Under the terms of the January 2024 amendment, the Company agreed to provide collateral for its obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility. See Part II Item 8 of Alcoa Corporation s Annual Report on Form 10-K in Note M to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2023 for more information on the Revolving Credit Facility. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company was in compliance with all financial covenants. The Company may access the entire amount of commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility. There were no borrowings outstanding at September 30, 2024, and no amounts were borrowed during the nine-month periods of 2024 and 2023 under the Revolving Credit Facility. 
 Japanese Yen Revolving Credit Facility 
 The Company entered into a 250 revolving credit facility available to be drawn in Japanese yen (the Japanese Yen Revolving Credit Facility) in April 2023. The Japanese Revolving Credit Facility was amended in January 2024 and in April 2024 (see below) and is scheduled to mature in April 2025. Subject to the terms and conditions under the facility, the Company or ANHBV may borrow funds. The facility includes covenants that are substantially the same as those included in the Revolving Credit Facility. Under the current terms of the January 2024 amendment, the Company agreed to provide collateral for its obligations under the Japanese Yen Revolving Credit Facility. See Part II Item 8 of Alcoa Corporation s Annual Report on Form 10-K in Note M to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2023 for more information on the Japanese Yen Revolving Credit Facility. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company was in compliance with all financial covenants. The Company may access the entire amount of commitments under the Japanese Revolving Credit Facility. There were no borrowings outstanding at September 30, 2024. During the nine-month period of 2024, 201 (29,686 JPY) was borrowed and 196 (29,686 JPY) was repaid. No amounts were borrowed during the nine-month period of 2023 under the Japanese Yen Revolving Credit Facility. 
 On April 26, 2024, the Company entered into an amendment extending the maturity of the Japanese Yen Revolving Credit Facility to April 2025. 
 45 

Alumina Limited Revolving Credit Facility 
 In connection with the acquisition of Alumina Limited, the Company assumed 385 of indebtedness as of August 1, 2024, representing the amount drawn on Alumina Limited s revolving credit facility. 
 At acquisition, the Alumina Limited revolving credit facility had tranches maturing in October 2025 100), January 2026 150), July 2026 150), and June 2027 100). In August 2024, Alcoa cancelled the undrawn portions of the revolving credit facility maturing in July 2026 15) and June 2027 100). The Alumina Limited revolving credit facility contains a financial covenant limiting the incurrence of indebtedness. As of September 30, 2024, the Company was in compliance with such covenant. 
 The Alumina Limited revolving credit facility also contains a clause that allows a majority of lenders, upon a change of control, to issue a notice requiring repayment within 90 business days of issuing the notice (the 90-day Notice). The lenders have indicated their intention to delay issuing the 90-day Notice until at least December 1, 2024, providing additional time for Alcoa to consider potential repayment or refinancing options. 
 As of September 30, 2024, indebtedness under the Alumina Limited revolving credit facility is included in Long-term debt due within one year. 
 Bank Guarantee 
 In December 2023, AofA committed to provide a bank guarantee in connection with the approval of the Company s five-year mine plans that were referred to the Western Australia Environmental Protection Agency (WA EPA), which demonstrates Alcoa s confidence that its operations will not impair drinking water supplies. On September 30, 2024 and October 1, 2024, AofA delivered bank guarantees totaling 69 (A 100). After March 27, 2025, Alcoa may, with the Western Australian government s consent, replace the bank guarantee with a parent company guarantee or a surety bond. The requirement to provide financial assurance will expire upon the completion of the WA EPA s assessment of the Company s five-year mine plans. 
 Dividend 
 On October 16, 2024, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of 0.10 per share of the Company s common stock (including common stock underlying CDIs) and Series A convertible preferred stock, to be paid on November 15, 2024 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on October 29, 2024.

In August 2024, the Company paid cash dividends of 26. 
 Ratings 
 Alcoa Corporation s cost of borrowing and ability to access the capital markets are affected not only by market conditions but also by the short- and long-term debt ratings assigned to Alcoa Corporation s debt by the major credit rating agencies.

 PART II OTHE R INFORMATION 
 Item 1. Leg al Proceedings. 
 (in millions) 
 In the ordinary course of its business, Alcoa is involved in a number of lawsuits and claims, both actual and potential. Various lawsuits, claims, and proceedings have been or may be instituted or asserted against Alcoa Corporation, including those pertaining to environmental, safety and health, commercial, tax, product liability, intellectual property infringement, governance, employment, employee and retiree benefit matters, and other actions and claims arising out of the normal course of business. While the amounts claimed in these other matters may be substantial, the ultimate liability is not readily determinable because of the considerable uncertainties that exist. Accordingly, it is possible that the Company s liquidity or results of operations in a particular period could be materially affected by one or more of these other matters. However, based on facts currently available, management believes that the disposition of these other matters that are pending or asserted will not have a material adverse effect, individually or in the aggregate, on the financial position of the Company. 
 A discussion of our material pending lawsuits and claims can be found in Part I Item 3 Legal Proceedings of Alcoa Corporation s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. 
 St. Croix Proceedings Prior to 2012, Alcoa Inc., the Company s former parent company, was served with two multi-plaintiff actions alleging personal injury or property damage from Hurricane Georges or winds blowing material from the Company s former St. Croix alumina facility. These actions were subsequently consolidated into the Red Dust Claims docket in 2017. 
 In March 2022, the Superior Court of the Virgin Islands issued an amended case management order dividing complaints filed in the Red Dust docket into groups of 50 complaints, designated Groups A through I. The parties selected 10 complaints from Group A to proceed to trial as the Group A lead cases. In May 2024, the Court issued an amended case management order with regard to the Group A lead cases scheduling trials to begin in November 2024. Alcoa participated in court-ordered mediation in August 2024 and reached a settlement agreement to resolve the matter in its entirety. The settlement agreement is conditioned upon obtaining signed release agreements or dismissals from every plaintiff, which is expected to be completed in early 2025. See St. Croix Proceedings under Part I Item 1 of this Form 10-Q in Note O to the Consolidated Financial Statements and St. Croix Proceedings - Abednego and Abraham cases under Part I Item 3 Legal Proceedings of Alcoa Corporation s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 for additional information regarding this legal proceeding. 
 47 

Environmental Matters 
 SEC regulations require disclosure of certain environmental matters when a governmental authority is a party to the proceedings and such proceedings involve potential monetary sanctions that Alcoa Corporation reasonably believes will exceed a specified threshold. Pursuant to these regulations, the Company uses a threshold of 1 for purposes of determining whether disclosure of any such proceedings is required. 
 Intalco (Washington) Notice of Violation In May 2022, the Company received a Notice of Violation (NOV) from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the EPA). The NOV alleges violations under the Clean Air Act at the Company s Intalco smelter from when the smelter was operational. The EPA referred the matter to the U.S. Department of Justice, Environment and Natural Resources Division (the DOJ) in May 2022. The DOJ and the Company agreed to a stipulated settlement, which was filed with the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington at Seattle on July 18, 2024, requiring the Company to pay a civil fine of 5. On October 15, 2024, the Court approved the stipulated settlement of 5, and payment has been remitted by the Company. 
 Item 1A. R isk Factors. 
 We face a number of risks that could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flow, liquidity, or financial condition. A full discussion of our risk factors can be found in Part I Item 1A. Risk Factors of Alcoa Corporation s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. The information below includes additional risks relating to the completion of the Alumina Limited acquisition. 
 The issuance of shares of Alcoa common stock dilutes the ownership position of the Company s existing stockholders and the price of Alcoa common stock may be affected. 
 The Alumina Limited shareholders now beneficially own approximately 31.5 of the fully diluted shares of Alcoa common stock (including the shares of Alcoa common stock issuable upon conversion of the shares of non-voting convertible preferred stock). Consequently, the Company s existing stockholders own a smaller proportion of Alcoa common stock and of the Company s voting power than the proportion of Alcoa common stock and of the Company s voting power owned before the completion of the Alumina Limited acquisition and, as a result, have less influence on the Company s management and policies. 
 The issuance of the new shares of Alcoa common stock could have the effect of depressing the market price for Alcoa common stock. In addition, Alumina Limited shareholders may decide not to hold and instead to sell the new shares of Alcoa common stock or CDIs received, which could have the effect of depressing the market price for Alcoa common stock. 
 The secondary listing of the Alcoa common stock on the ASX via CDIs could lead to price variations and other impacts on the price of Alcoa common stock. 
 Alcoa common stock is listed as CDIs on the ASX in addition to its existing primary listing on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). 
 Dual listing may result in price variations between Alcoa s securities listed on the different exchanges due to a number of factors, including that Alcoa common stock listed on the NYSE is traded in U.S. dollars and CDIs listed on the ASX are traded in Australian dollars, inherently introducing exchange rate volatility, and differences between the trading schedules and time zones of the two exchanges, among other factors. A decrease in the price of Alcoa s securities in one market may result in a decrease in the price of Alcoa s securities in the other market. Dual listing also presents the Company with the opportunity to raise additional funds through the issuance of CDIs, which could cause dilution to stockholders. 
 The integration of Alumina Limited will subject Alcoa to liabilities that exist or may exist at Alumina Limited. 
 The integration of Alumina Limited with Alcoa may pose special risks, including write-offs and unanticipated costs or charges, and will subject the Company to liabilities that exist or may exist at Alumina Limited, including liabilities relating to Alumina Limited s revolving credit facility and potential tax liabilities. Although Alcoa and its advisers conducted due diligence on the operations of Alumina Limited, there can be no guarantee that Alcoa is aware of all liabilities of Alumina Limited. These liabilities, and any additional risks and uncertainties related to the transaction not currently known to Alcoa or that Alcoa may currently deem immaterial or unlikely to occur, could negatively impact Alcoa s business, financial condition, and results of operations.

(1) On July 20, 2022, Alcoa Corporation announced that its Board of Directors approved a common stock repurchase program under which the Company may purchase shares of its outstanding common stock up to an aggregate transactional value of 500, depending on the Company s continuing analysis of market, financial, and other factors (the July 2022 authorization). 

As of the date of this report, the Company is currently authorized to repurchase up to a total of 500, in the aggregate, of its outstanding shares of common stock under the July 2022 authorization. Repurchases under this program may be made using a variety of methods, which may include open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, or pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 plan. This program may be suspended or discontinued at any time and does not have a predetermined expiration date. Alcoa Corporation intends to retire repurchased shares of common stock.

I tem 5. Other Information. 
 Trading Arrangements 
 ne of the Company s directors or officers, as defined in Rule 16a-1(f) of the Exchange Act, adopted, modified, or terminated a Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement or a non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement, as each term is defined in Item 408 of Regulation S-K, during the Company s fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024. 
 Amended and Restated Bylaws 
 On July 31, 2024, the Company s Board of Directors approved the Amended and Restated Bylaws of Alcoa Corporation (Alcoa), effective as of such date (the Amended and Restated Bylaws). Among other updates, the Amended and Restated Bylaws include certain changes to the notice procedures by which stockholders may recommend nominees for election to the Board, including: 
 Removal of the acting in concert definition and amendment of provisions in Section 2.9(C)(1)(a) (c) and Section 9.1(E)(2), so that a stockholder does not have any requirement to disclose information with respect to others acting in concert in a stockholder s notice provided in connection with any nominations or business at an annual meeting of stockholders; 

clarification that, if the first public announcement of the date of a special meeting to nominate directors is less than 100 days prior to the date of such special meeting, a stockholder notice to nominate directors must be delivered by the 10 th day following the day on which the public announcement is first made of the date of the special meeting, removing the proviso that the nominees of the Board also be included in that public announcement; 

removal from the required information in stockholder nomination notices information relating to (i) performance-related fees payable to the stockholder, and (ii) equity interests or derivative instruments held by the stockholder in a competitor company; and, 

clarification that the form of written questionnaire required for a person nominated by a stockholder for election or reelection to the Board be the same as that required of the Board s director nominees. 

On February 21, 2024, Plaintiff Robert Garfield (Plaintiff), on behalf of himself and all similarly situated stockholders of Alcoa, filed a putative class action complaint styled Robert Garfield v. Mary Anne Citrino, et al. , 2024-0158-JTL (Del. Ch.) (the Action), against Alcoa and its directors (collectively, Defendants) alleging breaches of fiduciary duty in connection with the approval, adoption, and maintenance of certain provisions in Alcoa s Amended and Restated Bylaws, effective July 26, 2023 (the Bylaws). Alcoa and the director defendants do not believe the Bylaws required amendment under applicable law and deny that any breach of fiduciary duties or other wrongful conduct occurred, and solely to avoid the costs, distractions, and uncertainties inherent in litigation, on July 31, 2024, amended the Bylaws, which mooted Plaintiff s claims. On August 13, 2024, the Court entered an Order dismissing the Action with prejudice as to Plaintiff and without prejudice as to any actual or potential claims of any other members of the putative class, retaining jurisdiction solely for the purpose of determining Plaintiff s counsel s application for attorneys fees and reimbursement of expenses (the Fee Application). To avoid the time and expense of continued litigation, the parties agreed to resolve the Fee Application in exchange for a payment by Alcoa of 325,000 to Plaintiff s counsel. Defendants will advise the Court that this disclosure has been issued, whereupon the Court will no longer retain jurisdiction over the Action, and the Action will be closed for all purposes.
