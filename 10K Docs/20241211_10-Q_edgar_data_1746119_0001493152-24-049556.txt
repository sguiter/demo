ITEM 3 QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES
ABOUT MARKET RISK 

As a smaller reporting company as defined
by Item 10 of Regulation S-K, the Company is not required to provide information required by this Item. 

ITEM 4 CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures: 

We carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness
of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) as of
October 31, 2024. This evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and
our Chief Financial Officer. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of
October 31, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective due to the presence of material weaknesses in internal control
over financial reporting. 

A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination
of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement
of the company s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Management has identified
the following material weaknesses which have caused management to conclude that, as of October 31, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures
were not effective: (i) inadequate segregation of duties and effective risk assessment; and (ii) insufficient written policies and procedures
for accounting and financial reporting with respect to the requirements and application of both US GAAP and SEC guidelines. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting: 

There were no changes in our internal control over
financial reporting during the quarter ended October 31, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect,
our internal control over financial reporting.
