 On the Closing Date, the Company issued shares of Common Stock of the Company, at a price of per share for aggregate gross proceeds of million (the "First PIPE Investment"). The shares of Common Stock issued in the First PIPE Investment were offered in a private placement under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ). Upon the closing of the Business Combination, an associated marketing fee of million was paid in full, and was recognized as an offset to the proceeds from the First PIPE Investment within Additional paid-in capital in the unaudited condensed consolidated statement of stockholders' equity (deficit)/net parent investment as of September 30, 2024 (Successor). 
 
 On September 26, 2024, the Company issued shares of Common Stock of the Company, at a price of per share for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately million (the "Second PIPE Investment"). The shares of Common Stock issued in the Second PIPE Investment were offered in a private placement under the Securities Act. Upon the closing of the Second PIPE Investment, an associated marketing fee and legal fees of approximately million was accrued in full, and was recognized as an offset to the proceeds from the Second PIPE Investment within Additional paid-in capital in the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet and statement of stockholders' equity (deficit)/net parent investment as of September 30, 2024 (Successor). 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, warrant holders had exercised Warrants for shares of Common Stock resulting in approximately million in cash proceeds to the Company. On October 3, 2024, Sable issued a press release announcing the redemption of all of its outstanding Public Warrants to purchase shares of Common Stock that were issued under the Warrant Agreement, as part of the units sold in the Company IPO.

million and an accumulated deficit of million. The Company expects to continue to incur losses until we can restart production of the SYU Assets. 
 
 Following the Closing Date and through September 30, 2024, management has addressed capital funding needs with the First PIPE Investment, the consummation of the Business Combination, the Second PIPE Investment, and proceeds from the exercise of warrants (refer to Note 7 Warrants for additional details regarding the warrant exercises). Management believes the Company has sufficient capital to maintain operations and complete the repairs necessary to restart production of the SYU Assets. However, the Company s plans for production restart are contingent upon approvals from federal, state and local regulators. Additionally, if the Company s estimates of the costs of restarting production are less than the actual amounts necessary to do so, the Company may have insufficient funds available to operate its business prior to first production and will need to raise additional capital. If the Company is unable to raise additional capital, it may be required to take additional measures to conserve liquidity, which could include, among other things, reducing overhead expenses. The Company cannot provide any assurance that new financing will be available to it on commercially acceptable terms, if at all. 
 
 Due to the remaining regulatory approvals necessary to restart production, along with the timing of ongoing construction repair efforts, substantial doubt exists about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements included in this Quarterly Report do not include any adjustments relating to the recovery of the recorded assets or the classification of the liabilities that could be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern. 
 
 Risks and Uncertainties 
 
 Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 
 
 On August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the IR Act was signed into federal law. The IR Act provides for, among other things, a new U.S. federal 1 excise tax on certain repurchases of stock by publicly traded U.S. domestic corporations and certain U.S. domestic subsidiaries of publicly traded foreign corporations occurring on or after January 1, 2023 as Section 4501 of the Internal Revenue Code (the "Stock Buyback Tax"). The excise tax is imposed on the repurchasing corporation itself, not its shareholders from whom shares are repurchased. The amount of the excise tax is generally 1 of the fair market value of the shares repurchased at the time of the repurchase. However, for purposes of calculating the excise tax, repurchasing corporations are permitted to net the fair market value of certain new stock issuances against the fair market value of stock repurchases made during the same taxable year. In addition, certain exceptions apply to the excise tax. The U.S. Department of the Treasury (the U.S. Treasury has been given authority to provide regulations and other guidance to carry out and prevent the abuse or avoidance of the excise tax. 
 
 The Company has accrued an excise tax payable of million relating to redemptions of Common Stock prior to the Business Combination, which is recorded as a liability on our unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2024 (Successor). 
 
 On June 28, 2024, the U.S. Treasury issued regulations (the "Final Procedural Regulations") finalizing proposed rules regarding the reporting and payment of the non-deductible 1 Stock Buyback Tax. Under the Final Procedural

 Long-term debt was not allocated to SYU as it was a legal obligation of EM, which was not directly impacted by the sale of SYU to Sable. 
 
 Management believes the allocation methodologies used in the Predecessor financial statements are reasonable and result in an allocation of EM s indirect costs of operating SYU as a stand-alone entity. These Predecessor financial statements may not be indicative of the future performance of SYU and do not necessarily reflect what the results of operations,

Emerging Growth Company Status 
 
 The Company is an emerging growth company, as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, (the Securities Act ), as modified by the Jumpstart our Business Startups Act of 2012, (the JOBS Act ), and it may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in its periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. 
 
 Further, Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies (that is, those that have not had a Securities Act registration statement declared effective or do not have a class of securities registered under the Exchange Act) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standards. The JOBS Act provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such election to opt out is irrevocable. The Company has elected not to opt out of such extended transition period which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies, the Company, as an emerging growth company, can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard. This may make comparison of the Company s financial statements with another public company which is neither an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company which has opted out of using the extended transition period difficult or impossible because of the potential differences in accounting standards used.

million to the plaintiffs' counsel in the Grey Fox Matter. The Letter of Credit was issued by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. JPMorgan and required the Company to enter into a cash collateral agreement (the Collateral Agreement with JPMorgan on May 7, 2024. Pursuant to the Collateral Agreement, the Company depos ited million in to a collateral account (the Collateral Account ), which is pledged as collateral to JPMorgan as the issuer of the Letter of Credit. Pursuant to the terms of the Settlement Agreement, the plaintiffs' counsel in the Grey Fox Matter may draw upon the Letter of Credit at a future date upon satisfaction of certain conditions, and the funds held in the Collateral Account are legally restricted to reimburse JPMorgan for such draws, in addition to any related fees and expenses. Additionally, pursuant to the Settlement Agreement, the Company will pay interest on the million to the Grey Fox plaintiffs at the rate earned on the Collateral Account (the "Interest Payable"); provided however that the Company is entitled to reduce the Interest Payable by the ordinary and customary expenses charged to the Company from JPMorgan as the issuer of the Letter of Credit, capped at million. Subject to the court s final approval of the Settlement Agreement, the million deposit in the Collateral Account and Interest Payable are payable upon the final payment date, which must occur no later than June 30, 2025 (the "Final Payment Date"). 
 
 Prior to the Final Payment Date, the Interest Payable is not legally restricted and is available for the Company's use. However, the Company has adopted an accounting policy to consider interest that is both (i) earned on cash that is legally restricted in relation to a legal settlement and (ii) payable as a part of such settlement, such as the Interest Payable, restricted for presentation purposes. Accordingly, the million deposit in the Collateral Account and the related Interest Payable are presented within the restricted cash balance presented on the Company s unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2024. 

million. At September 30, 2024 the Company did not experience losses on this account. 

During the period from January 1, 2024 through February 13, 2024 (Predecessor) and the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 (Predecessor), there were no related party transactions, except for the management and administrative services. SYU previously received management and administrative services from EM, a portion of which was attributable to SYU. Additionally, cash that was received on behalf of SYU by EM created a receivable for SYU, while expenditures made by EM on behalf of SYU created a payable for SYU. The net receivable or payable from all cash activity attributable to SYU is reflected as Due to related party, net on the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet.

SYU has been shut in since 2015 due to a pipeline incident but has been maintained to preserve it in an operation-ready state and thus no depreciation, depletion or amortization has been recorded by the Company since its acquisition of the SYU Asset s. Depreciation, depletion, amortization, and accretion expense for oil and gas properties for the three months ended September 30, 2024 (Successor) and the period February 14, 2024 through September 30, 2024 (Successor) consisted solely of accretion expense in the amount of million and million, respectively.

As discussed in Note 1 Organization, Business Operations, and Going Concern above, on November 1, 2022, the Sable-EM Purchase Agreement was executed to sell SYU for consideration consisting of a seller financed note payable of approximately million and cash of million before purchase price adjustments. Accordingly, during the year ended December 31, 2022, the SYU assets were written down by the Predecessor to their estimated fair value resulting in an impairment of approximately billion. There were impairments recognized during the periods February 14, 2024 through September 30, 2024 (Successor), January 1, 2024 through February 13, 2024 (Predecessor), or the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 (Predecessor).

and negative for the Successor three months ended September 30, 2024 and the period from February 14, 2024 through September 30, 2024, respectively. The effective tax rates differ from the statutory tax rate of 21 for the Successor periods ended September 30, 2024, due primarily to changes in the valuation allowance on the deferred tax assets and disallowed expenses. 
 
 Deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements, which will result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future. In evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax-planning strategies, and results of recent operations. In projecting future taxable income, we begin with historical results and incorporate assumptions about the amount of future federal and state pretax operating income adjusted for items that do not have tax consequences. Based on our ongoing assessment of all available evidence, both positive and negative, we concluded that it was more likely than not that our U.S. deferred tax assets in excess of deferred tax liabilities would not be realized. Also, in scheduling the reversals of our existing timing differences for the Successor period, we concluded that certain deferred tax liabilities in future periods do not have deferred tax assets available to offset, which is primarily due to our net operating losses being limited to 80 of taxable income on an annual basis. Therefore, a further valuation allowance of our deferred tax assets in excess of our liabilities is necessary and results in deferred tax expense for the Successor period. Our judgment regarding the likelihood of realization of these deferred tax assets could change in future periods, which could result in a material impact to our income tax provision in the period of change.

million. The initial principal balance was increased by million for material and supplies and million for paid-in-kind interest from the effective date through the Closing Date less an million cash deposit (which was paid on the Closing Date). The proceeds of the Senior Secured Term Loan were deemed funded on the Closing Date in connection with consummation of the Sable-EM Purchase Agreement. The Senior Secured Term Loan bears interest at ten percent per annum (computed on a 360-day year). Unless Sable elects in writing prior to an applicable interest payment date to pay accrued but unpaid interest in cash, all such accrued and unpaid interest shall be compounded annually on January 1st of each year by adding the relevant amount to the then outstanding principal amount of the Senior Secured Term Loan ("paid-in-kind interest"). The Senior Secured Term Loan matures on the earliest to occur of (i) the anniversary of the applicable effective time (such effective time, 12:00:01 a.m. (Houston Time) on January 1, 2022), (ii) days after Restart Production (i.e., days after first production from the wells) under and as defined in the Sable-EM Purchase Agreement or (iii) acceleration of the term loan in accordance with the terms of the Senior Secured Term Loan. 
 
 The Senior Secured Term Loan dated as of the Closing Date by and among Sable, EM, as lender, and Alter Domus Products Corp., as the administrative agent for the benefit of the lender requires that James C.

In accordance with the terms of the First Amendment, the Additional Principal shall be deemed to have accrued interest as if such amount has been added to the outstanding principal amount of the Senior Secured Term Loan, on January 1, 2024 (the "Amendment Effective Date"). The Additional Principal and million associated paid-in-kind interest accrued for the period from the Amendment Effective Date through the Amendment Closing Date (collectively, the "Effective Additional Principal") was added to the outstanding principal amount of the Senior Secured Term Loan on the Amendment Closing Date and was accounted for as an exit cost under the scope of ASC 420. As a result, the Effective Additional Principal is included within Other expense on the Company's unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations for the three months ended September 30, 2024 (Successor) and for the period from February 14, 2024 through September 30, 2024 (Successor).

Issued Transferred ) Exercised ) ) Outstanding Warrants at September 30, 2024 
 
 Public Warrants 
 
 Public Warrants may only be exercised for a whole number of shares. No fractional shares will be issued upon exercise of the Public Warrants. The Public Warrants became exercisable days after the completion of the Business Combination and will expire from the Closing Date, at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, or earlier upon redemption or liquidation. 
 
 The Company will not be obligated to deliver any shares of Common Stock pursuant to the exercise of a Public Warrant and will have no obligation to settle such Public Warrant exercise unless a registration statement under the Securities Act with respect to the shares of Common Stock underlying the warrants is then effective and a prospectus relating thereto is current, subject to the Company satisfying its obligations with respect to registration, or a valid exemption from registration is available. No warrant will be exercisable, and the Company will not be obligated to issue a share of Common Stock upon exercise of a warrant unless the share of Common Stock issuable upon such warrant exercise has been registered, qualified or deemed to be exempt under the securities laws of the state of residence of the registered holder of the warrants. 
 
 On the Closing Date, the Company filed with the SEC a registration statement for the registration, under the Securities Act, of the shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants, which the SEC declared effective on May 10, 2024. The Company will use its commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement, and a current prospectus relating thereto, until the expiration or redemption of the warrants in accordance with the provisions of the warrant agreement. In addition, if the shares of Common Stock are at the time of any exercise of a warrant not listed on a national securities exchange such that they satisfy the definition of a covered security under Section 18(b)(1) of the Securities Act, the Company may, at its option, require holders of the Public Warrants who exercise their warrants to do so on a cashless basis in accordance with Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act and, in the event the Company elects to do so, the Company will not be required to file or maintain in effect a registration statement, but it will use its best efforts to register or qualify the shares under applicable blue sky laws to the extent an exemption is not available. In such event, each holder would pay the exercise price by surrendering the warrants for that number of shares of Common Stock equal to the lesser of (A) the quotient obtained by dividing (x) the product of the number of shares of Common Stock underlying the warrants, multiplied the excess of the fair market value less the exercise price of the warrants by (y) the fair market value and (B) . The fair market value shall mean the volume weighted average price of the shares of Common Stock for the trading days ending on the trading day prior to the date on which the notice of exercise is received by the warrant agent.

 per Public Warrant; 
 upon not less than days prior written notice of redemption to each warrant holder; and 
 if, and only if, the last sale price of our Common Stock equals or exceeds per share (as adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like) for any trading days within a -trading day period ending on the third trading day prior to the date on which the Company sends the notice of redemption to the warrant holders. 
 
 The Company may exercise its redemption right even if it is unable to register or qualify the underlying securities for sale under all applicable state securities laws. However, the Company will not redeem the warrants unless an effective registration statement under the Securities Act covering the shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants is effective and a current prospectus relating to those shares of Common Stock is available throughout the -day redemption period, except if the warrants are exercised on a cashless basis and such cashless exercise is exempt from registration under the Securities Act. 
 
 Redemption of Warrants For Shares of Common Stock commencing days after the warrants became exercisable, the Company may redeem the outstanding warrants for shares of Common Stock: 
 
 in whole and not in part; 
 at a price equal to a number of shares of Common Stock to be determined by reference to the agreed table set forth in the warrant agreement based on the redemption date and the fair market value of the Common Stock; 
 upon not less than days prior written notice of redemption to each warrant holder; and 
 if, and only if, the last sale price of our Common Stock equals or exceeds per share (as adjusted per share splits, share dividends, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like) on the trading day prior to the date on which the Company sends the notice of redemption to the warrant holders. 
 
 The exercise price and number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the Public Warrants may be adjusted in certain circumstances including in the event of a share dividend, extraordinary dividend or recapitalization, reorganization, merger or consolidation. However, except as described below, the Public Warrants will not be adjusted for issuances of shares of Common Stock at a price below its exercise price. Additionally, in no event will the Company be required to net cash settle the Public Warrants upon exercise. 
 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, warrant holders exercised Warrants for shares of Common Stock resulting in approximately million in cash proceeds to the Company. Public Warrants may only be exercised for a whole number of shares. The exercised warrants were previously accounted for as a derivative liability and carried on our balance sheets at fair value prior to exercise. Upon exercise, the fair value of the derivative liability was reclassified to stockholders' equity in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity ASC Topic 480 ). 
 
 On October 3, 2024, the conditions under which the Warrants could be redeemed by the Company for shares of Common Stock were satisfied and the Company announced that it would redeem all of the outstanding Public Warrants that remain outstanding after 5:00 p.m. New York City time on November 4, 2024, for a redemption price of per warrant (the "Redemption"). Warrants that were issued under the Warrant Agreement in a private placement and held by the founders of the Company were not subject to the Redemption. 
 
 Private Placement Warrants and Working Capital Warrants 
 
 The Private Placement Warrants and Working Capital Warrants are identical to the Public Warrants issued in connection with Flame's IPO, except that (x) the Private Placement Warrants, the Working Capital Warrants, and the shares of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of such warrants were not transferable, assignable or salable until days after the Closing Date, subject to certain limited exceptions, (y) the Private Placement Warrants and Working Capital Warrants are exercisable on a cashless basis and non-redeemable so long as they are held by the initial purchasers or their permitted transferees and (z) the Private Placement Warrants, the Working Capital Warrants, and the shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such warrants are entitled to registration rights. If the Private Placement Warrants or Working Capital Warrants are held by someone other than the initial purchasers or their permitted transferees, such warrants will be redeemable by the Company and exercisable by such holders on the same basis as the Public Warrants.

The Company expensed million upon the effectiveness of the Settlement Agreement, which is included in General and administrative expenses on the unaudited condensed consolidated statement of operations for the period from February 14, 2024 through September 30, 2024 (Successor). Following the effectiveness of the Settlement Agreement, all Interest Payable has been fully offset by the ordinary and customary expenses charged to the Company from JPMorgan as the issuer of the Letter of Credit, resulting in expense for three months ended September 30, 2024 (refer to discussion of restricted cash in Note 2 Significant Accounting Policies for additional details regarding the Interest Payable and the Letter of Credit).

 Incentive Plan 
 
 The Company's Incentive Plan includes incentive stock options and nonqualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, dividend equivalents, restricted stock units and other stock or cash-based awards. Certain awards under the Incentive Plan may constitute or provide for payment of nonqualified deferred compensation under Section 409A of the Code, which may impose additional requirements on the terms and conditions of such awards. Awards other than cash awards generally will be settled in shares of the Company's Common Stock, but the applicable award agreement may provide for cash settlement of any award. 
 
 Our employees, consultants and directors, and employees and consultants of our subsidiaries, may be eligible to receive awards under the Incentive Plan. Following the closing of the Business Combination, the Compensation Committee of the Company's Board of Directors (the "Board") was appointed by the Board to administer the Incentive Plan (the Compensation Committee, in its role as administrator of the Incentive Plan, the "Plan Administrator"). 
 
 The Plan Administrator has the authority to take all actions and make all determinations under the Incentive Plan, to interpret the Incentive Plan and award agreements and to adopt, amend and repeal rules for the administration of the Incentive Plan as it deems advisable. The Plan Administrator will also have the authority to, among other things, determine which eligible service providers receive awards, grant awards, set the terms and conditions of all awards under the Incentive Plan, including any performance goals, vesting and vesting acceleration provisions, subject to the conditions and limitations in the Incentive Plan, accelerate vesting requirements, waive or amend performance goals and other restrictions, and amend award agreements. 
 
 Restricted Stock Awards 
 
 On the Closing Date, and in connection with the executive officers' employment agreements, the Company granted shares of restricted Common Stock to each of the Company's executive officers (other than Mr. Flores), which vest on the earlier of (i) the restart of production from the SYU Assets or (ii) after the Closing Date. The executive officer awards are subject to a lock-up provision. 
 
 During March 2024, the Plan Administrator authorized the grant of shares of restricted Common Stock in the aggregate to the members of the Board for their contributions towards closing the Business Combination and for their service on the Board. These restricted shares vest months from the grant date. 
 
 Additionally, shares of restricted Common Stock were granted to employees of the Company following the closing of the Business Combination through September 30, 2024. These restricted shares vest on the earlier of (i) the restart of production from the SYU Assets or (ii) after the Closing Date. All of the executive officer awards, the awards granted to the members of the Board, and the awards granted to employees of the Company following the closing of the Business Combination are restricted stock awards to be settled in shares, and qualify as equity classified awards. The value of the stock-settled restricted stock awards is established by the market price on the date of grant and is recorded as compensation expense ratably over the vesting terms. Forfeitures will be recognized as they occur.

 The unrecognized stock-based compensation expense associated with the unvested restricted stock awards at September 30, 2024 (Successor) was million, which is to be recognized over the weighted average remaining life of approximately . 
 
 Merger Consideration 
 
 Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, on the Closing Date and contemporaneously with the completion of the transactions contemplated under the Sable-EM Purchase Agreement, as previously noted Holdco merged with and into Flame, with Flame as the surviving company, and immediately thereafter, Sable merged with and into Flame, with Flame as the surviving company. The aggregate consideration received by holders of limited liability company membership interests in Holdco designated as Class A shares immediately prior to the Holdco Merger Effective Time was shares of Flame Class A Common Stock. Share-based compensation expense of million was recognized associated with the issuance of the shares in General and administrative expenses on the unaudited condensed consolidated statement of operations for the period from February 14, 2024 through September 30, 2024 (Successor). The Merger Consideration Shares are subject to a lock-up provision. 
 
 Founders Shares 
 
 Founder Shares to some of the Company s directors and executives, including Gregory D. Patrinely, the Company s Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, at their original purchase price. Such sale of Founder Shares to the Company s directors and executives is within the scope of FASB ASC Topic 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation ASC 718 ). Under ASC 718, stock-based compensation associated with equity-classified awards is measured at fair value upon the grant date. The Founder Shares were sold to directors and executives and effectively transferred subject to a performance condition (i.e., the consummation of a Business Combination). Compensation expense related to the Founder Shares is recognized only when the performance condition is probable of achievement under the applicable accounting literature. As such, the Company recognized million in stock-based compensation expense upon the completion of the Business Combination, which is included in the General and administrative expenses on the unaudited condensed consolidated statement of operations for the period from February 14, 2024 through September 30, 2024 (Successor).

 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, Private Placement Warrants ceased to be held by the initial purchasers or their permitted transferees and therefore became redeemable by the Company and exercisable by the holders of such warrants on the same basis as the Public Warrants. As a result, million was transferred out of Level 3 and into Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy during the three months ended September 30, 2024 (Successor) and the period February 14, 2024 through September 30, 2024 (Successor). There were no other transfers in or out of Level 2 or Level 3 from other levels in the fair value hierarchy during the three months ended September 30, 2024 (Successor) or the period from February 14, 2024 through September 30, 2024 (Successor).

 As of September 30, 2024 (Successor), the estimated fair value of the Senior Secured Term Loan approximates the amount of principal and paid-in-kind interest outstanding because the interest rate is reflective of market rates and such outstanding amount may be repaid, in full or in part, at any time without penalty.

Overview 
 
 Sable Offshore Corp. is an independent oil and gas company headquartered in Houston, Texas. We were incorporated in Delaware on October 16, 2020 and, until February 14, 2024, were a blank check company formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses. We are an emerging growth company and, as such, we are subject to all of the risks associated with emerging growth companies.

Table of Contents 

 On February 12, 2024, Flame held a special meeting of stockholders (the Special Meeting ), at which the Flame stockholders considered and adopted, among other matters, a proposal to approve the Business Combination, including (a) adopting the Merger Agreement and (b) approving the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. 
 
 Pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, following the Special Meeting, on February 14, 2024 (the Closing Date ), the Business Combination was consummated (the Closing ). In connection with the Business Combination, Flame changed its name to Sable Offshore Corp. 

First PIPE Investment 
 
 On February 14, 2024, in connection with the Busienss Combination, the Company issued 44,024,910 shares of Common Stock, at a price of 10.00 per share for aggregate gross proceeds of 440.2 million (the "First PIPE Investment"). The shares of Common Stock issued in the First PIPE Investment were offered in a private placement under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ). Upon the closing of the Business Combination, an associated marketing fee of 10.1 million was paid in full, and is recognized as an offset to the proceeds from the First PIPE Investment. 
 
 Second PIPE Investment 
 
 On September 26, 2024, the Company issued 7,500,000 shares of Common Stock of the Company, at a price of 20.00 per share for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately 150.0 million (the "Second PIPE Investment"). The shares of Common Stock issued in the Second PIPE Investment were offered in a private placement under the Securities Act. Upon the closing of the Second PIPE Investment, an associated marketing fee and legal fees of approximately 7.5 million was accrued in full, and was recognized as an offset to the proceeds from the Second PIPE Investment. 

SYU 
 
 Beginning in 1968 and over the course of 14 years, EM consolidated more than a dozen offshore federal oil leases and organized them into a streamlined production unit known as SYU. SYU consists of three offshore platforms and a wholly owned onshore processing facility located along the Gaviota Coast at Las Flores Canyon in Santa Barbara County, California. SYU s onshore facilities and the three offshore platforms remained in continuous operation until 2015. In May 2015, a pipeline operated by Plains All American Pipeline, L.P. Plains that transported produced oil from SYU experienced a leak, as further described in the section of the Form 10-K titled Business Pipeline 901 Incident. The SYU platforms and facilities suspended production after the incident, the SYU Assets were shut in and the facilities were placed in a safe state. The facilities are not currently producing oil and gas; however, all equipment remains in place in an operation-ready state, requiring ongoing inspections, maintenance and surveillance. As part of these suspension efforts, all SYU equipment was drained, flushed and purged in 2016. All hydrocarbon pipelines within SYU have been placed in a safe state and remain under regular monitoring. In 2020, Plains entered into a Consent Decree, described further in the section of the Form 10-K titled Business Pipeline 901 Incident, that provides a path for a potential restart of the Pipelines. 
 
 The discussion of the results of operations for the Predecessor periods below do not include the results from the Pipelines and the Pipelines are not included in the combined financial statements of the Predecessor included in the financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report. Financial statements of the Pipelines have not been included because SEC guidance provides that the financial statements of recently acquired businesses such as the Pipelines need not be filed unless their omission would render Predecessors combined financial statements misleading or substantially incomplete. Based upon our quantitative and qualitative analysis, we do not believe omitting the financial statements of the Pipelines renders the Predecessor combined financial statements misleading or substantially incomplete. The Successor financial statements include the results from the Pipelines and the Pipelines are included in the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 
 For the purposes of the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, periods on or before February 13, 2024 reflect the financial position, results of operations and cash flows of SYU prior to the Business Combination, referred to herein as the Predecessor, and periods beginning on or after February 14, 2024 reflect the financial position, results of operations and cash flows of the Company as a result of the Business Combination, referred to herein as the Successor .

 Recent Events 
 
 On June 27, 2024, the Center for Biological Diversity and the Wishtoyo Foundation filed a complaint against Debra Haaland, Secretary of the U.S. Department of the Interior; the Bureau of Environmental Safety and Enforcement BSEE and Bruce Hesson, BSEE Pacific Regional Director in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California (Case No. 2:24-cv-05459). In the complaint, plaintiffs allege that BSEE violated the National Environmental Policy Act NEPA ), the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act OCSLA ), and the Administrative Procedure Act in November 2023 by approving an extension to resume operations associated with 16 oil and gas leases Sable holds in the Santa Ynez Unit in federal waters offshore of California in the Santa Barbara Channel. The complaint asks for the Court to issue an order finding that BSEE violated NEPA and OCSLA by approving the extension, to vacate and remand the extension to BSEE, to prohibit BSEE from authorizing further extensions until it complies with NEPA and OCSLA, and for an award of costs and attorneys fees. Although not named as a party to the case, Sable has moved to intervene to become a party to the lawsuit and to vigorously contest the plaintiffs allegations. Separately, BSEE has confirmed that Sable s recent completion of lease-holding activities serves to maintain all 16 leases within the Santa Ynez Unit to October 9, 2025. 
 
 In a letter dated July 10, 2024, the California Office of the State Fire Marshal OSFM re-affirmed that Pacific Pipeline Company s PPC April 2021 Risk Analysis and Implementation Plan (the 2021 Plan remains in effect and complies with California State Assembly Bill 864. PPC had filed a supplemental Revised Risk Analysis and Implementation Plan (the Supplemental Plan after the County of Santa Barbara denied permits requested to comply with the 2021 Plan. While OSFM acknowledged PPC s efforts to reduce spill response times and releases, it determined that the Supplemental Plan is not considered as effective in mitigating potential environmental impacts compared to the 2021 Plan. Consequently, the 2021 Plan, which uses the best available technology, remains in effect. 
 
 On July 29, 2024, PPC submitted restart plans for the Pipelines (the Restart Plans to the OSFM as required by the Consent Decree. PPC is required to submit the Restart Plans to the OSFM for approval at least sixty (60) days prior to returning the Pipelines to service. 
 
 On July 31, 2024, the OSFM approved an extension request previously submitted by PPC, setting a new deadline for implementation of the approved 2021 Plan to July 1, 2025. 
 
 On July 30, 2024, the County of Santa Barbara (the "County") determined Sable s applications for the Change of Owner, Change of Operator, and Guarantor of the SYU, Pacific Offshore Pipeline Company Gas Plant, and the Pipelines were complete. 
 
 On August 30, 2024, the County acknowledged that it does not have jurisdiction over PPC s installation of sixteen new safety valves in the County along the Pipelines in accordance with Assembly Bill 864. The County's acknowledgement was delivered in the form of a conditional settlement agreement dated August 30, 2024 (the "Safety Valve Settlement Agreement"), among the County, PPC and the Company, and a subsequent acknowledgement by the County s planning and development staff. 
 
 Pursuant to the Safety Valve Settlement Agreement, PPC agreed to the following additional surveillance and 
 response enhancements in the County: 
 
 i. PPC will create a Santa Barbara County-based Surveillance and Response Team, trained in PPC s Tactical Response Plan, which will be responsible for timely initial incident response and equipped with key resources to deploy in early containment, particularly for those regions of the Pipeline between Gaviota and Las Flores Canyon; 
 ii. PPC will provide Santa Barbara first responders with additional training and equipment to assist in PPC s incident response efforts; and 
 iii. PPC will undertake the following Pipeline system enhancements: (1) install and operate and maintain primary and secondary Operations Control Centers in Santa Barbara County, and (2) refurbish the Gaviota pump in its existing station. 
 
 PPC, the Company and the County have further agreed, in the Safety Valve Settlement Agreement, to file a stipulation to dismiss the pending lawsuit, Pacific Pipeline Company and Sable Of shore Corp. v. Santa Barbara County Planning Commission and Board of Supervisors (Case No. 2:23-cv-09218-DMG-MRW) within 15 days of final installation of all sixteen underground safety valves in the County.

 On September 27, 2024, the California Coastal Commission (the Coastal Commission notified the Company that it believed that the Company s maintenance and repair activities on the Pipelines in the Coastal Zone may constitute unpermitted development activities under the California Coastal Act (Cal. Pub. Res. Code Section 30000, et seq.) (the Coastal Act ). Maintenance and repair activities that are exempt from additional Coastal Act permitting requirements have been conducted on the Las Flores Pipeline system under the pipeline s existing coastal development permits for the last 35+ years, and the Company believes the recent work is within the scope of those historic activities. Following good faith negotiations with Coastal Commission staff, on November 12, 2024 the Company received an Executive Director Cease and Desist Order from the Coastal Commission requiring the filling and closing of open sites within the Coastal Zone without completion of pipeline repairs at those sites. The Coastal Commission and the Company are now working towards an interim work plan to allow for the restoration of the excavations. The Company and the Coastal Commission agree that this work will protect the environment against concerns regarding erosion or other damage that could occur in case of inclement weather. Once the Coastal Commission approves the Company s interim work plan, the Company expects to commence work immediately and expects the work will take approximately seven days to complete. This work will allow the Coastal Commission to complete their analysis and for the Coastal Commission and the Company to progress their discussions regarding how to proceed with the remaining pipeline maintenance and repair work in the Coastal Zone. The Company continues to actively engage with Coastal Commission staff in an attempt to agree on a consensual path forward for the remaining maintenance and repair activities in the Coastal Zone. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, warrant holders had exercised 6,315,977 Warrants for approximately 72.5 million in cash proceeds.

Components of Results of Operations 
 
 Revenue 
 
 The Company has not had any substantial revenues since the shut-in. The Company s various operating expenses are the principal metrics used to assess its performance. 
 
 Operating Expenses 
 
 Operations and maintenance . The Company s most significant costs to operate and maintain its assets are direct labor and supervision, power, repair and maintenance expenses, and equipment rentals. Fluctuations in commodity prices impact operating cost elements both directly and indirectly. For example, commodity prices directly impact costs such as power and fuel, which are expenses that increase (or decrease) in line with changes in commodity prices. Commodity prices also affect industry activity and demand, thus indirectly impacting the cost of items such as labor and equipment rentals. 
 
 Depreciation, depletion, amortization, and accretion . Depreciation, depletion and amortization are primarily determined under either the unit-of-production method or the straight-line method, which is based on estimated asset service life taking obsolescence into consideration. Since being shut in, no depletion or amortization has been recorded for the Successor periods presented. An immaterial amount of depreciation was reflected for idle

 plants in the historical Predecessor financial statements. Also included in the Successor and Predecessor financial statements is the accretion associated with the Company's estimated asset retirement obligations ARO ). The ARO liabilities are initially recorded at their fair value and then are accreted using the Company s applicable discount rate over the period for the change in their present value until the estimated retirement of the asset. 
 
 General and administrative . General and administrative G A costs are comprised of overhead expenditures directly and indirectly associated with operating the assets. These support services include information technology, risk management, corporate planning, accounting, cash management, human resources, and other general corporate services. General and administrative expenses that were not specifically identifiable to SYU were allocated to SYU for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2023 and for the period from January 1, 2024 to February 13, 2024. To calculate a reasonable allocation, aggregated historical benchmarking data from comparable companies with similar operated upstream assets was used to identify general and administrative expenses as a proportion of operating expenses. SYU may also require increased services in the future, commensurate with planned activity levels. 
 
 Taxes other than income . Management anticipates future increases in ad valorem taxes, in line with the projected restart of production. 

Results of Operations 
 
 The comparability of our operating results for the three months ended September 30, 2024 (Successor), the period February 14, 2024 through September 30, 2024 (Successor), the period January 1, 2024 through February 13, 2024 (Predecessor), and the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 (Predecessor) was impacted by the Business Combination. In the discussion of our results of operations for these periods, we may quantitatively disclose the impacts of the Business Combination to the extent they remain ascertainable. The entirety of our activity since inception through the Closing Date were related to our formation, the preparation for our initial public offering, and since the closing of our initial public offering, the search for a target for our initial business combination (Refer to Note 1 Organization, Business Operations, and Going Concern ). Following the Closing Date, all of our operations have focused on restarting production of the SYU Assets. We lack the ability to generate any operating revenues until we receive the necessary regulatory approvals and complete the repairs necessary to restart production. Our only source of non-operating income is generated in the form of interest income on cash and cash equivalents. Post the Business Combination, we expect to incur additional expenses as a result of being an operating public company, for legal, accounting and compliance expenses.

 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 vs. Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 
 The following table presents selected consolidated financial results of operations for the Successor and Predecessor periods presented. 
 Successor Predecessor Increase (Decrease) (in thousands) Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 Revenue Oil and gas sales Operating Expenses Operations and maintenance expenses 25,629 14,258 11,371 79.8 Depletion, depreciation, amortization and accretion 2,755 5,255 (2,500) (47.6) General and administrative expenses 26,225 3,022 23,203 nm Total operating expenses 54,609 22,535 32,074 Loss from operations (54,609) (22,535) (32,074) 142.3 Other expenses: Change in fair value of warrant liabilities 178,199 178,199 nm Other expense 2,728 535 2,193 nm Interest expense 19,169 19,169 nm Total other expense, net 200,096 535 199,561 Loss before income taxes (254,705) (23,070) (231,635) 1004.1 Income tax expense 865 865 Net loss (255,570) (23,070) (232,500) 1007.8 nm: not meaningful 

Operating and maintenance expenses. Operating and maintenance expenses were 25.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 (Successor), representing an increase of 11.4 million, or 79.8 , compared to 14.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 (Predecessor). The increase in operating and maintenance expenses was primarily attributable to timing of maintenance expenses incurred in connection with restart efforts. Operations and maintenance expenses are expected to increase over the next several years as production is restarted. 
 
 Depletion, depreciation, amortization and accretion. Depletion, depreciation, amortization and accretion was 2.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 (Successor), representing a decrease of 2.5 million, or 47.6 , compared to 5.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 (Predecessor). The decrease in depletion, depreciation, amortization and accretion was primarily attributable to the Company not recognizing depreciation expense following the Business Combination, as the Company determined the assets were not in service since repairs are necessary prior to achieving production restart. The depletion, depreciation, amortization and accretion expense recognized for the three months ended September 30, 2024 (Successor) solely represents the recognition of ARO accretion for the period but depreciation will resume once the assets are placed in service. Depletion, depreciation, amortization and accretion expense is expected to increase over the next several years as production is restarted. 
 
 General and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses ("G A expenses") were 26.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 (Successor), representing an increase of 23.2 million compared to 3.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 (Predecessor). The increase in G A expenses was primarily attributable to the 15.0 million in share-based compensation expense and the recognition of salaries and wages following the Business Combination. Predecessor G A expenses were allocated to SYU as a portion of certain other operating costs based on aggregated historical benchmarking data, as previously noted. 
 
 Total other expense, net. Total other expense, net was 200.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 (Successor), representing an increase of 199.6 million compared to other expense of 0.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 (Predecessor). The increase in total other expense, net was primarily attributable to an increase of 178.2 million in the fair value of the warrants, 19.2 million in interest expense and 5.0 million of other expense related to the First Amendment to the Senior Secured Term Loan (Refer to Note 6 Debt for additional details regarding 
 32 

Table of Contents 

 the First Amendment to the Senior Secured Term Loan), partially offset by interest income. The increase during the Successor period is due to the fact that the Predecessor did not have any debt or associated interest expense, warrants, or interest income. 
 
 Income tax expense. Income tax expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 (Successor) was 0.9 million, representing an increase of 0.9 million compared to zero income tax expense for the three months ended September 30, 2023 (Predecessor). Based on our ongoing assessment of our ability to recover our deferred tax assets, we concluded that it was more likely than not that our deferred tax assets in excess of deferred tax liabilities would not be realized. For the Successor period, we concluded that certain deferred tax liabilities in future periods do not have deferred tax assets available to offset, which is primarily due to our net operating losses being limited to 80 of taxable income. Therefore, a further valuation allowance of our deferred tax assets is necessary, which results in deferred tax expense for the Successor period. Our judgment regarding the likelihood of realization of these deferred tax assets could change in future periods, which could result in a material impact to our income tax provision in the period of change. 
 
 Comparison of the periods from January 1, 2024 through February 13, 2024 (Predecessor) and February 14, 2024 through September 30, 2024 (Successor) to the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 (Predecessor). 
 
 The following table presents selected consolidated financial results of operations for the Successor and Predecessor periods presented.

Operating and maintenance expenses. Operating and maintenance expenses were 7.3 million and 59.2 million for the periods from January 1, 2024 through February 13, 2024 (Predecessor) and February 14, 2024 through September 30, 2024 (Successor), respectively, or a combined 66.6 million, representing an increase of 23.4 million, or 54.2 , compared to 43.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 (Predecessor). The increase in operating and maintenance expenses was primarily attributable to timing of maintenance expenses incurred in connection with restart efforts. Operations and maintenance expenses are expected to increase over the next several years as production is restarted. 
 
 Depletion, depreciation, amortization and accretion. Depletion, depreciation, amortization and accretion was 2.6 million and 6.9 million for the periods from January 1, 2024 through February 13, 2024 (Predecessor) and February 14, 2024 through September 30, 2024 (Successor), respectively, or a combined 9.5 million, representing a decrease of 6.3 million,

 or 39.8 , compared to 15.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 (Predecessor). The decrease in depletion, depreciation, amortization and accretion was primarily attributable to the Company not recognizing depreciation expense following the Business Combination, as the Company determined the assets were not in service since repairs are necessary prior to achieving production restart. Depreciation will resume once the assets are placed in service. The 6.9 million depletion, depreciation, amortization and accretion expense recognized for the period February 14, 2024 through September 30, 2024 (Successor) solely represents the recognition of ARO accretion for the period. Depletion, depreciation, amortization and accretion expense is expected to increase over the next several years as production is restarted. 
 
 General and administrative expenses. G A expenses were 1.7 million and 209.9 million for the periods from January 1, 2024 through February 13, 2024 (Predecessor) and February 14, 2024 through September 30, 2024 (Successor), respectively, or a combined 211.6 million, representing an increase of 202.5 million compared to 9.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 (Predecessor). The increase in G A expenses was primarily attributable to the 70.0 million settlement of the Grey Fox Matter (Refer to Note 8 Commitments and Contingencies ), 82.3 million in share-based compensation expense following the Business Combination, 16.8 million in legal expenses and professional fees related to the Business Combination, and the recognition of salaries and wages following the Company's commencement of operations following the Business Combination. Predecessor G A expenses were allocated to SYU as a portion of certain other operating costs based on aggregated historical benchmarking data as previously noted. 
 
 Total other expense, net. Total other expense, net was 0.1 million and 305.7 million for the periods from January 1, 2024 through February 13, 2024 (Predecessor) and February 14, 2024 through September 30, 2024 (Successor), respectively, or a combined 305.8 million, representing an increase of 305.3 million compared to 0.5 million in other expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 (Predecessor). The increase in total other expense, net was primarily attributable to an increase of 257.6 million in fair value of the warrants and 48.1 million in interest expense, partially offset by interest income. The increase during the Successor period is also due to the fact that the Predecessor did not have any debt or associated interest expense, warrants, or interest income. 
 
 Income tax expense. Income tax expense was zero and 19.4 million for the periods from January 1, 2024 through February 13, 2024 (Predecessor) and February 14, 2024 through September 30, 2024 (Successor), respectively, representing an increase of 19.4 million compared to zero for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 (Predecessor). Based on our ongoing assessment of our ability to recover our deferred tax assets, we concluded that it was more likely than not that our deferred tax assets in excess of deferred tax liabilities would not be realized. For the Successor period, we concluded that certain deferred tax liabilities in future periods do not have deferred tax assets available to offset, which is primarily due to our net operating losses being limited to 80 of taxable income. Therefore, a further valuation allowance of our deferred tax assets is necessary, which results in deferred tax expense for the Successor period. Our judgment regarding the likelihood of realization of these deferred tax assets could change in future periods, which could result in a material impact to our income tax provision in the period of change. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 Overview. Our plans for restarting production, including restarting the existing wells and facilities and recommencing transportation through the Pipelines, will require significant capital expenditures in excess of current operational cash flow. Historically, SYU s primary source of liquidity has been its operational cash flow and, since the shut-in, capital contributions from its parent. While SYU s production is in the process of being restarted and prior to generating positive cash flow from production, SYU s capital expenditure needs will be substantial and are expected to come from cash on hand. Prior to the Business Combination, Flame had approximately 62.2 million in its trust account, which consisted of proceeds from the public stockholders and the private placement investors in connection with the Company s initial public offering, less redemptions. Sable raised 440.2 million in gross proceeds from the First PIPE Investment in connection with the Business Combination, 150.0 million in gross proceeds from the Second PIPE Investment, and approximately 72.5 million from the exercise of 6,315,977 warrants for 6,315,977 shares of Common Stock in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Additionally, more than 600 million of the Purchase Price was seller-financed through a secured Senior Secured Term Loan with EM (the Senior Secured Term Loan ). Based on its current financial plan, Sable management expects production to restart in the fourth quarter 2024, after which its operating cash flows are expected to be sufficient to service Sable s indebtedness. 
 
 Capital Requirements. Sable currently estimates start-up expenses of approximately 197.0 million in order to restart production in the fourth quarter 2024. Management evaluates its cost estimates on an ongoing basis. The expenditures will primarily be directed toward obtaining the necessary regulatory approvals and completing the pipeline repairs and bringing the shut-in assets back online in the fourth quarter 2024. After production restarts, Sable management expects a rapid 
 34 

Table of Contents 

 increase in operating cash flows that should allow Sable to fund further capital expenditures. If Sable is unable to obtain funds or provide funds as needed for the planned capital expenditure program, Sable may not be able to finance the capital expenditures necessary to restart production or sustain production thereafter. 

Going Concern 
 
 Prior to the Business Combination, EM funded the Predecessor SYU operational expenses. Since the consummation of the Business Combination, Sable has addressed near-term capital funding needs with the First PIPE Investment, the Second PIPE Investment and proceeds from the exercise of Warrants (refer to Note 7 Warrants for additional details regarding the warrant exercises) and believes the Company has sufficient capital to maintain operations and complete the repairs necessary to restart production at SYU. However, the Company s plans for production restart are contingent upon approvals from federal, state and local regulators. Additionally, if the Company s estimates of the costs of restarting production are less than the actual amounts necessary to do so, the Company may have insufficient funds available to operate its business prior to first production and will need to raise additional capital. If the Company is unable to raise additional capital, it may be required to take additional measures to conserve liquidity, which could include, among other things, reducing overhead expenses. The Company cannot provide any assurance that new financing will be available to it on commercially acceptable terms, if at all. 
 
 Due to the remaining regulatory approvals necessary to restart production, along with the timing of ongoing construction repair efforts, substantial doubt exists about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements included in this Quarterly Report do not include any adjustments relating to the recovery of the recorded assets or the classification of the liabilities that could be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern. 

Cash Flows 
 
 The following table summarizes cash flows from Operating, Investing and Financing activities: 
 
 Successor Predecessor (Decrease) Increase (dollars in thousands) February 14, 2024 September 30, 2024 January 1, 2024 February 13, 2024 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 Cash flows (used in) provided by: Operating activities (125,509) (22,474) (54,617) (93,366) 170.9 Investing activities (222,728) (222,728) Financing activities 618,387 22,474 54,617 586,244 1,073 Net change in cash and cash equivalents 270,150 270,150 
 
 Cash Flows from Operating Activities. SYU has been shut in since 2015 and therefore SYU had no production and associated revenues for the comparative periods. The net cash used in operating activities for the Company was 22.5 million and 125.5 million for the periods from January 1, 2024 through February 13, 2024 (Predecessor) and February 14, 2024 through September 30, 2024 (Successor), respectively, or a combined 148.0 million, representing an increase of 93.4 million, or 170.9 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 (Predecessor). The primary use of cash can be attributed to maintenance and operational readiness activities for SYU in the Predecessor and Successor periods, with additional general and administrative costs incurred post the Business Combination in the Successor period. For the period from February 14, 2024 through September 30, 2024 (Successor), we had a net loss of 601.1 million, partially offset by a non-cash increase of 257.6 million in fair value of the warrants, non-cash stock-based compensation of 86.0 million, changes in accounts payable of 54.5 million, non-cash paid-in-kind interest 47.3 million, non-cash deferred tax expense of 19.4 million, and a non-cash effect from the First Amendment to the Senior Secured Term Loan of 5.0 million. Changes in accounts payable for that period is primarily attributable to the Grey Fox Matter settlement, with 35.0 million remaining in Accounts payable and accrued expenses as of September 30, 2024 (Refer to Note 2 Significant Accounting Policies), approximately 7.5 million in marketing and legal fees associated with the Second PIPE Investment, and other vendor payables associated with the SYU restart. Future cash flow from operations for SYU will depend on our ability to bring the associated oil and gas production of the assets back online, as well as the prices of oil, NGLs and natural gas.

Contractual Obligations 
 
 Pursuant to the Senior Secured Term Loan, which financed most of the Purchase Price (as defined in the Senior Secured Term Loan), Sable will pay interest at ten percent (10 per annum compounded annually, payable in arrears on January 1st of each year. At Sable s election, accrued but unpaid interest may be deemed paid on each interest payment date by adding the amount of interest owed to the outstanding principal (paid-in-kind) amount under the Senior Secured Term Loan. Refer to Note 6 Debt for additional disclosures regarding the Senior Secured Term Loan. 
 
 Pursuant to the Transition Services Agreement with EM, EM provided to Sable certain operational, accounting, cash management, information technology and other general transition services with respect to the Assets (as such term is defined in the Sable-EM Purchase Agreement) for three months following the Closing Date, or until May 14, 2024. 
 
 Additional obligations include the performance of ARO as referenced under Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Asset Retirement Obligations below. 
 
 Off Balance Sheet Arrangements

 The preparation of combined financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the combined financial statements, and income and expenses during the periods reported. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates. 
 
 Property, Plant and Equipment. 
 
 Cost Basis . Oil and gas producing activities are accounted for under the successful efforts method of accounting. Under this method, costs are accumulated on a field-by-field basis. Costs incurred to purchase, lease, or otherwise acquire a property (whether unproved or proved) are capitalized when incurred. Exploratory well costs are carried as an asset when 
 36 

Table of Contents 

 the well has found a sufficient quantity of resources to justify its completion as a producing well and where sufficient progress assessing the resources and the economic and operating viability of the project is being made. Exploratory well costs not meeting these criteria are charged to expense. Other exploratory expenditures, including geophysical costs and annual lease rentals, are expensed as incurred. Development costs, including costs of productive wells and development dry holes, are capitalized. 
 
 Other Property and Equipment . Other property and equipment primarily consist of onshore midstream facilities. Due to the nature of the other property and equipment, it is presented with oil and gas properties in the combined financial statements. 
 
 Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization . Depreciation, depletion and amortization are primarily determined under the unit-of-production method, which is based on estimated asset service life taking obsolescence into consideration. 
 
 Acquisition costs of proved properties are amortized using a unit-of-production method, computed on the basis of total proved oil and natural gas reserve volumes. Capitalized exploratory drilling and development costs associated with productive depletable extractive properties are amortized using the unit-of-production rates based on the amount of proved developed resources of oil and gas that are estimated to be recoverable from existing facilities using current operating methods. Under the unit-of-production method, oil and natural gas volumes are considered produced once they have been measured through meters at custody transfer or sales transaction points at the outlet valve on the lease or field storage tank. Maintenance and repairs, including planned major maintenance, are expensed as incurred. Major renewals and improvements are capitalized and the assets replaced are retired. 
 
 SYU has been shut in since 2015 due to a pipeline incident but has been maintained by EM to preserve it in an operation-ready state and thus no depletion has been recorded for the periods presented. 
 
 Impairment Assessment. Assets are tested for recoverability on an ongoing basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable. Among the events or changes in circumstances which could indicate that the carrying value of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable are the following: 
 
 a significant decrease in the market price of a long-lived asset; 
 a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is being used or in its physical condition, including a significant decrease in current and projected resource or reserve volumes; 
 a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value, including an adverse action or assessment by a regulator; 
 an accumulation of project costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected; and 
 a current-period operating loss combined with a history and forecast of operating or cash flow losses. 
 
 The SYU assets undergo a process that monitors for indicators of potential impairment throughout the year. This process is aligned with the requirements of ASC 360 Property, Plant, and Equipment and ASC 932 Extractive Activities Oil and Gas. Asset valuation analysis, profitability reviews and other periodic control processes assist in assessing whether events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amounts of any of the assets may not be recoverable. 
 
 If events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable, management estimates the future undiscounted cash flows of the affected properties to judge the recoverability of carrying amounts. In performing this assessment, assets are grouped at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets. Cash flows used in recoverability assessments are based on assumptions which are developed by management and are consistent with the criteria management uses to evaluate investment opportunities. These evaluations make use of assumptions of future capital allocations, crude oil and natural gas commodity prices including price differentials, refining and chemical margins, volumes, and development and operating costs. Volumes are based on projected field and facility production profiles, throughput, or sales. Management s estimate of upstream production volumes used for projected cash flows makes use of proved reserve quantities and may include risk-adjusted unproved reserve quantities. 
 
 An asset group is impaired if its estimated undiscounted cash flows are less than the asset group s carrying value. Impairments are measured by the amount by which the carrying value exceeds fair value. The assessment of fair value is based upon the views of a likely market participant. The principal parameters used to establish fair value include estimates of acreage values and flowing production metrics from comparable market transactions, market-based estimates of historical cash flow multiples, and discounted cash flows. Inputs and assumptions used in discounted cash flow models 
 37 

Table of Contents 

 include estimates of future production volumes, throughput and product sales volumes, commodity prices which are consistent with the average of third-party industry experts and government agencies, refining and chemical margins, drilling and development costs, operating costs and discount rates which are reflective of the characteristics of the asset group. 
 
 Asset Retirement Obligations . The Company s asset retirement obligations primarily relate to the future plugging and abandonment of oil and gas properties and related facilities. The fair values of these obligations are recorded as liabilities on a discounted basis, which is typically at the time the assets are installed. In the estimation of fair value, the Company uses assumptions and judgments regarding such factors as the existence of a legal obligation for an asset retirement obligation, technical assessments of the assets, estimated amounts and timing of settlements, discount rates, and inflation rates. 
 
 Derivative Warrant Liabilities. We do not use derivative instruments to hedge exposures to cash flow, market, or foreign currency risks. We evaluate all of our financial instruments, including issued stock purchase warrants, to determine if such instruments are derivatives or contain features that qualify as embedded derivatives, pursuant to ASC 480 and ASC 815-15. The classification of derivative instruments, including whether such instruments should be recorded as liabilities or as equity, is re-assessed at the end of each reporting period. 
 
 All of our outstanding warrants are recognized as derivative liabilities in accordance with ASC 815-40. Accordingly, we recognize the warrant instruments as liabilities at fair value and adjust the instruments to fair value at each reporting period. The liabilities are subject to re-measurement at each balance sheet date until exercised, and any change in fair value is recognized in our statement of operations. The public warrants are measured at the Observable Quoted Price in Active Markets. The private placement warrants and the working capital warrants are measured at fair value using the Modified Black-Scholes Optional Pricing Model. 
 
 Emerging Growth Company; Smaller Reporting Company 
 
 We are an emerging growth company, as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the JOBS Act, and it has elected to comply with certain reduced public company reporting requirements. Sable could remain an emerging growth company until the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the completion of the Company IPO. However, if (a) Sable s total annual gross revenue exceed 1.235 billion, (b) Sable is deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of Common Stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds 700.0 million as of the end of the prior fiscal year s second fiscal quarter, or (c) Sable s non-convertible debt issued within a three-year period exceeds 1.0 billion, Sable would cease to be an emerging growth company as of the following fiscal year. 
 
 Additionally, we are a smaller reporting company as defined in Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K. Smaller reporting companies may take advantage of certain reduced disclosure obligations, including, among other things, providing only two years of audited financial statements. Sable will be a smaller reporting company until the last day of any fiscal year for so long as either (1) the market value of Common Stock held by non-affiliates did not exceed 250 million as of the prior June 30, or (2) Sable s annual revenues did not exceed 100 million during such completed fiscal year and the market value of Common Stock held by non-affiliates did not exceed 700 million as of the prior June 30. 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
 
 Our management does not believe that any other recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting standards if currently adopted would have a material effect on our financial statements. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 
 We are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information otherwise required under this item.

 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in Company reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 
 As required by Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. Based upon their evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15 (e) and 15d-15 (e) under the Exchange Act) were effective as of September 30, 2024. Accordingly, management believes that the financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q present fairly in all material respects our financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 During the quarter covered by this report there have been no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.
