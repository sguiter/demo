reportable segment: Piping Systems. The Company engineers, manufactures and sells pre-insulated specialty piping systems and leak detection systems. Pre-insulated specialty piping systems include: (i) insulated and jacketed district heating and cooling piping systems for efficient energy distribution from central energy plants to multiple locations, (ii) primary and secondary containment piping systems for transporting chemicals, hazardous fluids and petroleum products, (iii) the coating and/or insulation of oil and gas gathering and transmission pipelines, and (iv) liquid and powder based anti-corrosion coatings applied both to the external and internal surfaces of steel pipe, including shapes like bends, reducers, tees, and other spools/fittings used in pipelines for the transportation of oil and gas products and potable water. The Company's leak detection systems are sold with its piping systems or on a stand-alone basis to monitor areas where fluid intrusion may contaminate the environment, endanger personal safety, cause a fire hazard, impair essential services or damage equipment or property. 

In 2015, the Company completed a project in the Middle East with billings in the aggregate amount of approximately million. The system has not yet been commissioned by the customer. Nevertheless, the Company has received approximately million as of October 31, 2024 , with a remaining balance due in the amount of million, all of which pertains to retention clauses within the agreements with the Company's customer, and which become payable by the customer when this project is fully tested and commissioned. Of this amount, million is classified in other long-term assets on the Company's consolidated balance sheets. 
 
 The Company has been actively involved in ongoing efforts to collect this outstanding balance. The Company continues to engage with the customer to ensure full payment of the open balances, and during the nine months ended October 31, 2024 , and at various times throughout 2023, the Company received partial payments to settle million and million, respectively, of the customer's outstanding balances. Further, the Company has been engaged by the customer to perform additional work in 2024 under customary trade terms that support the continued cooperation between the Company and the customer. As a result, the Company did not reserve any allowance against the remaining outstanding balances as of October 31, 2024 . However, if the Company's efforts to collect on this account are not successful, the Company may recognize an allowance for all, or substantially all, of any such then uncollected amounts. 
 
 For the three months ended October 31, 2024 , individual customer accounted for more than 10 of the Company's consolidated net sales, and during the same period in 2023, one customer accounted for greater than 10 of the Company's consolidated net sales. For the nine months ended October 31, 2024 and 2023 , individual customer accounted for more than 10 of the Company's consolidated net sales. 
 
 As of October 31, 2024 and January 31, 2024 , individual customer accounted for more than 10 of the Company's accounts receivable, and one customer accounted for more than 10 of the Company's accounts receivable, respectively.

 Revenue recognized under input method 
 Revenue recognized under output method 
 Total 

The input method as noted in ASC 606 - 10 - 55 - 20 is used by certain operating entities to measure revenue by the costs incurred to date relative to the estimated costs to satisfy the contract over time. Generally, these contracts are considered a single performance obligation satisfied over time and due to the custom nature of the goods and services, the "over time" method is the most faithful depiction of the Company s performance as it measures the value of the goods and services transferred to the customer. Costs include all material, labor, and other direct costs incurred to satisfy the performance obligations of the contract. Revenue recognition begins when projects costs are incurred. 

The output method as noted in ASC 606 - 10 - 55 - 17 is used by all other operating entities to measure revenue by the direct measurement of the outputs produced relative to the remaining goods promised under the contract. Due to the types of end customers, generally these contracts require formal inspection protocols or specific export documentation for units produced, or produced and shipped, therefore, the output method is the most faithful depiction of the Company s performance under the contract. Depending on the conditions of the contract, revenue may be recognized based on units produced, inspected and held by the Company prior to shipment or on units produced, inspected and shipped. 
 
 Contract assets and liabilities 
 
 Contract assets represent revenue recognized in excess of amounts billed for work in progress for which the Company has a valid contract and an enforceable right to payment for work completed. Contract liabilities represent billings in excess of costs for work in progress for which the Company has a valid contract and an enforceable right to payment for work completed. Both customer billings and the satisfaction (or partial satisfaction) of the performance obligation(s) occur throughout the manufacturing process and impact the period end balances in these accounts. In addition, contract assets include receivables or amounts that are billable beyond the passage of time. 
 
 The following table shows the reconciliation of costs in excess of billings and billings in excess of costs: 

Estimated earnings 
 Earned revenue 
 Less billings to date 
 Costs in excess of billings, net 
 Balance sheet classification 
 Contract assets: Costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts 
 Contract liabilities: Billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts 
 Costs in excess of billings, net 

The Company anticipates that substantially all costs incurred on uncompleted contracts as of October 31, 2024 will be billed and collected within one year . 
 
 Unbilled accounts receivable 
 
 The Company has recorded million and million of unbilled accounts receivable on the consolidated balance sheet s as of October 31, 2024 and January 31, 2024 , respectively, from revenues generated by certain of its subsidiaries. The Company has fulfilled all performance obligations and has recorded revenue under the respective contracts. The deliverables under these contracts have been accepted by the customer and billings will be made once the customer takes possession of or arranges shipping for the products. The Company anticipates that substantially all of the amounts included in unbilled accounts receivable as of October 31, 2024 will be billed within one year.

and , respectively. The Company's ETR was and for the nine months ended October 31, 2024 and 2023 , respectively. The change in the ETR is due to the ability to recognize tax benefits on losses in the United States in the current year, whereas the prior year had a full valuation allowance and changes to the mix of income and loss in various jurisdictions. 
 
 The Company expects that future distributions from foreign subsidiaries will not be subject to incremental U.S. federal tax as they will be excludible from U.S. taxable income either as remittances of previously taxed earnings and profits or eligible for a full dividends received deduction. Current and future earnings in the Company's subsidiaries in Canada and Egypt are not permanently reinvested. The earnings from these subsidiaries are subject to tax in their local jurisdiction, and withholding taxes in these jurisdictions are considered. As such, the Company has accrued a liability of million as of October 31, 2024 related to these taxes.

 The Company performs an impairment assessment of goodwill annually as of January 31, or more frequently if triggering events occur that could indicate that more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit did not exceed its carrying value, resulting in an impairment.

Under the Lease Agreement, the Company has four consecutive options to extend the term of the lease by five years for each such option.

 million Egyptian Pounds (approximately 
 2.0
 million at 
 October 31, 2024). This credit arrangement is in the form of project financing, for which the line is secured by certain assets (such as accounts receivable) of the Company's Egyptian subsidiary. Among other covenants, the credit arrangement established a maximum leverage ratio allowable and restricted the Company's Egyptian subsidiary's ability to undertake any additional debt. As of 
 October 31, 2024
 , the facility has an interest rate of approximately 
 20.8 
 and expired in November 2024. The Company has started the process to renew and extend this credit agreement and the credit facility has continued without interruption or penalty. As of 
 October 31, 2024
 , the Company had an immaterial amount outstanding with respect to this credit arrangement, and approximately 1.4 million outstanding at 
 January 31, 2024
 , which is presented as a component of current maturities of long-term debt in the Company's consolidated balance sheets. Further, as of 
 October 31, 2024
 and 
 January 31, 2024
 , the Company had unused borrowing capacity of 2.0 million and 3.2 million, respectively. 

In December 2021, the Company entered into a credit arrangement for project financing with a bank in Egypt for 28.2 million Egyptian Pounds. As this project has progressed and the Company has made collections, the facility has decreased to a current amount of 
 2.1
 million Egyptian Pounds (approximately 0.1 million at 
 October 31, 2024). This credit arrangement is in the form of project financing at rates competitive in Egypt. The line is secured by the contract for a project being financed by the Company's Egyptian subsidiary. The facility has an interest rate of approximately 
 11.0 
 and, as of November 2022, is no longer available for borrowings by the Company. The facility will expire in connection with final customer balance collections and the completion of the project. The Company had approximately 0.1 million outstanding 
 as of October 31, 2024 and January 31, 2024
 , respectively, and is presented as a component of current maturities of long-term debt in the Company's consolidated balance sheets. 

Saudi Arabia 

In March 2022, the Company's Saudi Arabian subsidiary entered into a credit arrangement with a bank in Saudi Arabia for a revolving line of 
 37.0
 million Saudi Riyals (approximately 
 9.9
 million at 
 October 31, 2024). This credit arrangement is in the form of project financing at rates competitive in Saudi Arabia. The line is secured by certain assets (such as accounts receivable) of the Company's Saudi Arabian subsidiary. The facility was renewed in May 2024 with substantially the same terms and conditions and expires in May 2025. As of 
 October 31, 2024
 , the facility has an interest rate of approximately 
 9.5 
 . The Company had borrowed an aggregate of 1.3 million and 3.2 million 
 as of October 31, 2024 and January 31, 2024
 , respectively, and is presented as a component of current maturities of long-term debt in the Company's consolidated balance sheets. The unused borrowing availability attributable to this credit arrangement at 
 October 31, 2024
 and 
 January 31, 2024
 , was 3.3 million and 6.1 million, respectively. 

These credit arrangements are in the form of overdraft facilities and project financing at rates competitive in the countries in which the Company operates. The lines are secured by certain equipment, certain assets (such as accounts receivable and inventory), and in some cases, a guarantee by the Company. Some credit arrangement covenants require a minimum tangible net worth to be maintained, including maintaining certain levels of intercompany subordinated debt. In addition, some of the revolving credit facilities restrict payment of dividends or undertaking of additional debt. The Company guarantees only a portion of the subsidiaries' debt, including foreign debt. The amount of foreign subsidiary debt guaranteed by the Company was approxim
 ately 1.1 million and 0.1 million at October 31, 2024 and January 31, 2024, respectively. 

The Company was in compliance with respect to the covenants under the credit arrangements in the U.A.E., Egypt, and Saudi Arabia as of
 October 31, 2024,
 with the exception of an arrangement that has expired and has not yet been renewed. Although a certain arrangement has expired and the borrowings could be required to be repaid immediately by the bank, the Company is in regular communication with the bank throughout the renewal process and the arrangement has continued without interruption or penalty. On
 October 31, 2024, interest rates were based on (i) the Emirates Inter Bank Offered Rate plus 3.0 to 3.5 per annum for the U.A.E. credit arrangements, two of which have a minimum interest rate of 4.5 per annum; (ii) either the Central Bank of Egypt corporate loan rate plus 1.5 to 3.5 per annum or the stated interest rate in the agreements for the Egypt credit arrangements; and (iii) the Saudi Inter-Bank Offered Rate plus 3.5 for the Saudi Arabia credit arrangement. Based on these base rates, as of
 October 31, 2024, the Company's interest rates ranged from 
 7.7 to
 20.8 , with a weighted average rate of
 10.6 , and the Company had facility limits totaling
 19.7 
 million under these credit arrangements.
 As of 
 October 31, 2024
 , 
 11.0 million 
 o 
 f availability was used to support letters of credit to guarantee amounts committed for inventory purchases and for performance guarantees. Additionally, as of 
 October 31, 2024
 , the Company had borrow 
 ed 
 3.2 million and had an additional 8.3 million of borrowing remaining available under the foreign revolving credit arrangements. The foreign revolving lines balances were included as a component of current maturities of long-term debt in the Company's consolidated balance sheets 
 as of October 31, 2024 and January 31, 2024.

In June 2023, the Company assumed a promissory note of approximately 2.8 million in connection with the formation of the joint venture with Gulf Insulation Group (see Note 16). I n accordance with the promissory note, all principal is due and payable on the maturity date of April 9, 2026, with the option to prepay, in whole or in part, at any time prior to the maturity date, without premium or penalty. 

Mortgages. On July 28, 2016, the Company entered into a mortgage agreement secured by the Company's manufacturing facility located in Alberta, Canada that matures on December 23, 2042. As of
 October 31, 2024, the remaining balance on the mortgage in Canada is approximately CAD
 5.8 million (approximately 
 4.2 million at
 October 31, 2024). The interest rate is variable, and was
 7.8 
 at
 October 31, 2024. The principal balance is included as a component of long-term debt, less current maturities in the Company's consolidated balance sheets and is presented net of issuance costs of 0.1 million 
 as of October 31, 2024 and January 31, 2024, respectively.

Finance obligation - buildings and land. 
 On April 14, 2021, the Company entered into a purchase and sale agreement, pursuant to which the Company sold its land and buildings in Lebanon, Tennessee (the "Property") for 10.4 million. The transaction generated net cash proceeds of 9.1 million. Concurrently with the sale, the Company paid off the approximately 0.9 million mortgage note on the Property to its lender. The Company used the remaining proceeds to repay its borrowings under the Senior Credit Facility, for strategic investments, and for general corporate needs. Concurrent with the sale of the Property, the Company entered into a fifteen-year lease agreement (the Lease Agreement ), whereby the Company leases back the Property at an annual rental rate of approximately 0.8 million, subject to annual rent increases of 2.0 . Under the Lease Agreement, the Company has four consecutive options to extend the term of the lease by five years for each such option. 

In accordance with ASC 842, Leases , this transaction was recorded as a failed sale and leaseback as the present value of lease payments exceeded substantially the fair value of the underlying assets. The Company utilized an incremental borrowing rate of 8.0 to determine the finance obligation to record for the amounts received and will continue to depreciate the assets. The current portion of the finance obligation of 0.2 million is recognized in current maturities of long-term debt and the long-term portion of 8.9 million is recognized in long-term finance obligation on the Company's consolidated balance sheets as of October 31, 2024 
 . The net carrying amount of the financial liability and remaining assets will be zero at the end of the lease term.

Accounts receivable: 

In 2015, the Company completed a project in the Middle East with billings in the aggregate amount of approximately 41.9 million. The system has not yet been commissioned by the customer. Nevertheless, the Company has received approximately 
 40.1 million as of
 October 31, 2024, with a remaining balance due in the amount of 
 1.8 million, all of which pertains to retention clauses within the agreements with the Company's customer, and which become payable by the customer when this project is fully tested and commissioned. Of this amount, 
 1.3 million is classified in other
 long-term assets on the Company's consolidated balance sheets. 

The Company has been actively involved in ongoing efforts to collect this outstanding balance. The Company continues to engage with the customer to ensure full payment of the open balances, and during the 
 nine months ended October 31, 2024, and at various times throughout 2023, the Company received partial payments to settle 
 0.3 million and 
 0.6 million, respectively, of the customer's outstanding balances. Further, the Company has been engaged by the customer to perform additional work in 2024 under customary trade terms that support the continued cooperation between the Company and the customer. As a result, the Company did not reserve any allowance against the remaining outstanding balances as of 
 October 31, 2024. However, if the Company's efforts to collect on this account are not successful, the Company may recognize an allowance for all, or substantially all, of any such then uncollected amounts.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES 
 
 Critical accounting policies are described in Item 7. MD A and in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended January 31, 2024 contained in the Company's latest Annual Report on Form 10-K. Any new accounting policies or updates to existing accounting policies as a result of new accounting pronouncements have been discussed in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The application of critical accounting policies may require management to make assumptions, judgments and estimates about the amounts reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Management uses historical experience and all available information to make these estimates and judgments, and different amounts could be reported using different assumptions and estimates.

Item 4. 
 Controls and Procedures 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 The Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have evaluated the effectiveness of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) as of October 31, 2024. This evaluation included consideration of the controls, processes and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports the Company files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and to provide reasonable assurance that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on this evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective because of the material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting, as described below. 
 
 Material Weaknesses in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
 A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company's annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. 
 
 There are material weaknesses in the Company's internal control over financial reporting, as follows. 
 
 We did not design and maintain effective controls in response to the risks of material misstatement. Specifically, changes to existing controls or the implementation of new controls have not been sufficient to respond to changes to the risks of material misstatement in financial reporting. This contributed to the following material weaknesses: 
 
 We did not design and maintain effective controls over information technology general controls ("ITGC"), specifically related to the policies and procedures over the timely review of security management and monitoring, user access and security administration, password control, administrative access, program change management, data security and back up, review of third-party SOC1 reports, and related management's review of the completeness and accuracy of certain system-generated reports. These material weaknesses did not result in a misstatement to the Company's annual or interim financial statements. 
 
 Additionally, we did not design and maintain effective controls over certain controls over financial reporting relating to the review and approval of manual journal entries, review of the financial close process, including the statement of cash flows, and review of certain financial policies and procedures and respective HR policies. We also did not design and maintain effective controls at operating locations in the Middle East and North Africa ("MENA"), including not maintaining sufficient documentation to support an evaluation that controls over business processes were designed and operating effectively. These material weaknesses resulted in adjustments to property, plant, and equipment, net of accumulated depreciation, trade accounts payable, trade accounts receivable, and the statement of cash flows. These adjustments resulted in a revision of the unaudited consolidated financial statements as of and for the period ended April 30, 2024, a restatement as of and for the period ended July 31, 2024 and material adjustments as of and for the period ended October 31, 2024. Additionally, there is a reasonable possibility that each of these material weaknesses could result in material misstatements of substantially all accounts and disclosures in the Company's annual or interim financial statements that would not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. 
 
 Remediation Plan for the Material Weaknesses in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 To address these matters, the Company has begun implementing its remediation plan. Our ongoing remediation plans include the following: 
 
 (i) designing and implementing controls to identify and evaluate changes in our business and the impact on our internal control over financial reporting; (ii) addressing the identified issues with control owners, including Company leadership and IT personnel; (iii) engaging outside consultants with expertise relating to ITGCs to document processes, assist in addressing the design and operating ITGCs controls, monitoring and testing reviews focusing on systems supporting our financial reporting process (iv) developing and maintaining controls and documentation evidencing those controls underlying ITGCs for knowledge transfer and function changes, including access and program control and change management, data security and back up, reviewing third party SOC1 reports, and reviewing the completeness and accuracy of certain system-generated reports;; and (v) outsourcing certain functions to third-party providers, specifically relating to servers and firewalls, and managed detection and response. 
 
 Our remediation plans related to entity level controls, financial reporting controls, and business process controls include: 
 
 (i) enhancing the design of controls for the review of and posting of a complete set of journal entries; (ii) evaluating and updating documented formal accounting policies, financial reporting, HR, and financial processes; and overall internal control procedures; and (iii) updating the design of controls for the preparation and review of the statement of cash flows. 
 
 Our remediation plans related to our MENA locations include: (i) addressing issues with control owners, including company leadership; (ii) evaluating and updating the Company's evidence of internal control policies and procedures as needed and providing necessary guidance to applicable locations; (iii) assessing the adequacy and determine whether enhancements are needed to the design of corporate and / or operating locations business process controls; and (iv) augmenting our internal audit function by hiring an additional resource to assist in overseeing the remediation process, including updating policies and procedures, and implementing internal controls; and (v) engaging outside consultants to conduct training sessions. 
 
 The Company anticipates the actions described above and resulting improvements in controls will strengthen the Company's processes, procedures and will address the related material weaknesses described above. However, the material weaknesses cannot be considered fully remediated until the necessary controls have been appropriately designed and implemented. The remediation processes and procedures will also need to be in operation for a period of time and management conclude through testing, that these controls are operating effectively. 
 
 Change in Internal Control over Financial Reporting . There were no changes to our internal control over financial reporting which were identified in connection with the evaluation required by Rules 13a-15(d) or 15d-15(d) under the Exchange Act during the fiscal quarter ended July 31, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
