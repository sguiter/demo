 Notes

 September

shares of common stock in exchange for 
of the outstanding membership interests in Shuttle prior to conversion. On June 4, 2018, Shuttle completed a reverse merger with
Shuttle Pharmaceuticals Holdings, Inc. (then known as Shuttle Pharma Acquisition Corp, Inc.), a Delaware corporation, pursuant to
which Shuttle, our operating entity, became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. All share numbers referenced herein reflect a
1-for-8 reverse split of our common stock on a post-split basis, which was effective as of August 13, 2024 (see Note 2). 

The
Company s primary purpose is to develop and commercialize unique drugs for the sensitization of cancers and protection of normal
tissues, with the goal of improving outcomes for cancer patients receiving radiation therapy. Shuttle has deployed its proprietary technology
to develop novel cancer immunotherapies, producing a pipeline of selective HDAC inhibitors for cancer and immunotherapy applications.
The Company s HDAC platform is designed to target candidate molecules with potential roles in therapeutics beyond cancer, including
autoimmune, inflammatory, metabolic, neurological and infectious diseases. The Company s Ropidoxuridine product, which is used
with radiation therapy to sensitize cancer cells, was initially funded by a Small Business Innovation Research SBIR contract
provided by the National Cancer Institute NCI ), a unit of the National Institutes of Health NIH ). Ropidoxuridine
has been further developed though the Company s collaborations with scientists at the University of Virginia for use in combination
with proton therapy to improve patient survival. Historically, and prior to the Company s initial public offering in September
2022, the Company has obtained funding to develop products through NIH grants, including a product to predict late effects of radiation
with metabolite biomarkers and develop prostate cancer cell lines in health disparities research. 

The
production and marketing of the Company s products and its ongoing research and development activities will be and are subject
to extensive regulation by numerous governmental authorities in the United States. Prior to marketing in the United States, any products
or combination of products developed by the Company must undergo rigorous preclinical (animal) and clinical (human) testing and an extensive
regulatory approval process implemented by the Food and Drug Administration FDA under the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act.
There can be no assurance that the Company will not encounter problems in its clinical trials that will cause the Company or the FDA
to delay or suspend the clinical trials. 

The
Company s success will depend in part on its ability to obtain patents and product license rights, maintain trade secrets, and
operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others, both in the United States and in other countries. There can be no assurance
that patents issued to or licensed by the Company will not be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, or that the rights granted thereunder
will provide proprietary protection or competitive advantages to the Company now or in the future. 

Liquidity
and Going Concern 

Our
unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets
and the satisfaction of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. The Company has incurred losses since inception
and has a net loss of approximately million and no revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and has a working capital
deficit of approximately million as of September 30, 2024. The Company does not expect to generate positive cash flows from operating
activities in the near future. 

In
September 2024, the Company s CEO provided thousand to the Company in exchange for a promissory note repayable in equal monthly
installments of principal and interest over a term of . In October 2024, the Company completed an offering of senior secured
convertible bridge notes, receiving thousand in cash. The notes have a term of one-year and were accompanied by warrants
with a weighted-average exercise price of . Also in October 2024, the Company completed an equity raise that provided million
net cash for the issuance of million shares / pre-funded warrants, and by million warrants with an exercise price of . However,
the Company s existing cash resources and the cash received from the equity offering and senior convertible note are not expected
to provide sufficient funds to carry out the Company s operations and clinical trials through the next twelve months. 

The
Company s capital raises have to date supported operations, the manufacture of drug product and FDA approval of the IND for the
Phase II clinical trial of Ropidoxuridine and radiation therapy in glioblastoma and other radiation sensitizer discovery and therapy.
The FDA recommended and the Company agreed to an expansion of the Phase II clinical trial, necessitating additional capital to complete
the trial as well as fund ongoing operations. Additionally, the Phase II clinical trial of Ropidoxuridine has evolved with finalized
agreements with all six of the planned site enrollment locations to administer the Phase II clinical trial of Ropidoxuridine and the
enrollment of the first three patients. 

The
ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to continue to successfully raise additional equity
or debt financing to allow it to fund ongoing operations, conduct clinical trials and bring a drug candidate to commercialization to
generate revenues. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern within one
year after the date that the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements are issued. 

The
accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the future effects on the
recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities if the Company is unable to continue as
a going concern. 

per share (the Minimum Bid Price Requirement ),
the Company effectuated a reverse stock split of its issued and outstanding common stock, rounding up to account for any fractional
shares (the Reverse Stock Split ). The Reverse Stock Split had no effect on the Company s authorized shares of common
stock or preferred stock and the par value will remain unchanged at , respectively. All common stock share, option, warrant and
per share amounts (except our authorized but unissued shares and previously reserved shares) have been retroactively adjusted in these
financial statements and related disclosures.

For
issued or modified warrants that meet all of the criteria for equity classification, the warrants are required to be recorded as a component
of additional paid-in capital at the time of issuance. For issued or modified warrants that do not meet all the criteria for equity classification,
the warrants are required to be recorded at their initial fair value on the date of issuance, and each balance sheet date thereafter.
Changes in the estimated fair value of the warrants are recognized as a non-cash gain or loss on the unaudited condensed consolidated
statements of operations. The fair value of the warrants is estimated using a Black-Scholes pricing model or a Monte Carlo simulation. 

million
and million, respectively, and million and million, respectively, was included within research and development due to
their active involvement in the research and development activities, materials, supplies, related subcontract expenses, and consulting
costs. In June 2024, the Company recruited a new chief financial officer who is substantially devoted to administrative functions and
our then existing chief financial officer, who also handled research and development compliance functions, transitioned to substantially
research and development functions. 

Regarding
the accounting treatment for reimbursements, GAAP provides limited guidance on the accounting for government grants received by for-profit
companies. In accordance with ASC Topic 832, Government Assistance , as adopted January 1, 2022, we disclose certain types of government
assistance received in the notes to the consolidated financial statements that includes: a) the nature of the transaction including the
nature of the assistance being given, b) the accounting policies being used to account for the transaction and c) other provisions of
relevance, where required. Depending on the type of grant or contract, we understand there is more than one acceptable alternative for
the accounting treatment a reduction of costs, a deferred credit to be amortized, revenue or other income. The Company has concluded
that reimbursements received for R D expenses incurred, are more akin to a reduction of costs and applies reimbursements against
incurred research costs. There were no reimbursements received for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

On

convertible note (the Alto Convertible Note and warrant (the Warrant to purchase shares
of common stock, exercisable at per share, as adjusted, in exchange for gross proceeds of (the Investment Amount (See Note 7). The Company determined that the Warrant contains a net cash settlement feature at inception and categorized the Warrant
as a liability in the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. The Alto Convertible Note matures on March
11, 2025, but may be extended at the option of the noteholder. The Alto Convertible Note amortizes on a monthly basis and the Company
can make such monthly amortization payments in cash or, subject to certain equity conditions, in registered shares of common stock or
a combination thereof. Installments may be deferred by the noteholder, resulting in a variable interest rate. However, the effective
interest rate is approximately based on the internal rate of return calculated on a series of cash flows that occur at regular intervals.
For equity repayment, The noteholder has an
acceleration of installment amount conversion option (the Acceleration Option ), whereby the noteholder, with certain share
percentage limitations, can convert to common stock any outstanding installment amount at an amount equal to the installment amount plus
five times (5x) the installment amount at any time. The Company has determined the Acceleration Option is an embedded derivative within
the host instrument and has bifurcated it from the host instrument and recorded it as a derivative liability valued at at
inception, using a Monte Carlo simulation model (Note 7). The Convertible Note is repayable over 26 months and bears interest at the
rate of per annum. Additionally, the note contains certain redemption options and Make Whole provisions. 

In
conjunction with entry into the SPA, the Company entered into a series of related agreements, including a security agreement (the Security
Agreement ), an intellectual property security agreement (the IP Security Agreement and a subsidiary guaranty (the
 Subsidiary Guaranty ). The security agreements and guaranty allow, among other things, for the Investor to have a security
interest in and place a lien on all of the Company s assets and intellectual property until such time as the Alto Convertible Note
is paid off. In addition, the SPA called for the Company to enter into a springing deposit account control agreement (the Springing
DACA ), which, in the event the Company defaults on its repayment of the Alto Convertible Note, would allow the Investor to assume
control of the Company s bank account only with regard to any funds remaining outstanding under the Alto Convertible Note. As such,
in conjunction with entry into the SPA, the Company established a separate bank account in which it deposited the Investment Amount and
pursuant to which the Company, the Investor and the bank holding the Investment Amount, First Republic Bank, entered into the Springing
DACA agreement. As the Investment Amount had been held at First Republic Bank, in light of certain banking crises then affecting smaller
banks, on March 12, 2023, the Company and the Investor moved the Investment Amount from First Republic Bank, after which time the Springing
DACA was no longer in effect. Further, pursuant to amendments to the SPA entered into in May and June of 2023, the Company and the Investor
agreed that all of the Investment Amount would be released to the Company and the relevant provision of the SPA which required the Springing
DACA would no longer be deemed applicable. In addition, the Company granted the Investor the option to purchase up to an additional 
million in convertible notes and warrants on substantially the same terms as the Alto Convertible Note and Warrant, excluding the Springing
DACA requirement, with such option to be effective through December 31, 2025. The agreement offers the investor an opportunity to participate
in future capital raises at substantially similar terms as the January 11, 2023 agreement. The Company expects that such subsequent convertible
notes and warrants would be issued on substantially similar terms as the January 11, 2023 initial agreement, as amended, thus providing
the Company the opportunity to negotiate certain aspects of the agreement. 

Boustead
Securities, LLC Boustead served as a placement agent for the Alto Convertible Note and Warrant offering and received
 cash compensation and a warrant to purchase shares of common stock, exercisable at per share. The Boustead warrant
was determined to be an equity instrument valued on a non-recurring basis. The Company used the Black Scholes valuation model using a
term of , volatility of , a risk-free rate of for a value of . 

The
Company allocated the finance costs related to the Boustead placement agent fee of , based on the relative fair market values
of the Convertible Note and warrants issued. The allocation of the financing costs applied to the debt component as a debt discount
that is being amortized to interest expense over the term of the Convertible Note, to the warrant derivative liability component,
expensed as a finance fee, and to the equity warrant as a reduction in additional paid in capital. 

The
Company allocated to the debt component of the note an original discount of , legal fees of , for additional
interest fees on day one added to note principal, for the accelerated conversion feature, and for the fair value
of warrants, resulting in an additional debt discount that is being amortized to interest expense over the term of the Alto
Convertible Note. 

On
August 6, 2024, the Company entered into an amendment to the SPA with Alto. Under the Amendment Agreement, the Company and Alto agreed
as follows: (i) that the Company would pay (the Cash Collateral in cash by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to Alto, which would be held as collateral on the remaining million outstanding under the Alto Note; (ii) Alto will defer
the monthly installment payment due on September 3, 2024 under the Alto Note until the Alto Note s March 11, 2025 maturity date;
and (iii) Alto would grant a waiver of any default Section 4(a)(xvi) of the Note related to the restatement and reaudit of the Company s
financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2023. The amendment was accounted for as a troubled debt restructuring as the Company determined it was experiencing
financial difficulties and was provided a concession through the deferral of one monthly principal and interest payment. As the future
undiscounted cash flows exceeded the carrying value of the Alto Convertible Note, the Company did not recognize any gain or loss associated
with the troubled debt restructuring.

30, 2024, at . The Company determined our derivative liabilities from the warrants issued in relation to the Alto Convertible
Note do not satisfy the classification as equity instruments due to the existence of a certain net cash settlement provision that is
not within the sole control of the Company. In addition, there are certain down round provisions that could reduce the exercise price
if the Company issues securities at lower prices in the future. 

The
Company has determined the Acceleration Option is an embedded derivative within the host instrument and has bifurcated it from the host
instrument and recorded it as a derivative liability valued at , using a Monte Carlo simulation model. The Company determined
our derivative liability from the noteholder s Acceleration Option for the Alto Convertible Note is not clearly and closely related
to the host and should be thus accounted for as a bifurcated derivative liability. 

The
Company classified these derivative liabilities as a Level 3 fair value measurement and used the Monte Carlo pricing model to calculate

are summarized below. The Monte Carlo simulation uses an implied VWAP for the January 11, 2023 valuation date. The implied VWAP was backsolved
by setting the summation of the parts (e.g., derivatives and debt without derivatives) equal to the cash proceeds. The simulation was
then iterated and manipulated to solve for the implied share price, which was approximately per share (or an approximate discount
to the quoted market VWAP on January 11, 2023).

Overview 

Founded
by Georgetown University Medical School faculty members, Shuttle Pharmaceuticals Holdings, Inc. (the Company is a discovery
and development stage pharmaceutical company leveraging our proprietary technology to develop novel therapies that are designed to cure
cancer. Originally formed as Shuttle Pharmaceuticals, LLC in 2012, our goal is to extend the benefits of cancer treatments by leveraging
insights into cancer therapy with surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy and immunotherapy. While there are several therapies being
developed with the goal of curing cancer, one of the most effective and proven approaches to this is radiation therapy (RT). We are developing
a pipeline of products designed to address the limitations of the current standard of cancer therapies. We believe that our product candidates
will enable us to deliver cancer treatments that are safer, more reliable and at a greater scale than that of the current standard of
care. 

Operations
to date have focused on continuing our research and development efforts to advance Ropidoxuridine clinical testing and improved drug
formulation, to advance HDAC6 inhibitor (SP-2-225) preclinical development and explore new Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)
contract work on predictive biomarkers of radiation response, as well as prostate cell lines for health disparities research. We received
SBIR contract funding from the National Institutes of Health (NIH), for the aforementioned projects. The clinical development of Ropidoxuridine
has shown drug bioavailability and a maximum tolerated dose has been established for use in Phase II clinical trials. TCG GreenChem,
Inc. TCG GreenChem ), with whom we have contracted for process research, development and cGMP compliant manufacture of
IPdR, has successfully completed the manufacturing campaign for the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) of Ropidoxuridine for use
in the Company s upcoming Phase II clinical trial in brain cancer patients undergoing radiation therapy. Shuttle also worked with
University of Iowa Pharmaceuticals to develop the formulation, produce the capsules, and which have been shipped to Contract Research
Organization (CRO) Theradex Oncology for distribution to clinical trial sites. Both activities have now been completed. In addition,
Shuttle received approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to begin the clinical trial. The FDA made recommendations
to expand the clinical trial and the Company agreed with the recommendation. With this change incorporated into the revised protocol,
the Company commenced its Phase II clinical study with finalized agreements with all six of the planned site enrollment locations to
administer the Phase II clinical trial of Ropidoxuridine and has enrolled the first three patients in October 2024. The radiation biomarker
project and the health disparities project have been completed and the Company is following up with plans for clinical validation and
potential commercialization. Changes in operational, administrative, legal and professional expenses related to our operations are set
forth in more detail in the discussion below. 

Reverse
Stock Split 

On
August 13, 2024, in order to meet the Nasdaq minimum bid price requirement, the Company effectuated a 1-for-8 reverse stock split of
its issued and outstanding common stock, rounding up to account for any fractional shares (the Reverse Stock Split ). The
Reverse Stock Split had no effect on the Company s authorized shares of common stock or preferred stock. All share, option, warrant
and per share amounts (except our authorized outstanding and previously reserved shares) have been retroactively recast in our most recent
filings, and are presented as such in these financial statements and related disclosures.

Nasdaq
Listing Compliance 

On
September 10, 2024, the Company received a letter (the Notification from The Nasdaq Capital Market Nasdaq ),
notifying the Company that it is no longer in compliance with the minimum stockholders equity requirement for continued listing
on the Nasdaq Capital Market. Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b)(1) requires listed companies to maintain stockholders equity of at least
 2,500,000. In the Company s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended June 30, 2024, the Company reported stockholders 
equity of 801,434, which is below the minimum stockholders equity required for continued listing pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rule
5550(b)(1). In addition, presently, the Company does not meet the alternatives of market value of listed securities or net income from
continuing operations. 

This
Notification has no immediate effect on the listing of the Company s securities on the Nasdaq Capital Market. Nasdaq has provided
the Company with 45 calendar days, or until October 25, 2024, to submit a plan to regain compliance with the minimum stockholders 
equity standard. If the Company s plan to regain compliance is accepted, Nasdaq may grant an extension of up to 180 calendar days
from September 10, 2024 for the Company to regain compliance. 

On
October 15, 2024, the Company submitted a plan to Nasdaq to regain compliance. However, there can be no assurance that the
Company s plan will be accepted or that, if it is, that the Company will be able to regain compliance and maintain its listing
on the Nasdaq Capital Market. If the Company s plan to regain compliance is not accepted or if Nasdaq does not grant an
extension and the Company does not regain compliance, or if the Company fails to satisfy another Nasdaq requirement for continued
listing, Nasdaq could provide notice that the Company s securities will become subject to delisting. In that event, the
Company will have an opportunity to appeal Nasdaq s decision to a hearings panel.

Research
and Development. Research and development R D expenses were 1.4 million for the three months ended September
30, 2024, as compared to 1.0 million for three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase of 0.4 million, or 34 , is primarily related
to the Company having completed production of the drug product and the start of work related to the initiation of trials. 

R D
compensation related expenses were 0.3 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 0.3 million in the three
months ended September 30, 2023. Compensation related expenses were 22 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, representing a
decrease from 29 of total R D in the three months ended September 30, 2023. Subcontract work made up 73 of total R D expenses
in the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 65 of total R D expenses during the three months ended September 30, 2023. 

General
and Administrative Expenses. General and Administrative expenses in the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 63 thousand,
or 24 to 0.33 million in the three months ended June 30, 2024, compared to 0.27 million in the three months ended September 30, 2023,
largely due to costs associated with the additional focus on financial reporting and capital needs. 

Legal
and Professional Expenses . During the three months ended September 30, 2024, legal and professional expenses increased by 1.0 million
or 358 to 1.3 million compared to 0.3 million in the same period in the prior year. The increase in legal and professional fees was
primarily due to increases in our expenses related to our public filing requirements, reaudits, contracts, and financing related work. 

Other
Income Expense . Other expense was 0.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, which consisted primarily of 0.3 million
in interest expense on convertible loans, loss on settlement of debt of 0.8 million, and a gain on change in fair value of derivative
liabilities of 0.3 million. Other expense was 0.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, which consisted primarily
of 0.4 million in interest expense on convertible loans, loss on settlement of convertible debt of 0.8 million, and a gain on change
in fair value of derivative liabilities of 0.4 million. The 0.4 million gain in fair value of derivative liability resulted from the
fair value measurement using the Monte Carlo pricing model and the impact of the decrease in the market price of warrant shares. These
amounts were largely attributable to the Alto Convertible Note conversions and cash management activities.

and Administrative Expenses. General and Administrative expenses in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 0.2 million,
or 32 to 1.0 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily
due to increases in marketing, advertising and filing expenses. 

Legal
and Professional Expenses . During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, legal and professional expenses increased by 1.3 million
or 117 . The increase in legal and professional fees was primarily due to increases in our expenses related to our public filing requirements,
reaudits, contracts and financing related work. 

Other
Income Expense . Other expense was 1.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, which consisted primarily of 1.2 million
in interest expense on convertible loans, loss on settlement of convertible debt of 0.8 million, change in marketable securities of
 0.1 million, and a gain on change in fair value of derivative liabilities of 0.3 million. Other expense was 0.3 million for the nine
months ended September 30, 2023, which consisted primarily of 2.0 million in interest expense on convertible loans, finance fee on convertible
loans of 0.1 million, loss on settlement of convertible debt of 0.5 million, and a gain on change in fair value of derivative liabilities
of 2.1 million. The 2.1 million gain in fair value of derivative liability resulted from the fair value measurement using the Monte
Carlo pricing model and the impact of the decrease in the market price of warrant shares. These amounts were largely attributable to
the Alto Convertible Note conversions and cash management activities. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

Our
unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets
and the satisfaction of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. The Company has incurred losses since inception
and has a net loss of approximately 7.5 million and no revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and has a working capital
deficit of approximately 1.3 million as of September 30, 2024. The Company does not expect to generate positive cash flows from operating
activities in the near future. 

In
September 2024, the Company s CEO provided 250 thousand to the Company in exchange for a promissory note repayable in equal monthly
installments of principal and interest over a term of one year. In October 2024, the Company completed an offering of senior secured
convertible bridge notes, receiving 790 thousand in cash. The notes have a term of one-year and were accompanied by 329,461 warrants
with a weighted-average exercise price of 1.42. Also in October 2024, the Company completed an equity raise that provided 3.9 million
net cash for the issuance of 2.9 million shares / pre-funded warrants, and by 2.9 million warrants with an exercise price of 1.40. However,
the Company s existing cash resources and the cash received from the equity offering and senior convertible note are not expected
to provide sufficient funds to carry out the Company s operations and clinical trials through the next twelve months. 

24 

The
Company s capital raises have to date supported operations, the manufacture of drug product and FDA approval of the IND for the
Phase II clinical trial of Ropidoxuridine and radiation therapy in glioblastoma and other radiation sensitizer discovery and therapy.
The FDA recommended and the Company agreed to an expansion of the Phase II clinical trial, necessitating additional capital to complete
the trial as well as fund ongoing operations. Additionally, the Phase II clinical trial of Ropidoxuridine has evolved with finalized
agreements with all six of the planned site enrollment locations to administer the Phase II clinical trial of Ropidoxuridine and the
enrollment of the first three patients. 

The
ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to continue to successfully raise additional equity
or debt financing to allow it to fund ongoing operations, conduct clinical trials and bring a drug candidate to commercialization to
generate revenues. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern within one
year after the date that the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements are issued. 

The
accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the future effects on the
recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities if the Company is unable to continue as
a going concern.

 0.1 million in prepaid expenses and 0.1 million in deferred costs, with the decrease from December 31, 2023 being primarily due to
ongoing cash burn from our R D programs, filing expenses, reaudits, and general operations. The increase in current liabilities is
primarily due to an increase in accounts payable of 1.1 million compared to December 31, 2023, partially offset by the net change in
amounts owed under convertible notes and notes payable of 0.5 million.

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements 

We
do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial
condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources
that are material to investors. 

Critical
Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates 

This
discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our unaudited condensed consolidated financial
statements, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States GAAP ).
The preparation of these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the unaudited condensed
consolidated financial statements, as well as the reported expenses incurred during the reporting periods. Our estimates are based on
our historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form
the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual
results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. While our significant accounting policies are described
in more detail in the notes to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report, we believe
that the following accounting policies are critical to understanding our historical and future performance, as these policies relate
to the more significant areas involving management s judgments and estimates. 

Our
most critical accounting policies and estimates relate to the following: 

Research
 and Development Expenses 

Fair
 Value of Derivative Financial Instruments 

Initial
 Measurement of Equity-Based Warrants 

Research
and Development 

Research
and development expenses are expensed as incurred and, prior to our initial public offering in September 2022, have historically been
offset by contract receivable payments from an NIH SBIR contract that has supported our scientific research. This is stated in the financials
as research and development-net of contract expense reimbursements. 

Fair
Value of Financial Instruments 

We
evaluate all of our financial instruments to determine if such instruments are derivatives or contain features that qualify as embedded
derivatives. For derivative financial instruments that are accounted for as liabilities, the derivative instrument is initially recorded
at its fair value and is then re-valued at each reporting date, with changes in the fair value reported in the unaudited condensed consolidated
statements of operations. The classification of derivative instruments, including whether such instruments should be recorded as liabilities
are evaluated at the end of each reporting period. 

26 

For
our derivative financial instruments classified as a liability, the Company uses a Monte Carlo valuation model to value the derivative
instruments at inception and on subsequent valuation dates. The model requires the use of simulations that are weighted based on significant
unobservable inputs including the average volatility of a population set and probabilities assigned. Each simulation is based on the
range of inputs in a scenario with the mean of the output on each simulation calculated as an average. The Monte Carlo simulation uses
an implied VWAP for valuation. The implied VWAP was backsolved by setting the summation of the parts (e.g., derivatives and debt without
derivatives) equal to the cash proceeds and is updated each period. 

The
use of Monte Carlo valuation models require key inputs, some of which are based on estimates and judgements by management. Any change
to these key inputs could produce significantly higher or lower fair value measurements. 

Initial
Measurement of Equity-Based Warrants 

We
evaluate all of our financial instruments to determine if such instruments are derivatives or contain features that qualify as embedded
derivatives. For derivative financial instruments that are accounted for as equity, the derivative instrument is initially recorded at
its fair value and recorded to additional paid in capital. The classification of derivative instruments, including whether such instruments
should be recorded as equity, is evaluated at the end of each reporting period. 

For
our derivative financial instruments classified as equity, the Company used a Black Scholes valuation model, to calculate the fair value
on issuance date, without revaluation. 

The
use of Black Scholes valuation model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions, including the expected price volatility, that
is based on an analysis of the historical volatility of the common stock of a group of comparable entities. Any change to these inputs
could produce significantly higher or lower fair value measurements. 

Item
3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 

As
a smaller reporting company, we are not required to provide the information required by this Item. 

Item
4. Controls and Procedures 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Disclosure
controls and procedures (as defined in Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act Rule 15d-15(e)) are designed
with the objective of ensuring that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act, such as this report,
is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls
and procedures are also designed with the objective of ensuring that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management,
including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

As
of September 30, 2024, our management carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls
and procedures. Such evaluation was carried out under the supervision of our Chief Executive Officer with the participation of our President
and Chief Operating Officer, and our Chief Financial Officer, and our third-party financial service provider. Based on this evaluation,
management concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were, and continue to be, ineffective as of September 30, 2024. Based
on the foregoing, our management concluded that our internal controls over the following financial reporting areas to be material weaknesses: 

Our
 written accounting policies and documentation of management s contemplation of the accounting treatment and implications over
 significant unusual transactions, including complex accounting associated with debt and equity transactions, is limited and resulted
 in ineffective monitoring of financial reporting. These were contributing factors which lead to untimely filings. 

27 

Due
 to our size and stage of development, segregation of all conflicting duties may not always be possible and may not be economically
 feasible. During the reporting period, we lacked sufficient review procedures and segregation of duties such that a proper review
 had not been performed by someone other than a preparer, including manual journal entries, and that process documentation is lacking
 for review and monitoring controls over financial statements close process and financial reporting. 

As
 a result of the Company s evolution since the date of our initial formation, when we were focused on NIH SBIR research contracts
 with related costing allocation allowances until when we completed our IPO and continued our development process, management lacks
 a formal process to identify and properly classify operating expenses such as R D. 

We
 identified findings related to overall information technology general controls including issues with access and segregation of duties
 for systems supporting the Company s internal control processes and controls. 

Our
 accounting policies and oversight regarding certain technical aspects of financial reporting for stock-based compensation transactions,
 particularly relating to grant date valuations and expense attribution, is limited and resulted in the incorrect recording of related
 compensation expense and related disclosures. 

Except
as noted below, there has been no change in the Company s internal control over financial reporting during the three months ended
September 30, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over
financial reporting. Management will continue to monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of our internal controls and procedures over
financial reporting on an ongoing basis and is committed to taking further action and implementing additional improvements as necessary. 

Management s
Remediation Measures 

The
aforementioned material weaknesses were identified in 2023 and 2024 and the ineffective monitoring of financial reporting weaknesses
resulted in the Company needing to restate its 2023 and 2022 financial statements. While the Company has improved its organizational
capabilities, the Company s remediation efforts will continue to take place. Management is committed to maintaining a strong internal
control environment. In response to the identified material weaknesses in the overall control environment, management is currently implementing
additional measures which include: 

Hired
 a new Chief Financial Officer CFO during the second quarter of 2024 to bolster the Company s internal technical
 accounting and financial reporting experience and provide bandwidth for the prior CFO to focus on the Company s expanding clinical
 trial. 

Engaged
 a third-party consulting firm to assist with the preparation of SEC reporting and other technical accounting matters. 

The
Company will continue to review and improve its internal controls over financial reporting to address the underlying causes of the material
weaknesses and control deficiencies. Such material weaknesses and control deficiencies will not be fully remediated until the Company
has concluded that its internal controls are operating effectively for a sufficient period of time.
