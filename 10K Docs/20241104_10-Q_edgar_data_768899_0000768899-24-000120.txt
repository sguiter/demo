 premium or greater. 
 We performed an interim impairment test as of the last day of the fiscal first quarter of 2024, as well as a qualitative assessment for our annual impairment test one day later, which did not result in impairment of goodwill for any reporting unit. During the fiscal second quarter of 2024, management determined that a triggering event had occurred as a result of additional decline in demand for our services, prolonged economic uncertainty, and a further decrease in our stock price. Therefore, we performed an additional interim impairment test as of the last day of fiscal May 2024. Refer to Note 6: Goodwill and Intangible Assets for additional details on the interim impairment test, valuation methodologies, and inputs used in the fair value measurements.

During the fiscal second quarter of 2024, management determined the reasonable assurance criteria was met for certain payroll tax credits for which recognition was previously deferred. As a result, million and million was recognized within cost of services and selling, general and administrative SG A expense, respectively, on the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss) for the thirty-nine weeks ended September 29, 2024. Also, this resulted in a reversal of previously accrued interest related to these benefits of million, offset by recognition of related professional fees of million, which were recorded within interest and other income (expense), net and SG A expense, respectively, on the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss) for the thirty-nine weeks ended September 29, 2024. 
 As of September 29, 2024, we have deferred recognition of million within accrued wages and benefits on our Consolidated Balance Sheets related to certain payroll tax credits, including accrued interest, until recognition becomes probable.

 million, plus contingent consideration of up to million based on the achievement of the results of the business as specified in the Agreement. The sale price is subject to adjustment based on the closing working capital of the divested business. We received cash proceeds of million, net of million of transaction costs and million held in escrow until finalization of the closing working capital and expiration of the indemnification period. We recognized a pre-tax gain on the divestiture of million, which is included in interest and other income (expense), net on the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss) for the thirty-nine weeks ended September 29, 2024. The operating results for PeopleReady Canada were reported in the PeopleReady reportable segment through the closing date, including million in revenue. The divestiture of PeopleReady Canada did not represent a strategic shift with a major effect on the company's operations and financial results and, therefore was not reported as a discontinued operation, nor was it an individually significant component of the company.

 Assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis 
 In addition to assets that are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis, annual and interim impairment tests may subject our reporting units with goodwill and other intangible assets to nonrecurring fair value measurement. We performed impairment tests for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets during our fiscal second quarter of 2024. Refer to Note 6: Goodwill and Intangible Assets for additional details on the impairment charges, valuation methodologies, and inputs used in the fair value measurements. 
 For our interim goodwill impairment test as of the last day of fiscal May 2024, the fair value of each reporting unit was estimated using an equal weighting of the income and market approaches, except for PeopleScout MSP, which relied only on the income approach. The various inputs to these fair value models are considered Level 3. As a result of the test, goodwill with a carrying value of million associated with the PeopleReady reporting unit was impaired, and an impairment charge of million was recognized on our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss) for the thirty-nine weeks ended September 29, 2024.

million. The sale is expected to be finalized within one year, subject to customary closing conditions. As a result, during the fiscal second quarter, we classified these assets as held-for-sale and ceased recording depreciation. As the estimated fair value of the disposal group, less costs to sell, exceeded its carrying value of million, no impairment charge was recorded during the thirty-nine weeks ended September 29, 2024. 
 Assets held-for-sale as of December 31, 2023 represented the assets included as part of the disposal group related to the eventual divestiture of PeopleReady Canada, which was finalized during the fiscal first quarter of 2024. Refer to Note 2: Divestiture for additional details.

 Annual impairment test 
 We performed an interim impairment test as of the last day of the fiscal first quarter of 2024, as management determined that a triggering event had occurred as a result of continued decline for our services, overall economic uncertainty, and a sustained decrease in our stock price, which did not result in impairment of goodwill for any reporting unit. Given the proximity of our first quarter interim impairment measurement date to our annual goodwill impairment measurement date (first day of the fiscal second quarter), we performed a qualitative assessment to determine whether it was more likely than not that the fair value of any of our reporting units was less than the carrying value. We considered the current and expected future economic and market conditions and concluded it was unlikely the goodwill associated with our reporting units was impaired as of the first day of our fiscal second quarter. 
 Interim impairment test 
 During the fiscal second quarter of 2024, subsequent to our annual test as of the first day of our fiscal second quarter, management determined that a triggering event had occurred as a result of additional decline in demand for our services, prolonged economic uncertainty, and a further decrease in our stock price. Therefore, we performed an interim impairment test as of the last day of fiscal May 2024 for our reporting units with remaining goodwill.

to . We also applied a market approach, which develops a value correlation based on the market capitalization of similar publicly traded companies, referred to as a multiple, to apply to the operating results of the reporting units. The primary market multiples used are revenue and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization. The income and market approaches were equally weighted in our most recent annual impairment test, except for PeopleScout MSP which relied only on the income approach. 
 The combined fair values for all reporting units were then reconciled to the aggregate market value of our shares of common stock on the date of valuation, while considering a reasonable control premium. We consider a reporting unit s fair value to be substantially in excess of its carrying value at a premium or greater. Based on our most recent impairment test, all of our reporting units fair values were substantially in excess of their respective carrying values, except PeopleReady. 
 As a result of our May 2024 interim impairment test, we concluded that the carrying amount of the PeopleReady reporting unit exceeded its estimated fair value. Thus, we recorded a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of million, representing the remaining goodwill balance for PeopleReady, which was included in goodwill and intangible asset impairment charge on our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss) for the thirty-nine weeks ended September 29, 2024. The goodwill impairment was primarily driven by recent performance of the PeopleReady reporting unit and the temporary industrial staffing industry since our annual impairment testing date, as well as a delay in the projected timing of recovery. 
 Additionally, following performance of the interim impairment test as of the last day of fiscal May 2024, we did not identify any events or conditions that make it more likely than not an additional impairment may have occurred. Accordingly, no further impairment charge was recognized during the thirteen or thirty-nine weeks ended September 29, 2024. 
 Indefinite-lived intangible assets 
 We held indefinite-lived trade names/trademarks of million and million as of September 29, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, related to businesses within our PeopleScout and PeopleManagement segments. 
 During the fiscal second quarter of 2024, we concluded that the carrying amount of a trade name/trademark related to the PeopleManagement segment exceeded its estimated fair value and we recorded a non-cash impairment charge of million, which was included in goodwill and intangible asset impairment charge on our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss) for the thirty-nine weeks ended September 29, 2024. The charge was primarily driven by recent revenue performance of the related business given a decline in demand and overall economic uncertainty. The remaining balance for this trade name/trademark was million as of September 29, 2024. As of our fiscal second quarter impairment test, the fair value of the trade name/trademark related to the PeopleScout segment was substantially in excess of its carrying amount of million, and therefore did not result in an impairment. 
 Additionally, following performance of the fiscal second quarter impairment test, we did not identify any additional events or conditions that make it more likely than not an additional impairment may have occurred. Accordingly, no further impairment charge was recognized during the thirteen or thirty-nine weeks ended September 29, 2024. 
 Finite-lived intangible assets 
 We did not identify any events or conditions that make it more likely than not an impairment of our finite-lived intangible assets may have occurred during the thirteen or thirty-nine weeks ended September 29, 2024.

 Our workers compensation reserve for claims below the deductible limit is discounted to its estimated net present value. The discount rates used to estimate net present value are based on average returns of risk-free U.S. Treasury instruments available during the year in which the liability was incurred and the weighted average duration of the payments against the self-insured claims. Payments made against self-insured claims are made over a weighted average period of approximately years as of September 29, 2024.

 Our workers compensation reserve includes estimated expenses related to claims above our self-insured limits excess claims ), and we record a corresponding receivable for the insurance coverage on excess claims based on the contractual policy agreements we have with insurance carriers. We discount this reserve and corresponding receivable to its estimated net present value using the discount rates based on average returns of risk-free U.S. Treasury instruments available during the year in which the liability was incurred and the weighted average duration of the payments against the excess claims. The claim payments are made and the corresponding reimbursements from our insurance carriers are received over an estimated weighted average period of approximately years. The rates used to discount excess claims incurred during the thirty-nine weeks ended September 29, 2024 and fifty-three weeks ended December 31, 2023 were and , respectively. The discounted workers compensation reserve for excess claims was million and million as of September 29, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The discounted receivables from insurance companies, net of valuation allowance, were million and million as of September 29, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.

 BUSINESS OVERVIEW 
 TrueBlue, Inc. (the company, TrueBlue, we, us and our is a leading provider of specialized workforce solutions that help our clients improve productivity and grow their businesses. Client demand for contingent workforce solutions and outsourced recruiting services is cyclical and dependent on the overall strength of the economy and labor market, as well as trends in workforce flexibility. During periods of rising economic uncertainty, clients reduce their contingent labor in response to lower volumes and reduced appetite for expanding production or inventory, which reduces the demand for our services. That environment also reduces demand for permanent placement recruiting, whether outsourced or in-house. However, as the economy emerges from periods of uncertainty, contingent labor providers are uniquely positioned to respond quickly to increasing demand for labor and rapidly fill new or temporary positions, replace absent employees, and convert fixed labor costs to variable costs. Similarly, companies turn to hybrid or fully outsourced recruiting models during periods of rapid re-hiring and high employee turnover. Our business strategy is focused on growth in each of our business segments by accelerating our digital transformation, expanding in attractive end markets and simplifying our organizational structure, which will enable us to capture market share, deliver more sustainable growth, and enhance our long-term profitability. 
 PeopleReady 
 PeopleReady provides clients with dependable access to qualified associates for their on-demand, contingent general and skilled labor needs to supplement their permanent workforce. Our services range from providing one associate to hundreds, and are generally short-term in nature as they are filling the contingent staffing needs of our clients. PeopleReady connects people with work in a broad range of industries through our network of branches across all 50 states in the United States U.S. and Puerto Rico. Our local presence is digitally enabled by our industry-leading mobile app, JobStack , which connects people with work 24 hours a day, seven days a week. JobStack creates a digital exchange between our associates and clients, competitively differentiates us, and allows our branch resources to expand their sales, recruiting and service delivery efforts. Our primary focus at PeopleReady is the continued development of our new, proprietary version of the JobStack app, and expansion in attractive end markets, including renewable energy.

 Fiscal third quarter of 2024 summary 
 Total company revenue declined 19.2 to 382.4 million for the thirteen weeks ended September 29, 2024, compared to the same period in the prior year. Demand for temporary labor and permanent hiring continues to be suppressed, as clients focus on reducing operating costs and remain uncertain about future workforce needs. 
 Total company gross profit as a percentage of revenue for the thirteen weeks ended September 29, 2024 remained flat at 26.2 , compared to the same period in the prior year. Changes in revenue mix towards our lower margin staffing businesses and pricing pressures were offset by lower workers compensation costs resulting from favorable development of prior year reserves. 
 Total company selling, general and administrative SG A expense decreased 17.2 to 100.0 million for the thirteen weeks ended September 29, 2024, compared to the same period in the prior year. SG A expense decreased as a result of continued operational cost management actions in response to the decline in demand for our services, and simplification of our organizational structure in line with our strategic plan. 
 The items above resulted in a net loss of 7.6 million for the thirteen weeks ended September 29, 2024, compared to a net loss of 0.0 million for the same period in the prior year. 
 As of September 29, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of 14.5 million, no debt, and 132.5 million available under the most restrictive covenant of our revolving credit agreement Revolving Credit Facility ), for total liquidity of 147.0 million.

 Total company revenue declined 19.2 to 382.4 million for the thirteen weeks ended September 29, 2024, and declined 16.5 to 1,181.4 million for the thirty-nine weeks ended September 29, 2024, compared to the same periods in the prior year. Demand for temporary labor and permanent hiring continues to be suppressed, as clients are hesitant to make staffing decisions due to uncertainty around future workforce needs and are utilizing their existing workforce to reduce operating costs. 
 PeopleReady 
 PeopleReady revenue declined 24.2 to 214.8 million for the thirteen weeks ended September 29, 2024, and declined 18.5 to 660.9 million for the thirty-nine weeks ended September 29, 2024, compared to the same periods in the prior year. PeopleReady revenue declined as a result of continued labor market uncertainty, leading our clients to reduce their dependence on contingent labor to supplement their core workforce. Declines in demand were seen across most industries and geographies. For the thirteen weeks ended September 29, 2024, revenue from clients in the renewable energy industry declined due to project delays caused by weather and other external factors. However, increased demand from clients in the renewable energy industry for the thirty-nine weeks ended September 29, 2024 helped partially offset demand declines in other industries.

 MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 

PeopleScout 
 PeopleScout revenue declined 30.7 to 36.7 million for the thirteen weeks ended September 29, 2024, and declined 31.9 to 124.1 million for the thirty-nine weeks ended September 29, 2024, compared to the same periods in the prior year. PeopleScout revenue declined as clients are experiencing less employee turnover, and labor market conditions are leading to uncertainty around future workforce needs. This has resulted in clients reducing hiring volumes, sourcing candidates with internal resources, and initiating hiring freezes to control costs. Revenue for the current year periods were also impacted by the loss of a large hospitality client due to their decision to insource hiring for high-volume roles. 
 PeopleManagement 
 PeopleManagement revenue declined 4.5 to 130.9 million for the thirteen weeks ended September 29, 2024, and declined 5.8 to 396.5 million for the thirty-nine weeks ended September 29, 2024, compared to the same periods in the prior year. PeopleManagement revenue declined as clients in our on-site business continue to be hesitant to make significant changes to their workforce strategies after taking steps to reduce their dependence on variable labor, primarily within the retail industry. These declines were partially offset by growth within our commercial driving business. 
 Gross profit 
 Thirteen weeks ended 
 Thirty-nine weeks ended 
 (in thousands, except percentages) Sep 29, 2024 Sep 24, 2023 Sep 29, 2024 Sep 24, 2023 Gross profit 100,037 124,173 303,846 377,777 Percentage of revenue 26.2 26.2 25.7 26.7 
 Gross profit as a percentage of revenue remained flat at 26.2 for the thirteen weeks ended September 29, 2024, compared to the same period in the prior year. Changes in revenue mix resulted in a contraction of 80 basis points, driven in part by revenue shifts toward our lower margin staffing businesses. Our staffing businesses contributed an additional 60 basis points of contraction as a result of pricing pressure typical of a low demand environment. These contractions were offset by 140 basis points of expansion from lower workers compensation costs driven by favorable development of prior year reserves. 
 Gross profit as a percentage of revenue declined 100 basis points to 25.7 for the thirty-nine weeks ended September 29, 2024, compared to 26.7 for the same period in the prior year. Changes in revenue mix resulted in a contraction of 130 basis points driven by revenue growth from renewable energy clients within PeopleReady, which have lower margins than average PeopleReady clients due to pass-through travel costs, as well as the decline in revenue in our highest margin business, PeopleScout. Our staffing businesses contributed an additional 30 basis points of contraction as a result of pricing pressure typical of a low demand environment. These contractions were partially offset by 40 basis points of expansion from lower workers compensation costs driven by favorable development of prior year reserves, as well as 20 basis points of expansion from recognition of certain COVID-19 government subsidies in the current year.

We have continued to execute operational cost management actions in response to the decline in demand for our services, and simplification of our organizational structure in line with our strategic plan. In addition, the thirty-nine weeks ended September 29, 2024 included a benefit, net of related fees, of 6.8 million for recognition of certain COVID-19 government subsidies.

Depreciation and amortization 
 Thirteen weeks ended 
 Thirty-nine weeks ended 
 (in thousands, except percentages) Sep 29, 2024 Sep 24, 2023 Sep 29, 2024 Sep 24, 2023 Depreciation and amortization 6,967 6,184 22,616 18,875 Percentage of revenue 1.8 1.3 1.9 1.3 
 Depreciation and amortization increased for the thirteen weeks and thirty-nine weeks ended September 29, 2024, compared to the same periods in the prior year, due to assets placed into service at the end of 2023, primarily related to PeopleReady technology. 
 Goodwill and intangible asset impairment charge 
 A summary of the goodwill and intangible asset impairment charge for the thirty-nine weeks ended September 29, 2024, by reportable segment, is as follows: 
 (in thousands) PeopleReady PeopleScout PeopleManagement Total company Goodwill 59,074 59,074 Trade names/trademarks 
 600 600 Total 59,074 600 59,674 
 Goodwill 
 We performed an interim impairment test as of the last day of fiscal May 2024 following the determination by management that a triggering event had occurred. As a result of this impairment test, we concluded that the carrying amount of our PeopleReady reporting unit exceeded its fair value and we recorded a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of 59.1 million, which was included in goodwill and intangible asset impairment charge on our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss) for the thirty-nine weeks ended September 29, 2024. As a result of this impairment charge, the goodwill carrying value of 59.1 million for PeopleReady was fully impaired. The goodwill impairment was primarily driven by recent performance of the PeopleReady reporting unit and the temporary industrial staffing industry since our annual impairment testing date, as well as a delay in the projected timing of recovery. No further impairment charge was recognized during the thirteen weeks ended September 29, 2024. See Note 6: Goodwill and Intangible Assets , to our consolidated financial statements found in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, for additional details. 
 Indefinite-lived intangible assets 
 We performed an impairment test during our fiscal second quarter of 2024. As a result of this impairment test, we concluded that a trade name/trademark related to our PeopleManagement segment exceeded its estimated fair value and we recorded a non-cash impairment charge of 0.6 million, which was included in goodwill and intangible asset impairment charge on our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss) for the thirty-nine weeks ended September 29, 2024. The charge was primarily driven by recent revenue performance of the related business given a decline in demand and overall economic uncertainty. The remaining balance for this trade name/trademark was 2.7 million as of September 29, 2024. 
 
 Income tax expense 
 Thirteen weeks ended 
 Thirty-nine weeks ended 
 (in thousands, except percentages) Sep 29, 2024 Sep 24, 2023 Sep 29, 2024 Sep 24, 2023 Income tax expense (benefit) 1,253 (2,326) 35,532 (1,621) Effective income tax rate (19.6) 99.6 (45.3) 12.2 
 Our tax provision and our effective tax rate are subject to variation due to several factors, including variability in accurately predicting our full year pre-tax income or loss by jurisdiction, tax credits, government audit developments, changes in laws, regulations and administrative practices, valuation allowances recorded on deferred tax assets, and relative changes in expenses or losses for which tax benefits are not recognized. Additionally, our effective tax rate can be more or less volatile based on the amount of pre-tax income or loss. For example, the impact of discrete items, tax credits, and non-deductible expenses on our effective tax rate is greater when our pre-tax income or loss is lower.

 MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 

The items creating a difference between income taxes computed at the statutory federal income tax rate and income taxes reported on the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss) are as follows: 
 Thirteen weeks ended 
 Thirty-nine weeks ended 
 (in thousands, except percentages) Sep 29, 2024 Sep 24, 2023 Sep 29, 2024 Sep 24, 2023 Income (loss) before tax expense (benefit) (6,382) (2,336) (78,511) (13,243) Federal income tax expense (benefit) at statutory rate (1,340) 21.0 (491) 21.0 (16,487) 21.0 (2,781) 21.0 Increase (decrease) resulting from: State income taxes, net of federal benefit 129 (2.0) 107 (4.6) 306 (0.4) (442) 3.3 Non-deductible goodwill impairment charge 2,287 (17.3) Valuation allowance 
 1,247 (19.5) 54,021 (68.8) Hiring tax credits, net 309 (4.8) (2,895) 123.9 (2,611) 3.3 (1,594) 12.0 Non-deductible and non-taxable items (143) 2.2 542 (23.2) (339) 0.4 376 (2.8) Stock-based compensation 107 (1.7) 391 (16.7) 834 (1.1) 625 (4.7) Other, net 944 (14.8) 20 (0.8) (192) 0.3 (92) 0.7 Income tax expense (benefit) 1,253 (19.6) (2,326) 99.6 35,532 (45.3) (1,621) 12.2 
 Significant fluctuations in our effective tax rate are primarily due to changes in the valuation allowance against our U.S. federal, state and certain foreign deferred tax assets, as well as tax benefits from hiring credits and non-deductible goodwill impairment charges. 
 Based on our deferred tax asset realizability assessments performed during the thirty-nine weeks ended September 29, 2024, we recorded a valuation allowance against U.S. federal, state and certain foreign deferred tax assets. Our conclusion was driven by U.S. and foreign pre-tax losses beginning in 2023, combined with the significant non-cash goodwill impairment charge of 59.1 million recorded during the thirty-nine weeks ended September 29, 2024. 
 The federal Work Opportunity Tax Credit WOTC ), our primary hiring tax credit, is designed to encourage employers to hire workers from certain targeted groups with higher than average unemployment rates. WOTC is generally calculated as a percentage of wages over a twelve-month period up to worker maximums by targeted groups. Based on historical results and business trends, we estimate the amount of WOTC we expect to earn related to wages of the current year. However, the estimate is subject to variation because 1) a small percentage of our workers qualify for one or more of the many targeted groups; 2) the targeted groups are subject to different incentive credit rates and limitations; 3) credits fluctuate depending on economic conditions and qualified worker retention periods; and 4) state and federal offices can delay their credit certification processing and have inconsistent certification rates. We recognize an adjustment to prior year hiring tax credits if credits certified by government offices differ from original estimates. The U.S. Congress has approved the WOTC program through the end of 2025. 
 
 Segment performance 
 We evaluate performance based on segment revenue and segment profit (loss). Segment profit (loss) includes revenue, related cost of services, and ongoing operating expenses directly attributable to the reportable segment. Segment profit (loss) excludes goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges, depreciation and amortization expense, unallocated corporate general and administrative expense, interest expense, other income and expense, income taxes, and other costs and benefits not considered to be ongoing. See Note 13: Segment Information , to our consolidated financial statements found in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, for additional details on our reportable segments, as well as a reconciliation of segment profit to income (loss) before tax expense (benefit). 
 Segment profit should not be considered a measure of financial performance in isolation or as an alternative to net income (loss) on the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss) calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.

 PeopleReady segment profit declined 6.6 million and 20.3 million for the thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended September 29, 2024, and also declined as a percentage of revenue, compared to the same periods in the prior year, respectively. These declines were primarily due to the decline in revenue and the relatively high level of fixed versus variable costs within SG A expense which resulted in lower operating leverage, the effects of which were softened by our cost management actions.

 MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 

FUTURE OUTLOOK 
 The following highlights represent our operating outlook. These expectations are subject to revision as our business changes with the overall economy. As part of our strategic plan to simplify our organizational structure, create efficiencies and bring our teams closer to our clients and associates, we continue to consolidate administrative, recruiting and support costs that serve our broader commercial staffing businesses, further leverage existing systems, and refocus our team on sales efforts to deliver future growth. 
 Operating outlook 
 We expect total revenue for the fiscal fourth quarter of 2024 to decline between 24 and 18 as compared to the same period in the prior year. The decline assumes current market conditions continue, and includes a 6 headwind due to the extra week in our fiscal fourth quarter of 2023, and 1 due to the sale of Labour Ready Temporary Services, Ltd. PeopleReady Canada in early 2024. 
 We anticipate gross profit as a percentage of revenue to decline between 100 and 60 basis points for the fiscal fourth quarter of 2024, compared to the same period in the prior year, due to prior year workers compensation reserve adjustments not expected to repeat at the same level, and changes in business mix. 
 For the fiscal fourth quarter of 2024, we anticipate SG A expense to be between 98 million and 102 million, representing a decline compared to the same period in the prior year due to ongoing cost management efforts. 
 We expect basic weighted average shares outstanding to be approximately 30 million for the fiscal fourth quarter of 2024. This expectation does not include the impact of potential share repurchases. 
 Due to the valuation allowance against our U.S. federal, state and certain foreign deferred tax assets, we expect minimal income tax expense for the fiscal fourth quarter of 2024. 
 Liquidity outlook 
 We expect capital expenditures and spending for software as a service assets to be between 4 million and 8 million for the fiscal fourth 2024. Approximately 1 million relates to spending for software as a service assets.

 MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 We believe we have a strong financial position and sufficient sources of funding to meet our short- and long-term obligations. As of September 29, 2024, we had 14.5 million in cash and cash equivalents and no debt outstanding. Under the Revolving Credit Facility, 2.7 million was utilized by outstanding standby letters of credit, leaving 252.3 million unused, of which 132.5 million is available for additional borrowing after considering our most restrictive covenant. We have an option to increase the total line of credit amount under the Revolving Credit Facility from 255.0 million to 405.0 million, subject to lender approval. 
 Cash generated through our core operations is generally our primary source of liquidity. Our principal ongoing cash needs are to finance working capital, fund capital expenditures, repay outstanding Revolving Credit Facility balances, and execute share repurchases. We manage working capital through timely collection of accounts receivable, which we achieve through focused collection efforts and tightly monitoring trends in days sales outstanding. While client payment terms are generally 90 days or less, we pay our associates daily and weekly, so additional financing through the use of our Revolving Credit Facility is sometimes necessary to support working capital needs in times of revenue growth. We also manage working capital through efficient cost management and strategically timing payments of accounts payable. 
 We continue to make investments in online and mobile apps to increase the competitive differentiation of our services long-term and improve the efficiency of our service delivery model. In addition, we continue to transition our technology from on-premise software platforms to cloud-based software solutions to increase automation and the efficiency of running our business. 
 Outside of ongoing cash needed to support core operations, our insurance carriers and certain state workers compensation programs require us to collateralize a portion of our workers compensation obligation, for which they become responsible should we become insolvent. On a regular basis, these entities assess the amount of collateral they will require from us relative to our workers compensation obligation. Such amounts can increase or decrease independent of our assessments and reserves. We continue to have risk that these collateral requirements may be increased by our insurers due to our loss history and market dynamics. We generally anticipate that our collateral commitments will grow as our business grows. We pay our premiums and deposit our collateral, if required, in installments. The collateral typically takes the form of cash and cash-backed instruments, highly rated investment grade securities, letters of credit, and surety bonds. Restricted cash, cash equivalents and investments supporting our self-insured workers compensation obligation are held in a trust at the Bank of New York Mellon Trust and are used to pay workers compensation claims as they are filed. See Note 7: Workers' Compensation Insurance and Reserves , and Note 4: Restricted Cash, Cash Equivalents and Investments , to our consolidated financial statements found in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, for details on our workers compensation program as well as the restricted cash, cash equivalents and investments held in Trust. 
 We have established investment policy directives for the Trust with the first priority to preserve capital, second to ensure sufficient liquidity to pay workers compensation claims, third to diversify the investment portfolio and fourth to maximize after-tax returns. Trust investments must meet minimum acceptable quality standards. The primary investments include U.S. Treasury securities, U.S. agency debentures, U.S. agency mortgages, corporate securities and municipal securities. For those investments rated by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations the minimum ratings at time of purchase are: 
 S P Moody s Fitch Short-term rating A-1/SP-1 P-1/MIG-1 F-1 Long-term rating A A2 A 
 Total collateral commitments decreased 23.5 million during the thirty-nine-week period ended September 29, 2024, primarily due to the use of collateral to satisfy workers compensation claims. See Note 9: Commitments and Contingencies , to our consolidated financial statements found in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, for additional details on our workers compensation commitments. We continue to actively manage workers compensation cost by focusing on improving our associate safety programs, and actively control costs with our network of service providers. These actions have had a positive impact creating favorable adjustments to workers compensation liabilities recorded in the prior periods. Continued favorable adjustments to our prior year workers compensation liabilities are dependent on our ability to continue to aggressively lower accident rates and costs of our claims. Due to our progress in worker safety improvements and the resulting reduction in the frequency and severity of accident rates, we expect diminishing favorable adjustments to our workers' compensation liabilities going forward.

 MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 

Restricted cash, cash equivalents and investments also includes collateral to support our non-qualified deferred compensation plan in the form of company-owned life insurance policies. Our non-qualified deferred compensation plan is managed by a third-party service provider, and the investments backing the company-owned life insurance policies align with the amount and timing of payments based on employee elections. 
 A summary of our cash flows for each period are as follows: 
 Thirty-nine weeks ended 
 (in thousands) Sep 29, 2024 Sep 24, 2023 Net cash (used in) provided by operating activities 
 (23,189) 19,569 Net cash used in investing activities 
 (1,438) (26,556) Net cash used in financing activities (24,765) (37,329) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash and cash equivalents 
 (638) (757) Net change in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash and cash equivalents 
 (50,030) (45,073) 
 Cash flows from operating activities 
 Operating cash flows consist of net income (loss) adjusted for non-cash benefits and expenses, and changes in operating assets and liabilities. 
 As client demand declines, the result is a deleveraging of accounts receivable and accounts payable. Accrued wages and benefits can fluctuate based on whether the period end requires the accrual of one or two weeks of payroll, the amount and timing of bonus payments, and timing of payroll tax payments. 
 Net cash provided by accounts receivable collections through deleveraging during the thirty-nine weeks ended September 29, 2024 was partially offset by an increase in days sales outstanding of approximately seven days for the fiscal third quarter of 2024 compared to the fiscal fourth quarter of 2023, primarily due to a higher percentage of receivables with longer payment terms. Net cash used for payments on accounts payable and accrued expenses was primarily related to timing of payments to vendors as well as a decrease in certain accrued expenses that fluctuate with revenue. In addition, our workers compensation claims reserve for estimated claims decreases as contingent labor services decline, as was the case in the current period. 
 Cash flows from investing activities 
 Investing cash flows consist of capital expenditures, net proceeds from divestiture, and purchases, sales, and maturities of restricted investments, which are managed in line with our workers compensation collateral funding requirements and timing of claim payments. 
 Capital expenditures for the thirty-nine weeks ended September 29, 2024 included continued investments to upgrade our PeopleReady technology platform. Our capital expenditures were partially offset by proceeds from the divestiture of PeopleReady Canada, net of transaction costs, as well as cash provided by maturities of restricted investments to pay workers compensation claims exceeding purchases of new restricted investments. 
 Cash flows from financing activities 
 Financing cash flows consist primarily of repurchases of common stock as part of our publicly announced share repurchase program, amounts to satisfy employee tax withholding obligations upon the vesting of restricted stock, the net change in our Revolving Credit Facility, and proceeds from the sale of common stock through our employee stock purchase plan. 
 Net cash used in financing activities during the thirty-nine weeks ended September 29, 2024 was primarily due to the repurchase of 21.3 million of our common stock in the open market. As of September 29, 2024, 33.5 million remains available for repurchase under existing authorizations, though we are limited to 25.0 million in aggregate share repurchases in any twelve-month period by our financial covenants. 
 
 SUMMARY OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES 
 Our critical accounting estimates are discussed in Part II, Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations; Summary of Critical Accounting Estimates in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. The following has been updated to reflect the result of our interim goodwill impairment analysis.

Table of Contents 
 
 MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 

Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets 
 We evaluate goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis as of the first day of our fiscal second quarter, or whenever events or circumstances make it more likely than not that an impairment may have occurred. These events or circumstances could include a significant change in general economic conditions, deterioration in industry environment, changes in cost factors, declining operating performance indicators, legal factors, competition, client engagement, changes in the carrying amount of net assets, sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit, or a sustained decrease in stock price. We monitor the existence of potential impairment indicators throughout the fiscal year. 
 Goodwill 
 We test for goodwill impairment at the reporting unit level. We consider our operating segments to be our reporting units for goodwill impairment testing. Our reporting units with remaining goodwill as of the first day of our fiscal second quarter were PeopleReady, Centerline, PeopleScout RPO and PeopleScout MSP. 
 When evaluating goodwill for impairment, we may first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. Qualitative factors include economic conditions, industry and market conditions and overall company financial performance. If, after assessing the totality of events and circumstances, we determine that it is more likely than not the fair value of the reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount, the quantitative impairment test is unnecessary. 
 The quantitative impairment test, if necessary, involves comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. Fair value reflects the price a market participant would be willing to pay in a potential sale of the reporting unit. If the fair value exceeds the carrying value, we conclude that no goodwill impairment has occurred. If the carrying value exceeds the fair value, we recognize an impairment charge in an amount equal to the excess, not to exceed the carrying value of the goodwill. We consider a reporting unit s fair value to be substantially in excess of its carrying value at a 20 premium or greater. 
 Determining the fair value of a reporting unit when performing a quantitative impairment test involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions to evaluate the impact of operational and economic changes on each reporting unit. We estimate the fair value using a weighting of the income and market valuation approaches. The income approach applies a fair value methodology to each reporting unit based on discounted cash flows. This analysis requires significant estimates and judgments, including estimation of future cash flows, which is dependent on internal forecasts, estimation of the long-term rate of growth for our business, estimation of the useful life over which cash flows will occur, and determination of our weighted average cost of capital, which is risk-adjusted to reflect the specific risk profile of the reporting unit being tested. We also apply a market approach, which develops a value correlation based on the market capitalization of similar publicly traded companies, referred to as a multiple, to apply to the operating results of the reporting units. The primary market multiples to which we compare are revenue and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization. 
 We base fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain. Actual future results may differ from those estimates. We confirm the reasonableness of the valuation conclusions by comparing the indicated values of all the reporting units to the overall company value indicated by the stock price and outstanding shares as of the valuation date, or market capitalization. 
 Impairment test 
 During the fiscal second quarter of 2024, management determined that a triggering event had occurred as a result of additional decline in demand for our services, prolonged economic uncertainty, and a further decrease in our stock price. Therefore, we performed an interim impairment test as of the last day of fiscal May 2024. The weighted average cost of capital used in our most recent impairment test was risk-adjusted to reflect the specific risk profile of the reporting units and ranged from 13.5 to 14.5 . The combined fair values for all reporting units were then reconciled to the aggregate market value of our shares of common stock on the date of valuation.

 MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 

Based on the results of our interim impairment test, we concluded that the carrying amount of goodwill for the PeopleReady reporting unit exceeded the estimated fair value and we recorded a non-cash impairment charge of 59.1 million, which was included in goodwill and intangible asset impairment charge on our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss) for the thirty-nine weeks ended September 29, 2024. As a result of this impairment charge, the total goodwill carrying value of 59.1 million for PeopleReady was fully impaired. The goodwill impairment was primarily driven by recent performance of the PeopleReady reporting unit and the temporary industrial staffing industry since our annual impairment testing date, as well as a delay in the projected timing of recovery. Based on our interim impairment test, we concluded the fair values of all other reporting units were substantially in excess of their carrying values, and the goodwill associated with those reporting units was not impaired. 
 Additionally, following performance of the interim impairment test, we did not identify any events or conditions that make it more likely than not an additional impairment may have occurred during the thirteen or thirty-nine weeks ended September 29, 2024. 
 Indefinite-lived intangible assets 
 We have indefinite-lived intangible assets for trade names/trademarks related to business within our PeopleManagement and PeopleScout segments. We evaluate our indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis as of the first day of our fiscal second quarter, or whenever events or circumstances make it more likely than not that an impairment may have occurred. These events or circumstances could include significant change in general economic conditions, deterioration in industry environment, changes in cost factors, declining operating performance indicators, legal factors, competition, client engagement, or sale or disposition of a significant portion of the business. We monitor the existence of potential impairment indicators throughout the fiscal year. 
 When evaluating indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment, we may first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount. Qualitative factors include macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions and overall company financial performance. If, after assessing the totality of events and circumstances, we determine that it is more likely than not the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset is greater than its carrying amount, the quantitative impairment test is unnecessary. 
 The quantitative impairment test, if necessary, utilizes the relief from royalty method to determine the fair value of each of our trade names/trademarks. If the carrying value exceeds the fair value, we recognize an impairment charge in an amount equal to the excess, not to exceed the carrying value. Management uses considerable judgment to determine key assumptions, including projected revenue, royalty rates and appropriate discount rates. 
 Impairment test 
 We performed an indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment test during our fiscal second quarter of 2024. As a result of this impairment test, we concluded that a trade name/trademark related to the PeopleManagement segment exceeded its estimated fair value and we recorded a non-cash impairment charge of 0.6 million, which was included in goodwill and intangible asset impairment charge on our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss) for the thirty-nine weeks ended September 29, 2024. The charge was primarily driven by recent revenue performance of the related business given a decline in demand and overall economic uncertainty. The remaining balance for this trade name/trademark was 2.7 million as of September 29, 2024. As of our impairment testing date, the fair value of the trade name/trademark related to the PeopleScout segment was substantially in excess of its carrying amount of 2.1 million, and therefore did not result in an impairment. 
 Additionally, following performance of the impairment test, we did not identify any events or conditions that make it more likely than not a further impairment may have occurred during the thirteen or thirty-nine weeks ended September 29, 2024.

 MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 

Income taxes and related valuation allowances 
 We account for income taxes by recording taxes payable or receivable for the current year and deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. These expected future tax consequences are measured based on provisions of tax law as currently enacted; the effects of future changes in tax laws are not anticipated. We recognize deferred tax assets to the extent we believe it is more likely than not the asset will be realized. We consider available positive and negative evidence when making such determination, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax-planning strategies, carryback potential if permitted, and results of recent operations. When appropriate, we record a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. 
 Interim periods 
 Our income tax provision for interim periods is determined using an estimate of our annual effective tax rate, adjusted for any discrete items that are taken into account in the relevant period. Each quarter we update our estimate of the annual effective tax rate and, if our estimated tax rate changes, we make a cumulative adjustment. Our quarterly tax provision and quarterly estimate of our annual effective tax rate are subject to variation due to several factors, including variability in accurately predicting our full year pre-tax income or loss by jurisdiction, tax credits, government audit developments, changes in laws, regulations and administrative practices, valuation allowances recorded on deferred tax assets, and relative changes in expenses or losses for which tax benefits are not recognized. Additionally, our effective tax rate can be more or less volatile based on the amount of pre-tax income or loss. For example, the impact of discrete items, tax credits, and non-deductible expenses on our effective tax rate is greater when our pre-tax income or loss is lower. 
 Quarterly, management assesses the available positive and negative evidence to estimate whether sufficient future taxable income will be generated to permit the use of existing deferred tax assets, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected taxable income, tax-planning strategies, carryback potential if permitted, and the results of recent operations. A significant piece of objective negative evidence is the existence of a three-year cumulative loss. Such objective negative evidence limits the ability of management to consider other subjective evidence, such as projected taxable income. 
 Based on our interim deferred tax asset realizability assessments, we determined that a valuation allowance was appropriate against our U.S. federal, state and certain foreign deferred tax assets as of September 29, 2024.
