In accordance with Rules 3-09 and 4-08(g) of Regulation S-X, the Company must determine if any of its portfolio companies is considered a significant subsidiary. Pursuant to the definition of significant subsidiary applicable to investment companies set forth in Rule 1-02(w) of Regulation S-X, a portfolio company will meet the definition of significant subsidiary if either the investment test or the income test is triggered. Rule 3-09 of Regulation S-X requires the Company to include separate audited financial statements of any unconsolidated majority-owned subsidiary (portfolio company in which the Company owns greater than of the unconsolidated subsidiary) in the Company's annual report on Form 10-K if one of the following conditions are met: (i) if the portfolio investment s fair value exceeds of the Company s total investments at fair value (the investment test); or (ii) either (A) if the income from the portfolio investment exceeds of the Company s absolute value of the change in net assets from operations of the Company and its subsidiaries (the income test) or (B) if the income from the portfolio investment exceeds of the Company s absolute value of the change in net assets from operations of the Company and its subsidiaries and have a fair value exceeding of the Company s total investment fair value (the alternate income test). If the Company has an unconsolidated majority-owned subsidiary and does not satisfy any Rule 3-09 significant subsidiary conditions during a quarter end, the Company must include a summarized income statement within the notes to the quarterly financial statements. Rule 4-08(g) of Regulation S-X requires the Company to include summarized financial information of any unconsolidated controlled subsidiary (portfolio company in which the Company owns greater than of the voting securities of the unconsolidated subsidiary or otherwise controls the subsidiary) in the Company's annual report on Form 10-K if one of the following conditions are met: (i) if the portfolio investment s fair value exceeds of the Company s total investments fair value (the investment test); or (ii) either (A) if the income from the portfolio investment exceeds of the Company s absolute value of the change in net assets from operations of the Company and its subsidiaries (the income test) or (B) if the income from the portfolio investment income exceeds of the Company s absolute value of the change in net assets from operations of the Company and its subsidiaries and have a fair value exceeding of the Company s total investment fair value (the alternate income test). After performing the investment analysis and income analysis for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , the Company determined that the fair value of the SDLP represented greater than of the Company's total investments (at fair value) and also generated more

The Company conducts a review of the fair value hierarchy classifications on a quarterly basis. The Company monitors the availability of observable market data to assess the appropriate classification of financial instruments within the fair value hierarchy. Changes in the observability of valuation inputs may result in a reclassification for certain financial assets or liabilities. Changes in economic conditions or model based valuation techniques may require the transfer of financial instruments from one fair value level to another. Reclassifications impacting Level 3 of the fair value hierarc hy are reported as transfers in/out of the Level 3 category as of the beginning of the quarter in which the reclassifications occur. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company had investments transferred in/out of the Level 3 category. For the year ended December 31, 2023, there were investments transferred out of Level 3 however, the Company had two equity investments with an aggregate fair value of million transfer from being measured at NAV to Level 3 as a result of changes in the observability of significant inputs.

 , the Company entered into an investment advisory agreement with the Adviser. In connection with the Transaction, the Company entered into a new investment agreement between the Company and the Adviser (the "Prior Investment Advisory Agreement"), which became effective on September 6, 2023. The Prior Investment Advisory Agreement was materially identical to the investment advisory agreement, dated June 2, 2022. At a meeting of the Company s shareholders held on June 12, 2024, the Company s shareholders voted to approve an amended investment advisory agreement by and between the Company and the Adviser (the Investment Advisory Agreement ). Pursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement, the Company pays the Adviser a fee for its investment advisory and management services consisting of two components a base management fee and an incentive fee. The cost of both the base management fee and the incentive fee will ultimately be borne by the shareholders. The Investment Advisory Agreement amended the Prior Investment Advisory Agreement as follows: (i) Reduced the incentive fee payable by the Company to the Adviser following an initial public offering or a listing of the common stock on a national securities exchange (a "Public Listing") from of all remaining Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income (as defined below) above the catch-up to of all remaining Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income above the catch-up and 

 (ii) More accurately reflect the original intent of the parties with respect to the three-year look back by revising the description of the calculation of the Income Incentive Fee (as defined below) to more explicitly account for the three-year look back and specifically referring to the aggregate Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income for the Trailing Twelve Quarters (as defined below) in the description of the calculation; therefore, the foregoing change is clarifying in nature and neither reflects a change in the actual calculation of the Income Incentive Fee nor would result in any change in the fees payable by the Adviser. 

 Other than the foregoing, no other material provisions of the Prior Investment Advisory Agreement changed. Base Management Fee Pursuant to the Amended Investment Advisory Agreement, prior to a Public Listing, the Company pays to the Adviser a fee (the Management Fee for management services in an amount equal to an annual rate of of the Company's "Adjusted Gross Assets". The Company's Adjusted Gross Assets is the average of the accreted or amortized cost basis of the Company's portfolio investments, excluding cash and cash equivalents and undrawn capital commitments at the end of the two most recently completed fiscal quarters (and, in the case of the first quarter-end following the Initial Closing, at the end of such fiscal quarter-end). The Management Fee is payable quarterly in arrears. Pursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement, beginning with the first full calendar quarter following Public Listing, the Company will pay to the Adviser the Management Fee in an amount equal to an annual rate of of the Adjusted Gross Assets payable quarterly in arrears (and, in the case of the first full calendar quarter-end following a Public Listing, at the end of such fiscal quarter-end). For the three months ended September 30, 2024 , the Company incurred base management fees to the Adviser of million.

 (iii) of the Company s remaining aggregate Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income in respect of the relevant Trailing Twelve Quarters, if any, that exceeds the catch-up . 

 Beginning with the first full calendar quarter following a Public Listing, under the Investment Advisory Agreement, the Income Incentive Fee will be calculated, subject to the Incentive Fee Cap, and payable quarterly in arrears in respect of the Trailing Twelve Quarters as follows: (i) no incentive fee in any calendar quarter in which the Company s aggregate Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income in respect of the relevant Trailing Twelve Quarters does not exceed the hurdle rate of for such Trailing Twelve Quarters; 

 (ii) of the excess of the Company s Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income in respect of the relevant Trailing Twelve Quarters with respect to that portion of such Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income, if any, that exceeds the hurdle rate until the Adviser has received a catch-up equal to of the aggregate Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income in respect of the relevant Trailing Twelve Quarters; and 

 (iii) of the Company s remaining aggregate Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income in respect of the relevant Trailing Twelve Quarters, if any, that exceeds the catch-up . 

 Pre-incentive fee net investment income means interest income, dividend income, accrued interest on the Subordinated Certificates, and any other income including any other fees (other than fees for providing managerial assistance), such as commitment, origination, structuring, diligence and consulting fees or other fees that the Company receives from portfolio companies accrued during the quarter, minus its operating expenses for the quarter including the Management Fee, expenses payable under the Administration Agreement (as defined below), and any interest expense and any dividends paid on any issued and outstanding preferred stock, but excluding the Income Incentive Fee. Pre-incentive fee net investment income includes, in the case of investments with a deferred interest feature (such as original issue discount, debt instruments with PIK interest and zero coupon securities), accrued income that we have not yet received in cash. Pre-incentive fee net investment income does not include any realized capital gains, realized capital losses or unrealized capital appreciation or depreciation. The Income Incentive Fee for a particular quarter is subject to a cap (the "Incentive Fee Cap ). For periods prior to a Public Listing, the Incentive Fee Cap is equal to the difference between (x) of the Cumulative Net Return (as defined below) from the calendar quarter then ending and the eleven preceding calendar quarters (such period the Trailing Twelve Quarters and (y) the aggregate Income Incentive Fees that were paid to the Adviser by the Company in respect of the first eleven calendar quarters (or the portion thereof) included in the relevant Trailing Twelve Quarters. Following a Public Listing, the Incentive Fee Cap will be equal to the difference between (x) of the Cumulative Net Return during the relevant Trailing Twelve Quarters and (y) the aggregate Income Incentive Fees that were paid to the Adviser by the Company in respect of the first eleven calendar quarters (or the portion thereof) included in the relevant Trailing Twelve Quarters. Cumulative Net Return is defined as the sum of (a) pre-incentive fee net investment income in respect of the relevant Trailing Twelve Quarters and (b) cumulative aggregate realized capital gains, cumulative aggregate

Beginning with the first full calendar quarter following a Public Listing, the Capital Gains Incentive Fee will be equal to of the Company s realized capital gains, if any, on a cumulative basis from inception through the end of the fiscal year, computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation on a cumulative basis, less the aggregate amount of any previously paid capital gains incentive fees.

The Company will be required to distribute dividends each tax year as a RIC to its shareholders of an amount generally at least equal to of its investment company taxable income, determined without regard to any deduction for dividends paid, in order to be eligible for tax benefits allowed to a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. The Company anticipates paying out as a distribution all or substantially all of those amounts. The amount to be paid out as a dividend is determined by the Board and is based on management s estimate of the Company s annual taxable income. Net realized capital gains, if any, are generally distributed, although the Company may decide to retain such net realized capital gains for investment. The Company has adopted an opt out distribution reinvestment plan DRIP for shareholders. As a result, if the Board authorizes, and the Company declares, a dividend or other distribution, each shareholder that has not opted out of the DRIP will have their dividends or distributions automatically reinvested in additional shares of our common stock rather than receiving cash distributions. Shareholders who receive distributions in the form of shares of common stock will be subject to the same U.S. federal, state and local tax consequences as if they received cash distributions.

 of its investment company taxable income, as defined by the Code, each year. The Company is subject to a nondeductible U.S. federal excise tax on its undistributed income, unless it timely distributes (or is deemed to have timely distributed) an amount equal to the sum of (1) 98 of ordinary income for each calendar year, (2) 98.2 of the amount by which capital gains exceeds capital losses (adjusted for certain ordinary losses) for a one-year period ending on October 31 of the calendar year, and (3) any income and gains recognized, but not distributed, from the previous years. While the Company intends to distribute any income and capital gains to avoid imposition of this 4 U.S. federal excise tax, it may not be successful in avoiding entirely the imposition of this tax. In that case, the Company will be liable for the tax only on the amount by which it does not meet the foregoing distribution requirement. As of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, the Company did not record a U.S. federal income tax expense/(benefit). Taxable Subsidiaries The Company uses the liability method to account for its taxable subsidiary's, VCCEH, income taxes. Using this method, the Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the estimated future tax effects attributable to temporary differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities. In addition, the Company recognizes deferred tax benefits associated with net operating loss carry forwards that it may use to offset future tax obligations. The Company measures deferred tax assets and liabilities using the enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which it expects to recover or settle those temporary differences. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and the year ended December 2023 , the Company determined that deferred tax asset or liability was necessary. The Company evaluates tax positions taken in the course of preparing the Company s tax returns to determine whether the tax positions are more-likely-than-not to be sustained by the applicable tax authority in accordance with ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes ASC 740 ). Tax benefits of positions not deemed to meet the more-likely-than-not threshold, or uncertain tax positions, would be recorded as tax expense in the current year. It is the Company s policy to recognize accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax benefits in income tax expense. The Company had no uncertain tax positions as of and through September 30, 2024. Federal Income Taxes The Company is subject to the U.S. federal income tax rules and filing requirements. The Company is expected to have minimal or no income subject to tax and therefore no provision has been included for taxes due. The Company has elected, and intends to qualify annually, to be treated as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. As a result, the Company generally does not expect to be subject to U.S. federal income taxes. In the normal course of business, the Company is subject to examination by federal and certain state and local tax regulators. The Company's federal tax returns are generally subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service for a period of three years after they are filed.

 Overview 
 We were formed on July 31, 2019 as a corporation under the laws of Maryland. We are an externally managed, non-diversified closed-end management investment company that has elected to be regulated as a BDC under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the 1940 Act ). In addition, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the Company has elected, and intends to qualify annually, to be treated as a RIC under the Code. The Company s fiscal year end is December 31. 
 The Adviser serves as the Company s investment adviser. The Adviser is registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (the Advisers Act ), and is a subsidiary of Varagon, which is also registered with the SEC as an investment adviser under the Advisers Act. Subject to the overall supervision of the Company s board of directors (the Board ), the Adviser manages the day-to-day operation of and provides investment advisory and management services to the Company. 
 The Company s investment objective is to generate current income with a focus on capital preservation and, to a lesser extent, capital appreciation by investing primarily in directly originated leveraged loans to U.S. middle market companies. 
 The Company intends to achieve its investment objective by investing primarily in senior secured loans to performing middle market companies controlled by private equity sponsors. The Company focuses on loans to middle market companies that have sustainable competitive advantages, experienced management teams, solid financial performance, stable and recurring cash flow and strong enterprise value. The Company expects that such companies and their sponsors will require financing from the Company for growth, acquisitions, recapitalizations, refinancings or leveraged buyouts, among other things. The Company generally expects to invest in companies with EBITDA between 10 million and 75 million annually, though we may invest in smaller or larger companies if an attractive opportunity presents itself. The Company also generally intends to directly originate its investments as a lead lender to allow for deeper diligence, greater control over terms and structure, and superior economics. 
 The Company has a wholly owned subsidiary, VCC Equity Holdings, LLC ("VCCEH ), that is taxed as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes. VCCEH was formed to hold equity securities of portfolio companies organized as pass-through entities while continuing to satisfy the requirements of a RIC under the Code, and the assets held by VCCEH are pledged as collateral supporting the amounts outstanding under the CIBC Facility (as discussed below). VCCEH also guarantees the borrowings outstanding under the SMBC Facility (as defined below) (See "Note 6. Borrowings"). In addition, the Company has three other wholly owned subsidiaries, VCC Funding, LLC ("VCCF"), a bankruptcy remote special purpose entity, whose assets are pledged as collateral supporting the amounts outstanding under the JPM Facility (as discussed below), Varagon SDLP, LLC VSDLP ), which holds the Company's interest in the SDLP (as defined below), and VCC CLO 1 Depositor, LLC ("VCC CLO Depositor"), which in turn wholly owns VCC CLO 1, LLC ("VCC CLO"). VCC CLO Depositor and VCC CLO were formed for the purpose of issuing a term debt securitization. VCCEH, VCCF, VSDLP, and VCC CLO Depositor are each direct wholly owned subsidiaries of the Company and VCC CLO is an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, and as such are consolidated in the Company's consolidated financial statements commencing from June 2, 2022, the commencement of investment operations, or the date of their respective formation, in accordance with the Company s consolidation policy. 
 On March 29, 2022, in connection with its seed audit, the Company issued 100 shares of the Company's common stock for 10.00 to Varagon, which were subsequently redeemed on June 2, 2022, in connection with the Merger (as described below). On June 2, 2022, Varagon Fund I, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership and a private fund exempt from registration pursuant to Section 3(c)(7) of the 1940 Act VF1 ), merged with and into the Company (the Merger ), with the Company continuing as the surviving entity. As a result of the Merger, the Company acquired all of VF1 s assets and liabilities (the Existing Portfolio ), including all of VF1 s interests in the joint venture, Senior Direct Lending Program SDLP ), in exchange for shares of the Company s common stock. Accordingly, the Company received 40.9 million in cash and 145.2 million in investments at fair value, which consisted of a non-cash purchase of a 142.1 million investment and 3.1 million of total accumulated earnings. In addition, 191.3 million of VF1 investor commitments were converted into capital commitments to the Company (of which, 185.5 million was funded). In addition, the Company issued 18.6 
 63 

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

 million of shares of common stock at 10.00 per share to the limited partners of VF1 in exchange for the assets and liabilities of VF1. Additionally, on June 2, 2022, the Company received 296.9 million of capital commitments (of which, 175.2 million was funded) (the Initial Closing and the Company issued 17.5 million shares of common stock at 10.00 per share to new investors. The Company also became the sole member of its wholly owned subsidiaries VCCF and VSDLP. On June 2, 2022, immediately prior to its election to be regulated as a BDC, the Company purchased a portfolio of existing loans for 449.4 million (the Warehoused Portfolio and together with the Existing Portfolio, the Initial Portfolio from certain affiliates of the Adviser using proceeds from the Initial Closing and borrowings under the JPM Facility pursuant to loan sale and purchase agreements. In connection with the purchase of the Initial Portfolio, the Board reviewed and approved the fair value of the Initial Portfolio based on the Adviser s internal analysis and input from third-party valuation firms. 
 Varagon Transaction with Man Group plc 
 On July 5, 2023, Varagon entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the Merger Agreement with affiliates of Man Group plc Man Group ), pursuant to which a newly formed indirect subsidiary of Man Group merged with and into Varagon, with Varagon surviving the merger as an indirect subsidiary of Man Group (the Transaction ). The Transaction closed on September 6, 2023. As a result, following the Transaction, Man Group owns a majority interest in Varagon and Varagon management continues to own, directly or indirectly, a minority interest in Varagon. Although the ownership of Varagon changed as a result of the Transaction, there were no material changes to the investment advisory or administrative services performed by the Adviser or Varagon in its capacity as the Company s administrator. 
 Key Components of Our Results of Operations 
 Investments 
 We focus primarily on the direct origination and syndication of loans to middle market companies domiciled in the United States. 
 Our level of investment activity (both the number of investments and the size of each investment) varies substantially from period to period depending on many factors, including the amount of debt and equity capital generally available to middle market companies, the level of merger and acquisition activity for such companies, the general economic environment and the competitive environment for the types of investments we make. Based on current market conditions, the pace of our investment activities, including originations and repayments, may vary. The historic strength of the financing and mergers and acquisitions markets and the historically low interest rate environment previously led to increased originations and repayments. However, there have been headwinds in the financing and merger and acquisitions markets resulting from inflation, supply chain disruptions, labor and resource shortages, commodity inflation, a shifting interest rate environment, geopolitical events (including the war in Ukraine, conflict in the Middle East, and U.S. and China relations), and the uncertain economic outlook for the United States and globally, which could include a recession. We are closely monitoring the effect that market volatility, including as a result of the elevated interest rate environment, may have on our portfolio companies and our investment activities, and we will continue to seek to invest in defensive businesses with low levels of cyclicality and strong levels of free cash flow generation. 
 As a BDC, we may not acquire any assets other than qualifying assets specified in Section 55(a) of the 1940 Act, unless, at the time the acquisition is made, at least 70 of our total assets are qualifying assets (with certain limited exceptions). Qualifying assets include securities of private or thinly traded public U.S. companies, cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities and high-quality debt investments that mature in one year or less. Qualifying assets include investments in eligible portfolio companies , which, under the 1940 Act, includes all private companies, companies whose securities are not listed on a national securities exchange, and certain public companies whose securities are listed on a national securities exchange but whose market capitalization is less than 250 million. In addition, we must be organized in the United States to qualify as a BDC. 
 Revenues 
 We plan to generate revenues in the form of interest income from the debt securities we hold and dividends and capital appreciation on either direct equity investments or equity interests obtained in connection with originating loans, such as options, warrants or conversion rights. The debt we invest in typically will not be rated by any rating agency, but if it were, it is likely that such debt would be below investment grade. Our investment bias will be toward adjustable-rate senior secured loans. We do not anticipate a secondary market to develop for our private investments. We expect most of our investments to be in corporations, partnerships, limited liability companies or other business entities, including in investment vehicles that issue certificates to us. We also may generate revenue in the form of commitment, loan origination, structuring or diligence fees, fees for providing managerial assistance to our portfolio companies, repayment fees, and waiver and amendment fees associated with our portfolio investments based on our pro rata ownership of the applicable term loan investment or our interest in securities (including the subordinated certificates (the "Subordinated Certificates") issued by SDLP, a joint venture between the Company and Ares Capital Corporation ("ARCC")) related to an underlying investment, as applicable. Certain of these fees may be capitalized and amortized as additional interest income over the life of the related loan.

 Expenses 
 All professionals of the Adviser, when and to the extent engaged in providing investment advisory and management services to us, and the compensation and routine overhead expenses of personnel allocable to these services to us, will be provided and paid for by the Adviser and not by us. Payments under the Administration Agreement are based upon our allocable portion of overhead and other expenses incurred by our administrator, Varagon (in its capacity as our administrator, the "Administrator"), in performing its obligations under the Administration Agreement, including a portion of the rent and the compensation of our Chief Financial Officer and Chief Compliance Officer and their respective staffs. In accordance with the terms of the Administration Agreement, overhead and other administrative expenses are generally allocated between the Administrator and us by reference to the relative time spent by personnel in performing administrative and similar functions on our behalf as compared to performing administrative functions on behalf of the Administrator, its other clients or the Adviser. To the extent personnel retained by the Administrator perform administrative tasks for the Adviser, the fees incurred with respect to the actual time dedicated to such tasks will be reimbursed by the Adviser. We will bear all other out-of-pocket costs and expenses of our operations and transactions, including those relating to:

the expense reimbursements set forth in the Administration Agreement; and 

all other properly and reasonably chargeable expenses incurred by the Company or the Administrator in connection with administering the Company s business, including rent and the allocable portion of the cost of the Company s Chief Compliance Officer and Chief Financial Officer and their respective staffs; while certain of these expenses may not be ascertainable at any given time, any such expenses will be subject to the approval of the Board on a quarterly basis. 

Leverage 
 The ratio of a BDC's total assets (less total liabilities other than indebtedness represented by senior securities) to its total indebtedness represented by senior securities plus preferred stock, if any, must be at least 200 or 150 , if certain requirements are met. In connection with the Company s organization and the Initial Closing, the Board and its initial shareholder authorized us to adopt the 150 asset coverage ratio. Additionally, investors both consented to the minimum asset coverage ratio of 150 and agreed not to seek to redeem their shares of common stock in connection therewith, in each case in the subscription agreement. The Company therefore may be exposed, to a greater extent, to the risks of leverage, which may be considered a speculative investment technique. The use of leverage magnifies the potential for gain and loss on amounts invested and therefore increases the risks associated with investing in our securities. In any period, our interest expense will depend largely on the extent of our borrowing, and we expect interest expense will increase as we increase our debt outstanding. As of September 30, 2024, the Company's asset coverage ratio was 208.52 . 
 Portfolio and Investment Activity 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, our portfolio had a fair value of approximately 765.7 million. The following table summarizes our portfolio and investment activity during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 (dollars in thousands):

(1) "Weighted average yields of investments are computed as (a) the annual stated interest rate or yield earned plus the net annual amortization of original issue discount and market discount or premium earned on the relevant accruing investments, divided by (b) the total relevant investments at amortized cost or at fair value, as applicable. 
 The weighted average yield of our debt and income producing securities is not the same as a return on investment for our shareholders, but rather relates to our investment portfolio and is calculated before the payment of all of our and our subsidiaries fees and expenses. The weighted average yield was computed using the effective interest rates as of each respective date, including accretion of original issue discount, but excluding investments on non-accrual status, if any. There can be no assurance that the weighted average yield will remain at its current level. 
 Portfolio Asset Quality 
 Our Adviser employs an investment rating system to categorize our investments. In addition to various risk management and monitoring tools, our Adviser grades the credit risk of all debt investments on a scale of 1 to 5 no less frequently than quarterly. This system is intended primarily to reflect the underlying risk of a portfolio debt investment relative to the inherent risk at the time the original debt investment was made (i.e., at the time of acquisition), although it may also take into account under certain circumstances the performance of the portfolio company's business, the collateral coverage of the investment and other relevant factors.

2 
 
 Involves an acceptable level of risk that is similar to the risk at the time of origination or acquisition. The borrower is generally performing as expected and the risk factors are generally neutral to favorable. All investments or acquired investments in new portfolio companies are initially assessed a rating of 2. 

3 
 
 Involves a borrower performing below expectations and indicates that the loan s risk has increased somewhat since origination or acquisition. 

4

 Involves a borrower performing substantially below expectations and indicates that the loan s risk has increased substantially since origination or acquisition. Most or all of the debt covenants are out of compliance and payments are substantially delinquent. Loans rated 5 are not anticipated to be repaid in full and we will reduce the fair market value of the loan to the amount we anticipate will be recovered. 

The weighted average risk rating of our investments based on fair value was 2.0 as of September 30, 2024 and 2.0 as of December 31, 2023. 
 Based on a generally uncertain economic outlook in the United States (which includes a possible recession), we are maintaining close communications with our portfolio companies to proactively assess and manage potential risks across our debt investment portfolio. We also have increased oversight and analysis of credits in any vulnerable industries to mitigate any decline in loan performance and reduce credit risk. While we are not seeing signs of an overall, broad deterioration in our operating results or those of our portfolio companies at this time, there can be no assurance that the performance of certain of our portfolio companies will not be negatively impacted by economic conditions, which could have a negative impact on our future results. 
 The following table shows the distribution of our investments on the 1 to 5 investment performance rating scale at fair value as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 (dollars in thousands):

Loans are generally placed on non-accrual status when there is reasonable doubt that principal or interest will be collected in full. Accrued interest is generally reversed when a loan is placed on non-accrual status. Interest payments received on non-accrual loans may be recognized as income or applied to principal depending upon management s judgment regarding collectability. Non-accrual loans are restored to accrual status when past due principal and interest is paid and, in management s judgment, are likely to remain current. Management may make exceptions to this treatment and determine to not place a loan on non-accrual status if the loan has sufficient collateral value and is in the process of collection. 
 Senior Direct Lending Program 
 In 2015, VSDLP, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, and ARCC formed SDLP, a joint venture established for the purpose of providing senior stretch and unitranche loan financings to middle market borrowers. The Company received, indirectly through its membership interest in VSDLP, limited liability company membership interests and Subordinated Certificates in each case in SDLP, as a result of the Merger. The SDLP finances its investment activity through the issuance of securities SDLP Securities backed by its loan portfolio, including, in order of seniority, rated senior notes (the Senior Note ), a rated intermediate funding note (the IFN ), and capital provided by the Company and ARCC through the Subordinated Certificates. The Subordinated Certificates are the most junior securities issued by SDLP and collateralize the profits earned or losses incurred across the SDLP loan portfolio. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company and ARCC own 12.5 and 87.5 , respectively, of the outstanding Subordinated Certificates. 
 SDLP is capitalized as transactions are completed and all portfolio decisions and generally all other decisions in respect of SDLP must be approved by an investment committee of SDLP consisting of representatives of the Company (and/or VSDLP) and ARCC (the SDLP Investment Committee ). 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company and ARCC had agreed to make capital available to the SDLP totaling 1.7 billion and 1.7 billion, respectively, in the aggregate, of which 206.3 million and 206.3 million, respectively, is to be made available from the Company. The Company and ARCC will continue to provide capital to the SDLP in the form of Subordinated

 Certificates. This capital will only be committed to the SDLP upon approval of transactions by the SDLP Investment Committee as discussed above. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company has funded 182.0 million and 189.7 million, respectively, of its commitment to the SDLP and had 24.3 million and 16.6 million in unfunded commitments remaining to the SDLP, respectively. 
 The Subordinated Certificates pay a coupon equal to SOFR plus 8.0 and also entitle the holders thereof to receive a portion of the excess cash flow from the loan portfolio, after expenses, which may result in a return to the holders of the Subordinated Certificates that is greater than the stated coupon. The Subordinated Certificates are junior in right of payment to the Senior Notes and IFNs. 
 The amortized cost and fair value of the Subordinated Certificates held by the Company were 179.1 million and 173.8 million, respectively, as of September 30, 2024, and 188.5 million and 184.5 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2023. The Company s yield on its investment in the Subordinated Certificates at amortized cost and fair value was 14.5 and 15.0 , respectively, as of September 30, 2024, and 14.3 and 14.6 , respectively, as of December 31, 2023. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company earned interest income of 6.5 million and 21.5 million, respectively, from its investment in the Subordinated Certificates. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company earned interest income of 6.9 million and 19.2 million, respectively, from its investment in the Subordinated Certificates. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, 6.5 million and 6.8 million, respectively, was in Interest receivable on the consolidated statements of assets and liabilities.

In accordance with Rules 3-09 and 4-08(g) of Regulation S-X, the Company must determine if any of its portfolio companies is considered a significant subsidiary. Pursuant to the definition of significant subsidiary applicable to investment companies set forth in Rule 1-02(w) of Regulation S-X, a portfolio company will meet the definition of significant subsidiary if either the investment test or the income test is triggered. Rule 3-09 of Regulation S-X requires the Company to include separate audited financial statements of any unconsolidated majority-owned subsidiary (portfolio company in which the Company owns greater than 50 of the unconsolidated subsidiary) in the Company's annual report on Form 10-K if one of the following conditions are met: (i) if the portfolio investment s fair value exceeds 20 of the Company s total investments at fair value (the investment test); or (ii) either (A) if the income from the portfolio investment exceeds 80 of the Company s absolute value of the change in net assets from operations of the Company and its subsidiaries (the income test) or (B) if the income from the portfolio investment exceeds 20 of the Company s absolute value of the change in net assets from operations of the Company and its subsidiaries and have a fair value exceeding 5 of the Company s total investment fair value (the alternate income test). If the Company has an unconsolidated majority-owned subsidiary and does not satisfy any Rule 3-09 significant subsidiary conditions during a quarter end, the Company must include a summarized income statement within the notes to the quarterly financial statements. 
 Rule 4-08(g) of Regulation S-X requires the Company to include summarized financial information of any unconsolidated controlled subsidiary (portfolio company in which the Company owns greater than 25 of the voting securities of the unconsolidated subsidiary or otherwise controls the subsidiary) in the Company's annual report on Form 10-K if one of the following conditions are met: (i) if the portfolio investment s fair value exceeds 10 of the Company s total investments fair value (the investment test); or (ii) either (A) if the income from the portfolio investment exceeds 80 of the Company s absolute value of the change in net assets from operations of the Company and its subsidiaries (the income test) or (B) if the income from the portfolio investment income exceeds 10 of the Company s absolute value of the change in net assets from operations of the Company and its subsidiaries and have a fair value exceeding 5 of the Company s total investment fair value (the alternate income test). 
 After performing the investment analysis and income analysis for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company determined that the fair value of the SDLP represented greater than 20 of the Company's total investments (at fair value) and also

Net increase (decrease) in net assets resulting from operations can vary from period to period as a result of various factors, including the level of new investment commitments, expenses, the recognition of realized gains and losses, and changes in unrealized appreciation and depreciation on the investment portfolio. 
 Investment Income 
 We expect our portfolio to continue to grow as we raise and deploy capital through our private offering and our investment income to grow commensurately. The shifting environment in base interest rates may affect our investment income over the long term. Increases in interest rates, however, may adversely affect our existing borrowers. 
 Investment income increased to 24.4 million and 72.8 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, from 21.2 million and 60.7 million for the comparable period in the prior year, primarily due to increased investment activity driven by an increase in our deployed capital and an increase in interest income from our portfolio investments and, to a lesser extent, fee income.

 Interest Expenses and Credit Facility Fees 
 76 

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

 Interest expenses and credit facility fees increased to 7.9 million and 22.1 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 5.8 million and 17.9 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to increased expenses related to the issuance of the Notes (as defined below) on December 21, 2023 as well as the increased usage of our Credit Facilities. Expenses during the period ended June 30, 2023 included an acceleration of debt financing costs in the amount of 1.4 million related to the Amendment (as defined below) of the JPM Facility (as defined below), see "JPM Facility" below for more information. 
 Net Realized Gains/Losses 
 We measure realized gains or losses by the difference between the net proceeds from the disposition and the amortized cost basis of an investment, without regard to unrealized gains or losses previously recognized. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we had a realized loss of (0.8) million due to the extinguishment of the CIBC Facility. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we had a net realized loss of (0.8) million which was due to the loss on the extinguishment of the CIBC Facility, a loss realized from the winddown of two interest rate swaps during the period, slightly offset by an escrow payment from a previously realized investment. 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we had (0.4) million and (0.4) million, respectively, of realized losses, due to the disposition of one of our portfolio companies. 
 Net Change in Unrealized Appreciation/Depreciation 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we had 1.4 million and 0.6 million, respectively, of unrealized appreciation on portfolio investments. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2023, we had 2.5 million of unrealized appreciation on investments due to the decrease in cost of the Subordinated Certificates as well as overall favorable market spread adjustments on the portfolio during the period. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we had (3.7) million of unrealized depreciation on investments due to overall unfavorable market spread adjustments on the portfolio during the period. 
 Net Increase in Net Assets Resulting from Operations 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the net increase in net assets resulting from operations was 12.9 million or 0.31 per share and 37.7 million or 0.91 per share, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the net increase in net assets resulting from operations was 13.4 million or 0.32 per share and 27.5 million and 0.66 per share, respectively. 
 Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 We expect to generate cash primarily from (i) the net proceeds from drawdowns of our capital commitments to purchase shares of our common stock pursuant to our private offering of our shares (the "Offering"), (ii) cash flows from our operations, (iii) proceeds from net borrowings on the JPM Facility and the SMBC Facility and (iv) any future offerings of our equity or debt securities. We may fund a portion of our investments through borrowings under the JPM Facility and the SMBC Facility and issuances of senior securities. Our primary use of cash will be for (i) investments in portfolio companies in accordance with our investment objective and investment strategies and to comply with certain portfolio diversification requirements, (ii) providing capital to the SDLP through the Subordinated Certificates, (iii) the cost of operations (including paying the Adviser), (iv) debt service and other financing costs of any borrowings, (v) any cash distributions to the holders of our common stock, and (vi) general working capital purposes. We will also pay operating expenses, including advisory and administrative fees and expenses, and may pay other expenses such as due diligence expenses of potential new investments, from the net proceeds of the Offering. 
 Equity 
 We are authorized to issue 500,000,000 shares of common stock at 0.01 par value per share. 
 On March 29, 2022, in connection with its seed audit, we issued 100 shares of common stock for 10.00 to Varagon, which were subsequently redeemed on June 2, 2022 in connection with the Merger. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had received capital commitments totaling 488.2 million 73.5 million remaining undrawn), of which 7.2 million 1.2 remaining undrawn) is from Varagon and current officers and directors of the Company. On June 2, 2022, we held our Initial Closing and entered into Subscription Agreements with a number of investors providing for the private placement of our shares of common stock. 
 The following table summarizes the total shares issued and proceeds received related to capital drawdowns delivered pursuant to the Subscription Agreements from inception through September 30, 2024 (dollars in thousands, except per share data):

Distributions and Dividend Reinvestments 
 Distributions to common shareholders are recorded on the ex-dividend date. We have elected, and intend to qualify annually, to be treated as a RIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes under the Code. The Company will be required to distribute dividends each tax year as a RIC to its shareholders of an amount generally at least equal to 90 of its investment company taxable income, determined without regard to any deduction for dividends paid, in order to be eligible for tax benefits allowed to a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. The Company anticipates paying out as a distribution all or substantially all of those amounts. The amount to be paid out as a dividend is determined by the Board and is based on management s estimate of the Company s annual taxable income. Net realized capital gains, if any, are generally distributed, although the Company may decide to retain such net realized capital gains for investment. 
 With respect to distributions, we have adopted an opt out distribution reinvestment plan DRIP for common shareholders. As a result, in the event of a declared distribution, each shareholder that has not opted out of the DRIP will have their dividends or distributions automatically reinvested in additional shares of our common stock rather than receiving cash distributions. Shareholders who receive distributions in the form of shares of common stock will be subject to the same U.S. federal, state and local tax consequences as if they received cash distributions. 
 The following table reflects the distributions per share that the Company has declared, including shares issued under the DRIP, on its common stock from inception through September 30, 2024 (dollars in thousands):

Income Taxes 
 The Company has elected, and intends to qualify annually, to be treated as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. As a RIC, the Company generally will not pay U.S. federal income taxes at corporate rates on any ordinary income or capital gains that it timely distributes to its shareholders as dividends. To qualify as a RIC, the Company must meet certain minimum distribution, source-of-income, and asset diversification requirements. The minimum distribution requirements applicable to the RIC require the Company to distribute at least 90 of its investment company taxable income, as defined by the Code, each year. 
 The Company is subject to a nondeductible 4 U.S. federal excise tax on its undistributed income, unless it timely distributes (or is deemed to have timely distributed) an amount equal to the sum of (1) 98 of ordinary income for each calendar year, (2) 98.2 of the amount by which capital gains exceeds capital losses (adjusted for certain ordinary losses) for a one-year period ending on October 31 of the calendar year, and (3) any income and gains recognized, but not distributed, from the previous years. While the Company intends to distribute any income and capital gains to avoid imposition of this 4 U.S. federal excise tax, it may not be successful in avoiding entirely the imposition of this tax. In that case, the Company will be liable for the tax only on the amount by which it does not meet the foregoing distribution requirement. 
 78 

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

 The Company evaluates tax positions taken in the course of preparing the Company s tax returns to determine whether the tax positions are more-likely-than-not to be sustained by the applicable tax authority in accordance with ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes ASC 740 ). Tax benefits of positions not deemed to meet the more-likely-than-not threshold, or uncertain tax positions, would be recorded as tax expense in the current year. All penalties and interest associated with income taxes are included in income tax expense. It is the Company s policy to recognize accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax benefits in income tax expense. Conclusions regarding tax positions are subject to review and may be adjusted at a later date based on factors including, but not limited to, on-going analyses of tax laws, regulations and interpretations thereof. As of September 30, 2024, the Company did not have any uncertain tax positions that met the recognition or measurement criteria, nor did the Company have any unrecognized tax benefits. 
 Our accounting policy on income taxes is critical because if we are unable to maintain our tax treatment as a RIC, we would be required to record a provision for U.S. federal income taxes, which may be significant to our financial results. 
 Federal Income Taxes 
 The Company is subject to the U.S. federal income tax rules and filing requirements. The Company is expected to have minimal or no income subject to tax and therefore no provision has been included for taxes due. The Company has elected to be treated, and intends to qualify annually, as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. As a result, the Company generally does not expect to be subject to U.S. federal income taxes. 
 The Company has not recorded a liability for any uncertain tax positions pursuant to the provisions of ASC 740 as of September 30, 2024. 
 In the normal course of business, the Company is subject to examination by federal and certain state and local tax regulators. The Company adopted a tax year-end of December 31. 
 For income tax purposes, distributions paid to shareholders are reported as ordinary income, return of capital, long-term capital gains, or a combination thereof. 
 Credit Facilities 
 JPM Facility 
 On June 2, 2022, the Company's wholly owned subsidiary, VCCF, entered into the Loan and Security Agreement (the Loan and Security Agreement and the revolving credit facility thereunder, the JPM Facility with JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association, as administrative agent JPMorgan ). 
 The JPM Facility currently allows VCCF to borrow up to 300 million, subject to certain leverage and borrowing base restrictions, and may potentially be expanded up to 600 million with the consent of the lenders. The JPM Facility s reinvestment period ends on June 2, 2025 and has a termination date of June 2, 2027. 
 The JPM Facility bears interest at an annual rate of: (i) with respect to interest based reference rate other than a term SOFR, the reference rate plus a margin equal to 2.375 per annum; provided that, in the case of advances denominated in British Pounds, the margin shall be 2.494 per annum (ii) with respect to interest based on a term SOFR, the SOFR plus a margin equal to 2.475 per annum and (iii) with respect to interest based on a Base Rate, the Base Rate plus a margin equal to 2.475 per annum. JPMorgan determines the reference rate. The Company paid a fee of 0.50 per annum on the average daily committed but unused amounts under the JPM Facility during its ramp-up period (June 2, 2022 up to but not including March 2, 2023), and, beginning March 3, 2023, pays a fee of 0.75 on annum. 
 On January 26, 2023, the Company entered into the First Amendment to the Loan and Security Agreement (the First Amendment ). The First Amendment, among other things: (i) reduces the borrowings available under the JPM Facility from up to 500 million to up to 300 million, subject to certain leverage and borrowing base restrictions; and (ii) reduces the commitment increase, subject to lender consent, from up to 800 million to up to 600 million. The reduction was accounted for as a debt modification to a line-of-credit or revolving-debt arrangement in accordance with ASC 470-50, Modifications and Extinguishments, which attributed to an acceleration of debt financing costs in the amount of 1.4 million and was recorded on the consolidated statements of operations as a component of "Credit facility fees." 
 On November 20, 2023, the Company entered into the Second Amendment to the Loan and Security Agreement (the "Second Amendment"). The Second Amendment, among other things: (i) permits the inclusion of revolving loans as collateral to the JPM Facility; (ii) decreases the minimum funding amount under the Loan and Agreement from 85 to 75 of the financing commitment which commenced November 21, 2023; and (iii) increases the percentage of Collateral Principal Amount (as defined in the Second Amendment) that may consist of portfolio investments the obligors of which have a leverage ratio equal to or greater than 7.0x from 0.0 to 10.0 . 
 The following table summarizes the interest expense, non-usage fees and amortization of financing costs incurred on the JPM Facility for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (dollars in thousands):

CIBC Facility 
 On January 31, 2023, the Company entered into a Senior Secured Revolving Credit Agreement (the CIBC Credit Agreement and the senior secured credit facility thereunder, the CIBC Facility among the Company, as borrower, the lenders party thereto from time to time, the issuing banks party thereto from time to time, and CIBC Bank USA ("CIBC"), as administrative agent and as sole lead arranger. The CIBC Facility was guaranteed by VCCEH, and could have been guaranteed by certain domestic subsidiaries of the Company that would have been formed or acquired by the Company in the future (collectively, the Guarantors ). Proceeds of the CIBC Facility were used for general corporate purposes, including the funding of portfolio investments. The initial maximum principal amount of the CIBC Facility was 75 million, subject to availability under the borrowing base, which was based on the Company s and Guarantor s portfolio investments and other outstanding indebtedness. The CIBC Facility was secured by a perfected first-priority interest in substantially all of the portfolio investments held by the Company and each Guarantor, subject to certain exceptions. The CIBC Facility's commitment termination date was January 31, 2026 and had a final maturity date of January 31, 2028. 
 The CIBC Facility bore interest from January 1, 2023 to January 31, 2026 (the "Availability Period") at an annual rate of: (i) with respect to interest based on the greatest of (a) the Prime Rate, (b) the Federal Funds Effective Rate plus 1/2 of 1 and (c) zero (the "ABR"), the ABR plus a margin equal to 1.500 per annum; and (ii) with respect to interest based on a term SOFR, the SOFR plus a margin equal to 2.500 per annum and after the Availability Period at an annual rate of: (i) with respect to interest based on the ABR, the ABR plus a margin equal to 1.750 per annum; and (ii) with respect to interest based on a term SOFR, the SOFR plus a margin equal to 2.750 per annum. CIBC, as the administrative agent determines the reference rate. The Company paid a fee of 0.375 per annum on the average daily committed but unused amounts under the CIBC Facility during the first nine months of the CIBC Facility (January 31, 2023 up to but not including October 31, 2023), and thereafter, 0.375 if the average daily used amount of the commitment exceeds 25 of the total commitment or otherwise, 0.50 . 
 
 On August 9, 2024, the Company terminated in full (i) the CIBC Credit Agreement and the CIBC Facility, and (ii) the security interest over the collateral granted to CIBC as the lender pursuant to the CIBC Credit Agreement and the other Loan Documents (as defined in the CIBC Credit Agreement), each pertaining to the CIBC Facility. The CIBC Facility terminated upon the satisfaction of all obligations and liabilities of the Company to CIBC as the lender thereunder, including, without limitation, payments of principal and interest, other fees, breakage costs and other amounts owing to CIBC. The termination was accounted for as a debt extinguishment in accordance with ASC 470-50, Modifications and Extinguishments , which resulted in a realized loss of 0.8 million and was recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Operations as a loss on extinguishment of debt. 
 The following table summarizes the interest expense, non-usage fees and amortization of financing costs incurred on the CIBC Facility for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (dollars in thousands):

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

 (1) On August 9, 2024, the Company repaid all amounts outstanding under the CIBC Facility, including outstanding borrowings and accrued interest, and terminated the CIBC Facility. 
 
 SMBC Facility 
 On August 9, 2024, the Company entered into a Senior Secured Revolving Credit Agreement (the SMBC Credit Agreement and the senior secured credit facility thereunder, the SMBC Facility among the Company, as borrower, the lenders party thereto from time to time, the issuing banks party thereto from time to time, and Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation, as administrative agent, sole book runner and lead arranger. 
 The SMBC Facility is guaranteed by VCCEH, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, and will be guaranteed by certain Guarantors. Proceeds of the SMBC Facility may be used for general corporate purposes, including the funding of portfolio investments. 
 The initial maximum principal amount of the SMBC Facility was 170,000,000, subject to availability under the borrowing base, which is based on the Company s and Guarantors portfolio investments and other outstanding indebtedness. Maximum capacity under the SMBC Facility may be increased to 400,000,000 through the exercise by the Company of an uncommitted accordion feature through which existing and new lenders may, at their option, agree to provide additional financing. The SMBC Facility is secured by a perfected first-priority interest in substantially all of the portfolio investments held by the Company and each Guarantor, subject to certain exceptions. 
 The availability period under the SMBC Facility will terminate on August 9, 2028 (the SMBC Commitment Termination Date and the SMBC Facility will mature on August 9, 2029 (the SMBC Maturity Date ). During the period from the SMBC Commitment Termination Date to the SMBC Maturity Date, the Company will be obligated to make mandatory prepayments under the SMBC Credit Agreement out of the proceeds of certain asset sales and other recovery events, equity and debt issuances and other returns of capital and extraordinary receipts. 
 The Company may borrow amounts in U.S. dollars or certain other permitted currencies. Amounts drawn under the SMBC Facility will bear interest at either term SOFR plus a 1.000 or 1.125 margin, or the alternate base rate plus a 2.000 or 2.125 margin depending on the SMBC Facilities ratio of the borrowing base compared to the outstanding debt of the SMBC Facility. The Company may elect either the term SOFR or the alternate base rate at the time of drawdown, and loans may be converted from one rate to another at any time at the Company s option, subject to certain conditions. The Company will also pay a fee of 0.375 on average daily undrawn amounts under the SMBC Facility. 
 The SMBC Credit Agreement includes customary covenants, including certain limitations on the incurrence by the Company of additional indebtedness and on the Company s ability to make distributions to its shareholders, or redeem, repurchase or retire shares of stock, upon the occurrence of certain events and certain financial covenants related to asset coverage and liquidity and other maintenance covenants, as well as customary events of default. 
 On August 28, 2024, the Company closed an additional 25.0 million of commitments under the SMBC Facility increasing the maximum principal amount to 195,000,000. 
 At September 30, 2024, the carrying amount of the Company's borrowings under the SMBC Facility approximated their fair value. The fair values of the Company's debt obligations are determined in accordance with ASC 820, which defines fair value in terms of the price that would be paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date under current market conditions. The fair value of our borrowings under the SMBC Facility would be deemed to be Level 3 investments.

Unsecured Notes 
 
 On December 21, 2023, the Company entered into a Master Note Purchase Agreement (the Note Purchase Agreement governing the issuance of 25,000,000 in aggregate principal amount of Series A Senior Notes, Tranche A, due December 21, 2026, with a fixed interest rate of 8.10 per year (the 2026 Notes ), and 25,000,000 in aggregate principal amount of Series A Senior Notes, Tranche B, due December 21, 2028, with a fixed interest rate of 8.20 per year (the 2028 Notes and, together with the 2026 Notes, the Notes ), to qualified institutional investors in a private offering exempt from the registration requirements of the 1933 Act. The Notes are guaranteed by VCC Equity Holdings, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. 
 
 Interest on the Notes will be payable semi-annually on June 21 and December 21 each year. The 2026 Notes and the 2028 Notes may be redeemed in whole or in part at any time or from time to time at the Company s option prior to September 21, 2026 and September 21, 2028, respectively, at par plus accrued interest to the redemption date and a make-whole premium, and thereafter at par plus accrued interest to the redemption date. In addition, the Company is obligated to offer to prepay the Notes at par plus accrued and unpaid interest up to, but excluding, the date of prepayment, if certain change in control events occur. The Notes are general unsecured obligations of the Company that rank pari passu with all outstanding and future unsecured unsubordinated indebtedness issued by the Company. 
 
 On February 2, 2024, in connection with each of the 2026 Notes and the 2028 Notes, the Company entered into an interest rate swap 
 agreement for a total notional amount of 25,000,000 and 25,000,000 that matures on December 21, 2026 and December 21, 2028, 
 respectively. Under the interest rate swap agreement for the 2026 Notes and the 2028 Notes, the Company receives a fixed interest rate of 8.10 and 8.20 and pays a floating interest rate of SOFR + 4.226 and SOFR + 4.595 , respectively. The Company designated these interest rate swaps, the 2026 Notes, and the 2028 Notes as a qualifying fair value hedge accounting relationship. For more information, see Item 1. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Note 5. Derivative Instruments in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 
 At September 30, 2024, the carrying amount of the Notes approximated their fair value.

 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 Portfolio Company Commitments 
 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had commitments under loan and financing agreements to fund up to 58.0 million to 37 portfolio companies and 22.7 million to 29 portfolio companies, respectively. These commitments are primarily composed of senior secured term loans and revolvers, and an analysis of their fair value is included in the Consolidated Schedule of Investments. The commitments are generally subject to the borrowers meeting certain criteria such as compliance with covenants and certain operational metrics. The terms of the borrowings and financings subject to commitment are comparable to the terms of other loan and equity securities in our portfolio.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated statements of assets and liabilities. Changes in the economic environment, financial markets, and any other parameters used in determining such estimates could cause actual results to differ. Critical accounting policies are those that require the application of management s most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often because of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and that may change in subsequent periods. 
 Valuation of Portfolio Securities. 
 Investments are valued at the end of each calendar quarter. Most of our investments may be in loans that do not have readily available market quotations. Assets that are not publicly traded or whose market prices are not readily available are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by the Board. In connection with that determination, portfolio company valuations will be prepared using sources, preliminary valuations obtained from independent valuation firms depending on the availability of information on our assets and the type of asset being valued, all in accordance with our valuation policy. The participation of the Adviser in the valuation process could result in a conflict of interest because the Adviser s management fee is based in part on our gross assets. 
 Because fair values, and particularly fair values of private securities and private companies, are inherently uncertain, they may fluctuate over short periods of time, and are often based to a large extent on estimates, comparisons and qualitative evaluations of private information, our determinations of fair value may differ materially from the values that would have been determined if a ready market for these securities existed. This could make it more difficult for our shareholders to value accurately our portfolio investments and could lead to undervaluation or overvaluation of our interests. In addition, the valuation of these types of securities may result in substantial write-downs and earnings volatility. 
 NAV as of a particular date may be materially greater than or less than the value that would be realized if assets were to be liquidated as of such date. For example, if we were required to sell a certain asset or all or a substantial portion of our assets on a particular date, the actual price that we would realize upon the disposition of such asset or assets could be materially less than the value of such asset or assets as reflected in our NAV. Volatile market conditions could also cause reduced liquidity in the market for certain assets, which could result in liquidation values that are materially less than the values of such assets as reflected in NAV. 
 For more information regarding the fair value hierarchies, our framework for determining fair value and the composition of our portfolio, see "Item 1. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Note 2. Significant Accounting Policies in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

 Revenue Recognition 
 Investment transactions are accounted for on a trade-date basis. Realized gains or losses on investments are measured by the difference between the net proceeds from the disposition and the amortized cost basis of investment, without regard to unrealized gains or losses previously recognized. The Company reports current period changes in fair value of investments that are measured at fair value as a component of the net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investments in the consolidated statements of operations. 
 Investment Income 
 Interest income, including amortization of premium and accretion of discount, is recorded on the accrual basis to the extent that such amounts are expected to be collected. The Company records amortized or accreted discounts or premiums as interest income using the effective interest method and is adjusted only for material amendments or prepayments. Dividend income, which represents dividends from equity investments and distributions from subsidiaries, if any, is recognized on an accrual basis to the extent that the Company expects to collect such amount. 
 Interest income from investments in the Subordinated Certificates of SDLP is recorded based on an estimate of an effective yield to expected maturity utilizing assumed cash flows in accordance with ASC Topic 325-40, Beneficial Interests in Securitized Financial Assets . The Company monitors the expected cash flows from these investments, including the expected residual payments, and the effective yield is determined and updated periodically. Any difference between the cash distribution received and the amount calculated pursuant to the effective interest method is recorded as an adjustment to the cost basis of such investments. 
 PIK Interest 
 The Company may, from time to time, hold loans in its portfolio that contain a payment-in-kind ("PIK") interest provision. PIK interest, computed at the contractual rate specified in each loan agreement, is periodically added to the principal balance of the loan, rather than being paid to the Company in cash, and is recorded as interest income. Thus, the actual collection of PIK interest may be deferred until the time of debt principal repayment. 
 PIK interest, which is a non-cash source of income at the time of recognition, is included in the Company s taxable income, and therefore affects the amount the Company would be required to distribute to its shareholders to maintain its tax treatment as a RIC for federal income tax purposes, even though the Company had not yet collected the cash. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company earned PIK interest of 0.7 million and 1.2 million, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company earned PIK interest of 0.1 million and 0.3 million, respectively, reflected on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations as part of interest income. 
 Fee Income 
 Origination fees received are recorded as deferred income and recognized as investment income over the term of the loan. Upon prepayment of a loan, any unamortized origination fees are recorded as investment income. The Company receives certain fees from portfolio companies, which are non-recurring in nature. Such fees include loan prepayment penalties, structuring fees, covenant waiver fees and loan amendment fees, and are recorded as investment income when earned. Some of the fees earned by the Company may be PIK fee income. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company did not earn any PIK fee income, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company earned 7,524 and 7,524 of PIK fee income, respectively. 
 Non-accrual loans 
 A loan can be left on accrual status during the period the Company is pursuing repayment of the loan. Management reviews all loans that become 90 days or more past due on principal and interest, or when there is reasonable doubt that principal or interest will be collected, for possible placement on non-accrual status. When a loan is placed on non-accrual status, unpaid interest credited to income is reversed. Additionally, any original issue discount and market discount are no longer accreted to interest income as of the date the loan is placed on non-accrual status. Interest payments received on non-accrual loans are recognized as income or applied to principal depending upon management s judgment. Non-accrual loans are restored to accrual status when past due principal and interest is paid, and, in management s judgment, payments are likely to remain current. There were no loans on non-accrual as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

 Recent Developments 
 Dividend Declaration 
 On November 6, 2024, the Board declared a dividend of 0.2392 per share and a special dividend of 0.0675 per share, both payable on January 17, 2025 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on December 31, 2024. 
 Pricing of CLO Transaction 
 On October 31, 2024, we, through VCC CLO, priced a 493.77 million term debt securitization (the CLO Transaction ). The CLO Transaction is expected to close on or about November 26, 2024 (the Closing ). The VCC CLO Secured Debt (as defined below) to be issued by VCC CLO in the CLO Transaction will be secured by a portfolio of collateral obligations consisting primarily of middle market loans and participation interests therein. 
 The CLO Transaction is expected to be executed through a private placement of several securities (collectively, VCC CLO Secured Debt ), which include the Class A-1 Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes, Class A-2 Senior Secured Floating Rate Loans, Class B Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes, Class B Senior Secured Floating Rate Loans, and Class C Mezzanine Secured Deferrable Floating Rate Notes. Additionally, it includes a purchase by VCC CLO Depositor of the subordinated notes issued by VCC CLO (the Subordinated Notes and, together with the VCC CLO Secured Debt, the VCC CLO Debt ). 
 We, through VCC CLO Depositor, are expected to acquire 100 of the Subordinated Notes at the Closing and will be required to retain the Subordinated Notes in accordance with the U.S. Risk Retention Rules at and after the Closing. The Subordinated Notes will not bear interest. 
 We expect that the VCC CLO Debt will mature on October 20, 2036, unless otherwise redeemed earlier in accordance with the terms of the indenture governing the VCC CLO Debt, to be executed at the Closing (the Indenture ).

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 We are subject to financial market risks, including the valuation of our investment portfolio and changes in interest rates. The prices of securities held by us may decline in response to certain events, including those directly involving the companies in which we invest; conditions affecting the general economy, including inflationary pressures; overall market changes, including an increase in market volatility and interest rate volatility; legislative reform; and general political, social or economic instability. Generally, a rise in the general level of interest rates, like the current elevated interest rate environment, can be expected to lead to higher interest rates applicable to any variable rate investments we may hold and lead to declines in the value of any fixed rate investments we may hold. However, for variable rate investments that have an interest rate floor, our interest income will not decrease below a threshold amount. To the extent that a substantial portion of our investments may be in variable rate investments, an increase in interest rates beyond this threshold would make it easier for us to meet or exceed the hurdle rate applicable to the upper level breakpoint of the pre-incentive fee net investment income incentive fee, and may result in a substantial increase in our net investment income and to the amount of incentive fees payable to the Adviser with respect to our increased pre-incentive fee net investment income. Conversely, a decline in the general level of interest rates can be expected to lead to lower interest rates applicable to any variable rate investments we may hold and to increases in the value of any fixed rate investments we may hold. Such a decrease would make it more difficult for us to meet or exceed the hurdle rate applicable to the upper level breakpoint of the pre-incentive fee net investment income incentive fee, and may result in a substantial decrease in our net investment income and to the amount of incentive fees payable to the Adviser with respect to our decreased pre-incentive fee net investment income. 
 In addition, we borrow funds in order to make additional investments. Our net investment income will depend, in part, upon the difference between the rate at which we borrow funds and the rate at which we invest those funds. As a result, we will be subject to risks relating to changes in market interest rates. In periods of elevated interest rates, when we or any future subsidiaries have debt outstanding or financing arrangements in effect, our interest expense will increase, which could reduce our net investment income, particularly to the extent we hold fixed rate investments. 
 We expect that our long-term investments will be financed primarily with equity and debt. In connection with each of the 2026 Notes and the 2028 Notes, we entered into an interest rate swap agreement in an effort to minimize our exposure to interest rate fluctuations. These techniques may include various interest rate hedging activities to the extent permitted by the 1940 Act. Adverse developments resulting from changes in interest rates or hedging transactions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 We invest primarily in illiquid debt of private companies. Most of our investments will not have a readily available market quotation, and we value these investments at fair value as determined in good faith by our Board, based on, among other things, the input of the Adviser, our Audit Committee and independent third-party valuation firm(s) engaged at the direction of the Board, and in accordance with our valuation policy. There is no single technique for determining fair value. As a result, determining fair value requires that judgment be applied to the specific facts and circumstances of each portfolio investment while employing a consistently applied valuation process for the types of investments we make. If, in the future, we are required to liquidate a portfolio investment in a forced or liquidation sale, we may realize amounts that are different from the amounts presented and such differences could be material. 
 Valuation Risk 
 We plan to invest primarily in senior secured loans but may also selectively invest in second lien and subordinated or mezzanine loans of, and equity and equity-related securities in, U.S. middle market companies. Most of our investments will not have a readily available market quotation, and we will value these investments at fair value as determined in good faith by the Board in accordance with our valuation policy. There is no single standard for determining fair value in good faith. As a result, determining fair value requires that judgment be applied to the specific facts and circumstances of each portfolio investment while employing a consistently applied valuation process for the types of investments we make. If we were required to liquidate a portfolio investment in a forced or liquidation sale, we may realize amounts that are different from the amounts presented and such differences could be material.

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

 Interest Rate Risk 
 We are subject to interest rate risk. Interest rate risk is defined as the sensitivity of our current and future earnings to interest rate volatility, variability of spread relationships, the difference in re-pricing internals between our assets and liabilities and the effect that interest rates may have on our cash flows. Because we intend to fund a portion of our investments with borrowings, our net investment income is affected by the difference between the rate at which we invest and the rate at which we borrow. As a result, there can be no assurance that a significant change in market interest rates will not have a material adverse effect on our net investment income. 
 Since March 2022, the Federal Reserve raised interest rates bringing rates to the 5.25 to 5.50 range. Although the Federal Reserve left its benchmark rates steady in the second quarter of 2024, it subsequently cut the federal funds rate by 50 basis points in September 2024 and an additional 25 basis points in November 2024 following improved inflation data. While the Federal Reserve indicated that there may be additional rate cuts in 2024, future reductions to benchmark rates are not certain. In an elevated interest rate environment, our cost of funds would increase, which could reduce our net investment income if there is not a corresponding increase in interest income generated by our investment portfolio. It is possible that the Federal Reserve's tightening cycle could force the United States into a recession. A prolonged reduction in interest rates will reduce our gross investment income and could result in a decrease in our net investment income if such decreases in base rates, such as SOFR, are not offset by corresponding increases in the spread over such base rate that we earn on any portfolio investments, a decrease in our operating expenses, or a decrease in the interest rate associated with our borrowings. Furthermore, in a lower interest rate environment, we could face a situation where our outstanding debt obligations carry higher coupon payments than newly issued debt, resulting in an increase in relative borrowing costs unless we are able to refinance at more favorable terms. 
 As of September 30, 2024, all income producing investments in our portfolio and the outstanding borrowings under our credit facilities were at floating rates indexed to SOFR. In addition, the Notes bear interest at fixed rates but have swapped from a fixed rate to a floating rate through interest rate swaps. 
 The following table shows the estimated annualized impact on net investment income based on hypothetical base rate changes in interest rates on our loan portfolio and outstanding debt as of September 30, 2024, assuming there are no changes in our investment and borrowing structure (dollars in thousands).

 Although we believe that this analysis is indicative of our existing sensitivity to interest rate changes, it does not adjust for changes in the credit market, credit quality, the size and composition of the assets in our portfolio and other business developments that could affect our net income. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that actual results would not differ materially from the analysis above.

 In accordance with Rules 13a-15(b) and 15d-15(b) of the Exchange Act, we, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based on the foregoing, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were (a) designed to ensure that the information we are required to disclose in our reports under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, and reported in an accurate manner and on a timely basis and the information that we are required to disclose in our Exchange Act reports is accumulated and communicated to management to permit timely decisions with respect to required disclosure and (b) operating in an effective manner. 
 Change in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 No change occurred in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
