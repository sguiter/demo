The T M segment consists of our line of aerospace products, including flight deck printers, networking hardware, and related accessories as well as T M data acquisition systems sold under the AstroNova brand name. On May 4, 2024, we entered into an agreement to acquire MTEX New Solution, S.A., MTEX ), a Portugal-based manufacturer of digital printing equipment that addresses a wide variety of markets and applications including textiles, packaging, labeling, apparel, footwear and more. We reported MTEX as a part of our PI segment as of May 6, 2024, the closing date of this acquisition. Refer to Note 3, Acquisition for further details.

Unless otherwise indicated, references to AstroNova, the Company, we, our, and us in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q refer to AstroNova, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries. Basis of Presentation The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and reflect all adjustments consisting of normal recurring adjustments which, in the opinion of management, are necessary for a fair presentation of the results of the interim periods included herein. These financial statements do not include all disclosures associated with annual financial statements and, accordingly, should be read in conjunction with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2024. The presentation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported and disclosed in the condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes, including those that require consideration of forecasted financial information using information that is reasonably available to us at this time. Some of the more significant estimates relate to revenue recognition, allowances for doubtful accounts, inventory valuation, income taxes, valuation of long-lived assets, intangible assets and goodwill, share-based compensation, contingent consideration liability and warranty reserves. Management s estimates are based on the facts and circumstances available at the time estimates are made, historical experience, risk of loss, general economic conditions and trends, and management s assessments of the probable future outcome of these matters. Consequently, actual results could differ from those estimates. Results of operations for the interim periods presented herein are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the full year.

, AstroNova, along with its wholly-owned Portugal Subsidiary, AstroNova Portugal, Unipessoal, Lda (the Purchaser entered into a Share Purchase Agreement (the Purchase Agreement with Effort Premier Solutions Lda., a private limited company incorporated under the laws of Portugal (the Seller and El i Serafim Alves Ferreira, as the Second Guarantor . In accordance with the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Purchase Agreement, the Purchaser acquired from the Seller, of the issued and outstanding share capital of MTEX. The closing date for the acquisition was . This transaction is a business combination and accounted for using the acquisition method as prescribed by ASC 805. The purchase price for this acquisition consists of EUR (approximately million) paid by the Purchaser to the Seller on the closing date, and up to an additional EUR (approximately million) retained by the Purchaser to secure certain indemnification obligations of the Seller to be released by the Purchaser subject to resolution of such obligations. The Seller may be entitled to additional contingent consideration if specified revenue targets are achieved by MTEX as set forth in the Purchase Agreement for the three calendar year periods ending after the closing date. The contingent consideration consists of potential earn-out payments to the seller of EUR million (approximately million) if the specified revenue target is achieved in the full fiscal year of 2025, an additional EUR million (approximately million) if the specified revenue target is achieved in full fiscal year 2026, and an additional EUR million (approximately million) if the specified earnings targets are achieved in full fiscal year 2027, with a maximum of EUR million (approximately million) if all of the specified earnings targets are achieved over the three-year period . Also on May 4, 2024, the Purchaser, the Seller, the Second Guarantor and MTEX entered into a Transitional Management Agreement (the Transitional Management Agreement pursuant to which the Second Guarantor will serve as MTEX s Chief Executive Officer for a term of three years following the closing date. Under the terms of the Transitional Management Agreement, the Second Guarantor will receive a salary and grant of restricted stock units and will be entitled to participate in our incentive compensation programs on the same terms as our executive officers. The Transitional Management Agreement includes customary non-competition and confidentiality provisions. Upon the closing of the transaction, MTEX became a wholly owned indirect subsidiary of AstroNova, Inc.

a) The holdback amount is expected to be paid out in full over the next two years. 

The approach to valuing the initial contingent consideration relating to the earn-out requires the use of unobservable factors such as projected revenues over the term of the earn-out periods, discounted for the period over which the initial contingent consideration is measured, and relevant volatility rates. Based upon these assumptions, the earn-out contingent consideration was valued using an option pricing model, which resulted in the estimated fair value being reduced to as of the acquisition closing date.

Although we have made a few adjustments to the opening balance sheet in the third quarter of the current year as we continue to finalize our due diligence and accounting for this acquisition, the amounts above remain provisional and are based on information that is currently available. Management believes the information provides a reasonable basis for estimating the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed but is waiting to complete their financial due diligence necessary to finalize those fair values. Therefore, the provisional measurements of fair value reflected continue to be subject to changes that could be significant. Management anticipates there will be changes to the price allocation as further information is collected and analyzed and pending the final completion of certain appraisals and valuation report. We expect to complete the final fair value determination of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, resolutions of working capital, and any other purchase price adjustments identified as soon as practicable within the measurement period and, in any event, not later than one year from the acquisition closing date.

The customer relations intangible asset represents the relationships that will be maintained with certain historical customers of MTEX. The trademark/tradename intangible assets reflect the industry reputation of the MTEX name and the registered trademarks held by MTEX for the use of several marks and logos. The internally developed technology intangible asset represents software used to collect a wide range of data on each piece of equipment and the ability to monitor customer ink usage and troubleshoot issues with customers.

used to calculate the present value of the stream of anticipated cash flows. The fair value of the trademark intangible asset acquired was estimated by applying the income approach using the relief-from-royalty method. The value under the relief-from-royalty method is a function of (i) the concluded royalty rate of , (ii) projected revenues generated by product sales under the asset being valued, and (iii) a discount rate of . The fair value of the internally developed technology intangible asset acquired was estimated by applying the cost approach, which takes into consideration the internal development costs of the technology and a hypothetical developer s profit margin to build the software, the opportunity costs the buyer avoids by not having to reproduce this asset and any duplicative or unproductive efforts, as well as functional obsolescence of the technology. Goodwill of million, which is not deductible for tax purposes, represents the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value assigned to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed from MTEX. The goodwill recognized under ASC 805 is attributable to the expected earnings potential of the business, synergies which are expected to enhance and expand our overall product portfolio, opportunities in new and existing markets, and MTEX's assembled workforce. The carrying amount of the goodwill was allocated to the PI segment. During the third quarter of the current year, we incurred an additional million of acquisition-related costs resulting in total acquisition-related costs of million as of November 2, 2024. These costs were included in general and administrative expenses in our condensed consolidated statements of income for the three and nine months ended November 2, 2024.

Total Revenue 

In December 2022, we entered into an amended contract with one of our T M customers that provided for a total payment of million to us as a result of our claims allowable under French law relating to additional component costs we have incurred and will continue to incur in order to supply aerospace printers under the contract for the period beginning in April 2022 and continuing through fiscal 2025. Revenue from this arrangement will be recognized in proportion to the total estimated shipments through the end of the contract period. As of January 31, 2024, we recognized million in revenue and the million balance was recorded as deferred revenue. During the nine months ended November 2, 2024, we recognized an additional million which is included in revenue in the condensed consolidated statement of income for the respective period presented, and there is balance in deferred revenue at November 2, 2024. Contract Assets and Liabilities We normally do not have contract assets, which are primarily unbilled accounts receivable that are conditional on something other than the passage of time. Our contract liabilities, which represent billings in excess of revenue recognized, are related to advanced billings for purchased service agreements and extended warranties. Contract liabilities were and at November 2, 2024 and January 31, 2024, respectively, and are recorded as deferred revenue in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet. The decrease in the deferred revenue balance during the nine months ended November 2, 2024 is due to revenue recognized during the current period, including of revenue recognized that was included in the deferred revenue balance at January 31, 2024, partially offset by cash payments received in advance of satisfying performance obligations.

years as of November 2, 2024. The balance of these contract assets at January 31, 2024 was million. We also recognize an asset for the costs to fulfill a contract with a customer if the costs are specifically identifiable, generate or enhance resources used to satisfy future performance obligations, and are expected to be recovered. In fiscal 2025, we incurred million of costs to fulfill a contract which will be amortized over approximately years. During the three and nine months ended November 2, 2024, we amortized contract costs of and , respectively. The balance of deferred incremental direct costs net of accumulated amortization at November 2, 2024 was million, of which million is reported in other current assets, and million is reported in other assets in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet.

Product Retrofit Program In connection with our fiscal 2024 restructuring plan, we identified the need to address quality and reliability issues in certain models of our PI printers as a result of faulty ink provided by one of our larger suppliers. In order to remedy these issues and maintain solid customer relationships, during the second quarter of fiscal 2024, we initiated a program to retrofit all of the printers sold to our customers that were affected by the faulty ink. Upon initiating this program, we identified approximately printers sold to our customers that were affected by the faulty ink. We began to work with our customers to either repair or replace the affected printers and did this on a gradual basis beginning in the second quarter of fiscal 2024 through March 2024. The initial estimated costs associated with this program at July 29, 2023 were million, which included the cost of parts, labor and travel. Those costs were recognized and recorded in the second quarter of fiscal 2024 and are included in cost of revenue in the accompanying consolidated statement of income for the three and nine months ended October 28, 2023. This program was concluded by the end of fiscal 2024 and there was no balance in the related liability for this program at January 31, 2024.

Revenue for the third quarter of the current year was 40.4 million, representing a 7.7 increase compared to the previous year's third quarter revenue of 37.5 million. Revenue through domestic channels for the third quarter of the current year was 23.5 million, an increase of 12.1 from the prior year s third quarter domestic revenue of 21.0 million. International revenue for the third quarter of the current year was 16.9 million, representing 41.9 of our third quarter revenue and reflecting a 2.1 increase from the previous year's third quarter international revenue. International revenue for the third quarter of the current year reflected a favorable foreign exchange rate impact of 0.2 million. Hardware revenue in the third quarter of the current year was 11.6 million, a 1.2 million or 9.7 decrease compared to the prior year s third quarter hardware revenue of 12.9 million. The current quarter decrease is primarily attributable to a 0.9 million or 16.1 compared to the same period in the prior year, decline in hardware sales in the PI segment. The decrease in the current quarter was also impacted by a 0.4 million or 4.9 decline in hardware sales in the T M segment. The overall decrease in hardware sales 

 24 

was partially offset by the contribution of hardware sales of 1.0 million from our newly acquired subsidiary, MTEX, and an increase in aerospace printer hardware sales in the T M segment. Supplies revenue in the third quarter of the current year was 20.9 million, a 0.9 million or 4.7 increase compared to the prior year s third quarter supplies revenue of 20.0 million. The current quarter increase in supplies revenue is primarily attributable to an increase in sales of Trojan Label supplies in the PI segment. The contribution of supplies sales of 0.6 million from MTEX and increased sales of paper supplies in T M s aerospace product line also impacted the overall increase in supplies revenue for the current quarter. The increase in supplies revenue was partially offset by a decline in supplies sales in both our QuickLabel and Astro Machine product lines in the PI segment. Service and other revenues of 7.9 million in the current quarter increased 3.2 million or 67.5 compared to service and other revenues of 4.7 million in the third quarter of the prior year. The increase in current quarter service and other revenue was primarily attributable to a 3.3 million, or 123.9 compared to the same period in the prior year, increase in aerospace parts and repair revenue in the T M segment. Also factoring into the overall increase in service and other revenue was the contribution from MTEX in the PI segment. The current year's third quarter gross profit was 13.7 million, a 7.2 decrease compared to the prior year s third quarter gross profit of 14.8 million. Current quarter gross profit margin of 33.9 reflects a 5.5 percentage point decrease from the prior year s third quarter gross profit margin of 39.4 . The lower gross profit margin for the current quarter compared to the prior year s third quarter is primarily attributable to higher variance and period costs in the current quarter. Operating expenses for the current quarter were 12.5 million, a 2.3 million or 22.5 increase compared to the prior year s third quarter operating expenses of 10.2 million. The increase in operating expenses for the current quarter was largely impacted by the 1.3 million of operating costs at MTEX. Current quarter selling and marketing expenses were 6.8 million, a 17.5 increase compared to the third quarter of the prior year. The increase for the current quarter was primarily due to increases in AstroNova s legacy business for wages, travel and entertainment, and other expenses, which were partially offset by declines in commissions, outside service and employee bonus expenses. Current quarter general and administrative G A expenses were 3.9 million, a 41.0 increase compared to the third quarter of the prior year, primarily due to an increase in AstroNova s legacy business for wages, outside services, which includes MTEX acquisition costs, and an increase in professional fees, partially offset by a decline in employee bonuses. Research and development R D expenses were 1.8 million in the current quarter, a 9.5 increase compared to the third quarter of the prior year, primarily due to increases in outside testing and supplies and repairs expenses. R D spending as a percentage of revenue for the current quarter was 4.6 as compared to 4.5 for the same period in the prior year. We recognized a federal, state and foreign income tax provision for the third quarter of the current year of 34,000 resulting in an effective tax rate of 12.4 . The effective tax rate in this period was directly impacted by the return to provision associated with our fiscal 2024 federal tax return which resulted in a 157,000 decrease to tax expense, and a tax benefit of 56,000 related to the foreign return to provision differences. During the three months ended October 28, 2023, we recognized a federal, state and foreign income tax expense of 0.9 million resulting in an effective tax rate of 25.6 . The effective tax rate in this period was directly impacted by our jurisdictional mix of earnings. We reported net income of 0.2 million or 0.03 per diluted share for the third quarter of the current year. Net income and net income per diluted share for the quarter ended November 2, 2024 were impacted by transaction costs of 0.3 million 0.3 million net of tax or 0.03 per diluted share), related to the MTEX acquisition. On a comparable basis, net income for the prior year s third quarter was 2.8 million or 0.37 per diluted share.

Revenue for the first nine months of the current year was 113.9 million, representing a 5.0 increase compared to the previous year s first nine months of revenue of 108.5 million. Revenue through domestic channels for the first nine months of the current year was 66.8 million, an increase of 8.2 from prior year s domestic revenue of 61.8 million. International revenue for the first nine months of the current year was 47.1 million, a 0.8 increase from the previous year s international revenue of 46.7 million. There was no foreign exchange rate impact on international revenue for the first nine months of the current year. Hardware revenue in the first nine months of the current year was 32.9 million, a 2.9 million or 8.2 decrease compared to the prior year s first nine months hardware revenue of 35.8 million. The current year's decrease is primarily attributable to the decline in hardware sales in the PI segment, as current year hardware sales in the PI segment were 12.7 million, a decrease of 3.2 million or 20.0 compared to the previous year's PI hardware sales of 15.9 million. This decrease was primarily the result of a delayed release of an OEM printer within our Astro Machine product line. The decrease in PI hardware sales was partially offset by the contribution of hardware of our MTEX business. T M hardware sales for the current year were 20.2 million, a 1.2 increase from the prior year s T M hardware sales of 19.9 million, due to an increase in hardware sales in our aerospace printer product lines. Supplies revenue in the first nine months of the current year was 61.9 million, representing a 3.1 million or 5.3 increase over the prior year s first nine months supplies revenue of 58.7 million, as supplies revenue increased in both the PI and T M segments in the current year. The increase was primarily due to an increase in supplies sales of our Trojan Label products and the contribution of supplies sales from MTEX, both in the PI segment. Also contributing to the increase in the current year s supplies revenue was an increase in paper revenue for the aerospace printer product line in the T M segment. The overall increase in supplies revenue for the current quarter was partially offset by a decline in QuickLabel supplies sales in the PI segment. Service and other revenues were 19.2 million in the first nine months of the current year, a 5.2 million or 37.5 increase compared to the prior year s first nine months of service and other revenues of 13.9 million. The increase is due primarily to a 5.1 million or 63.6 increase in parts and repairs revenue in the aerospace printer product line in the T M segment due to a large backlog of replacement parts that were shipped during the current year. Gross profit for the first nine months of the current year was 40.0 million, an 8.5 increase compared to the prior year s gross profit of 36.9 million. Our gross profit margin of 35.1 in the current year reflects a 1.1 percentage point increase from the prior year s first nine months gross profit margin of 34.0 . The increase in gross profit margin for the current year compared to the prior year is primarily attributable to higher sales, 2.1 million of restructuring costs and 0.9 million of product retrofit costs recognized in the prior year that did not repeat in the current year. Operating expenses for the first nine months of the current fiscal year were 36.3 million, a 4.3 million or a 13.6 increase compared to the prior year s first nine months operating expenses of 32.0 million. The increase in operating expenses for the current year was largely impacted by 2.6 million of operating costs at MTEX. Selling and marketing expenses for the current year were 19.1 million, an increase of 3.7 compared to the previous year s 18.5 million. The increase for the current year was primarily due to increases in employee wages, travel and entertainment and advertising and trade show expenses, partially offset by the impact of restructuring costs that were unique to the prior year. General administrative G A expenses increased 45.0 to 12.3 million in the first nine months of the current year compared to 8.5 million in the first nine months of the prior year, primarily due to an increase in outside services fees, which includes MTEX acquisition costs and CFO transition costs. Also contributing to the increase in G A expenses were increases in employee wages and benefits, and professional fees. R D spending in the first nine months of the current year was 4.9 million, a 3.4 decrease compared to the prior year s first nine months R D spend of 5.0 million, which was primarily due to the decline in employee wages, and was partially offset by increases in fees for outside services, testing and consulting and supplies and repairs fees. Current year spending on R D represents 4.3 of revenue compared to the prior year s first nine months level of 4.6 . We recognized a 0.1 million income tax benefit for the first nine months of the current fiscal year, resulting in an effective tax rate of (14.3) . The effective tax rate in this period was directly impacted by a 281,000 tax benefit related to a previously unrecorded reduction in our future income tax payable balance that should have been discretely recognized in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024, netted against the tax expense related to amending our fiscal year 2023 federal tax return and the current quarter tax 

 26 

benefit related to the return to provision associated with our fiscal year 2024 federal tax return. Additional impacts on the effective tax rate include a 218,000 tax benefit related to foreign return to provision differences and an 88,000 tax benefit arising from windfall tax benefits related to our stock. We recognized 0.7 million of income tax expense for the first nine months of the prior fiscal year, resulting in an effective tax rate of 27.1 . The effective tax rate was directly impacted by our jurisdictional mix of earnings, a 77,000 tax benefit related to the expiration of the statute of limitations on a previously uncertain tax position, a 49,000 tax benefit arising from windfall tax benefits related to our stock, and a 18,000 tax expense related to foreign return to provision differences. We reported net income of 1.1 million, or 0.15 per diluted share, for the first nine months of the current year. Net income and net income per diluted share for the nine months ended November 2, 2024 were impacted by an inventory step up cost of 0.2 million 0.1 million net of tax or 0.01 per diluted share) and transaction costs of 0.9 million 0.7 million net of tax or 0.09 per diluted share), both related to the MTEX acquisition and CFO transition charges of 0.4 million 0.3 million net of tax or 0.05 per diluted share). On a comparable basis, we reported a net income of 2.0 million, or 0.27 per diluted share, for the first nine months of the prior year. The results for this period were impacted by expense of 2.7 million 2.0 million net of tax or 0.28 per diluted share) related to our restructuring plan and expense of 0.9 million 0.7 million net of tax or 0.09 per diluted share) related to our product retrofit program.

Product Identification-PI During the second quarter of the current year we acquired MTEX, a Portugal-based manufacturer of digital printing equipment. Since the closing of that transaction on May 6, 2024, MTEX is reported as a part of our PI segment. Although we remain very excited about the opportunities created by MTEX s complementary product portfolio and anticipate improved overall business and enhanced customer service as we integrate MTEX s advanced technology across other areas of our product portfolio, the integration of MTEX has been more time-consuming and resource-intensive than we originally anticipated. In the course of integrating MTEX into our operations, we have discovered certain facts that we believe may constitute breaches of the representations and warranties included in the definitive agreements governing our acquisition of MTEX. We are continuing to investigate these matters and are seeking remedies from the seller under those agreements. In the third quarter of the current year, MTEX had an operating loss of 1.1 million on revenue of 1.7 million and year-to-date revenue of 2.5 million and an operating loss of 2.4 million. Corporate expense for the third quarter of the current year has increased 1.1 million or 41.0 compared to the same period of the prior year primarily as a result of 0.3 million of MTEX G A expenses that are not allocated to any segment and 0.3 million of fees related to the acquisition of MTEX. Corporate expense for the first nine months of the current year have increased 3.8 million or 45.0 compared to the prior year primarily as a result of 0.7 million of MTEX G A expenses that are not allocated to any segment, 0.9 million of fees related to the acquisition of MTEX and 0.4 million of CFO transition charges. Revenue from the PI segment decreased 0.2 million or 0.9 , in the third quarter of the current year, with revenue of 26.3 million compared to 26.5 million in the same period of the prior year. The current quarter decrease is primarily attributable to a decrease in sales of legacy PI hardware and supply products and a delayed release of an OEM printer within our Astro Machine product line. Initially slated for release in the third quarter, due to the need for additional development time, shipments of the printer did not begin until early in the fourth quarter of the current year. The decline in current quarter revenue was partially offset by an increase in supplies sales in the Trojan Label product line and the contribution of sales of 1.7 million from MTEX. We expect revenue growth will become positive going forward as the delayed shipments of Astro Machine products will be made in the fourth quarter of the current year, along with the continuing contribution from the MTEX acquisition. The PI segment recognized current quarter segment operating income of 1.9 million, reflecting a profit margin of 7.1 . This compares to the prior year s third quarter 

 27 

segment profit of 4.8 million and related margin of 18.1 . The decrease in the current year third quarter PI segment operating profit and margin is primarily due to higher costs in the 2024 period, in part associated with the MTEX acquisition, product mix, lower sales volume in Europe and the delayed Astro Machine product release. Revenue from the PI segment decreased by 0.7 million or 1.0 to 76.7 in the first nine months of the current year from 77.4 million in the same period of the prior year. The current year decrease is primarily attributable to a decrease in sales of legacy PI hardware products and a delayed release of an OEM printer within our Astro Machine product line. The decline in current quarter revenue was partially offset by an increase in supplies sales in the Trojan Label product line and the contribution of 2.5 million of sales from MTEX . The current year's first nine months of PI segment operating profit was 7.2 million with a profit margin of 9.4 , compared to the first nine months of the prior year s segment operating profit of 6.8 million and related profit margin of 8.8 . The increase in current year's PI segment operating profit and margin is primarily due to higher sales, lower manufacturing and period expenses as a result of the impact of the fiscal 2024 restructuring plan and product retrofit program costs that were incurred in the prior year and a favorable product mix. Test Measurement T M Revenue from the T M segment was 14.1 million for the third quarter of the current fiscal year, representing a 3.1 million or 28.2 increase compared to revenue of 11.0 million for the same period in the prior year. The increase in revenue for the current quarter is primarily attributable to an increase in sales of certain of our new, more advanced Tough Writer-branded printers in the aerospace printer product line, as well as increases in supplies, parts and repairs revenue also in our aerospace product lines. Our aerospace product line continues to benefit from strong demand across the commercial aviation sector. The demand for aircraft is increasing due to the recovery of global air travel to pre-pandemic levels and the need for fleet modernization. Airlines are expanding and upgrading their fleets to accommodate rising passenger numbers and to improve efficiency through fuel-saving technologies and, as a result, aircraft manufacturers are increasing production rates to address significant backlogs of orders ,although this trend was tempered in the third quarter of the current year by a machinists strike affecting our customer, The Boeing Company. T M s third quarter segment operating profit was 3.3 million, reflecting a profit margin of 23.0 , compared to the prior year third quarter segment operating profit of 2.6 million and related operating margin of 23.2 . The decrease in T M s current year third quarter segment operating profit margin is due to an increase in manufacturing variance costs and operating expenses. Revenue from the T M segment was 37.3 million for the first nine months of the current fiscal year, a 6.2 million or 19.9 increase compared to sales of 31.1 million for the same period in the prior year. The increase in revenue for the current year was primarily attributable to increased parts and repairs revenue in our aerospace product lines as a result of increased aerospace printer product unit volume. Also contributing to the current year increase was an increase in sales of aerospace printers and related supplies. Demand for printers, especially for narrow-body aircraft, has increased due to the post-pandemic recovery in air travel demand, which has driven new orders of airplanes and a corresponding increase in production rates. T M s first nine months of segment operating profit of 8.8 million resulted in a 23.6 operating margin compared to the prior year s segment operating profit of 6.5 million and related operating margin of 21.1 . The increase in T M s current year segment operating profit and related margin is due to higher sales and a favorable product mix. Liquidity and Capital Resources Overview Historically, our primary sources of liquidity have been cash generated from operating activities and borrowings under our revolving credit facility. These sources have also usually funded the majority of our capital expenditures and contractual contingent consideration obligations. We have funded acquisitions by borrowing under bank term loan facilities. We believe cash flow generation from operations and available unused credit capacity under our revolving credit facility will support our anticipated needs. Additionally, as discussed below, we entered into a revised credit agreement with our lender to finance our acquisition of MTEX. In fiscal 2025 (after required debt amortization and payment of minimum guaranteed royalty payments to Honeywell), we plan to focus on inventory reduction and reduction of debt outstanding under our credit agreement, to the degree practicable and as constrained by supply chain management challenges. In connection with our acquisition of MTEX, on May 6, 2024, we entered a Third Amendment to Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the Amendment with Bank of America, N.A., as lender (the Lender ). The Amendment amended the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated as of July 30, 2020, as amended by the First Amendment to Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated as of March 24, 2021, the LIBOR Transition Amendment, dated as of December 14, 2021, the Second Amendment to Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated as of August 4, 2022, and the Joinder Agreement relating to Astro Machine dated as of August 26, 2022 (as so amended, the Existing Credit Agreement the Existing Credit Agreement as amended by the 

 28 

Amendment, the Amended Credit Agreement ), between AstroNova, Inc. as the borrower, Astro Machine as a guarantor, and the Lender. The Amended Credit Agreement provides for (i) a new term loan to AstroNova, Inc.in the principal amount of EUR 14.0 million (the Term A-2 Loan ), which term loan is in addition to the existing term loan (the Existing Term Loan outstanding under the Existing Credit Agreement in the principal amount of approximately 12.3 million as of the effective date of the Amendment, and (ii) an increase in the aggregate principal amount of the revolving credit facility available to AstroNova, Inc. from 25.0 million to 30.0 million until January 31, 2025, upon and after which the aggregate principal amount of the revolving credit facility will reduce to 25.0 million. At the closing of the Amendment, we borrowed the entire EUR 14.0 million Term A-2 Loan, EUR 3.0 million under the revolving credit facility, and a US dollar amount under the revolving credit facility that was converted to Euros to satisfy the entire purchase price for MTEX payable on the closing date. The revolving credit facility may otherwise be used for general corporate purposes. The revolving credit loans may continue to be borrowed, at our option, in U.S. Dollars or, subject to certain conditions, Euros, British Pounds, Canadian Dollars or Danish Kroner. At November 2, 2024 our cash and cash equivalents were 4.4 million. We have borrowed 20.1 million on our revolving line of credit with Bank of America and have 9.9 million available for borrowing under that facility as of November 2, 2024. Additionally, our recent MTEX acquisition has a EUR 0.5 million 0.5 million) available line of credit with Caixa Central de Cr dito Agricola Mutuo. This credit line was established in December 2023 and is renewable every six months. There was EUR 0.1 million 0.1 million) outstanding on this line of credit as of November 2, 2024. Indebtedness Term Loan The Amended Credit Agreement requires that the Term A-2 Loan be paid in quarterly installments on the last day of each of our fiscal quarters through April 30, 2027 in the principal amount of EUR 583,333 each, and the entire then-remaining principal balance of the Term A-2 Loan is required to be paid on August 4, 2027. The Amended Credit Agreement requires that the remaining balance of the Existing Term Loan be paid in quarterly installments on the last day of each of our fiscal quarters through April 30, 2027 in the principal amount of 675,000 each, and the entire then remaining principal balance of the term loan is required to be paid on August 4, 2027. We may voluntarily prepay the Term A-2 Term Loan or the Existing Term Loan, in whole or in part, from time to time without premium or penalty (other than customary breakage costs, if applicable). We may repay borrowings under the revolving credit facility at any time without premium or penalty (other than customary breakage costs, if applicable), but in any event no later than August 4, 2027, and any outstanding revolving loans thereunder will be due and payable in full, and the revolving credit facility will terminate, on such date. We may reduce or terminate the revolving line of credit at any time, subject to certain thresholds and conditions, without premium or penalty . The loans under the Amended Credit Agreement are subject to certain mandatory prepayments, subject to various exceptions, from net cash proceeds from certain dispositions of property, certain issuances of equity, certain issuances of additional debt and certain extraordinary receipts. Amounts repaid under the revolving credit facility may be reborrowed, subject to our continued compliance with the Amended Credit Agreement. No amount of the Term A-2 Loan or the Existing Term Loan that is repaid may be reborrowed. The Term A-2 Loan bears interest at a rate per annum equal to the EURIBOR rate as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement, plus a margin that varies within a range of 1.60 to 2.50 based on our consolidated leverage ratio. The Existing Term Loan and revolving credit loans bear interest at a rate per annum equal to, at our option, either (a) the Term SOFR rate as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement (or, in the case of revolving credit loans denominated in Euros or another currency other than U.S. Dollars, the applicable quoted rate), plus a margin that varies within a range of 1.60 to 2.50 based on our consolidated leverage ratio, or (b) a fluctuating reference rate equal to the highest of (i) the federal fund rate plus 0.50 , (ii) Bank of America s publicly announced prime rate, (iii) the Term SOFR Rate plus 1.00 , or (iv) 0.50 , plus a margin that varies within a range of 0.60 to 1.50 based on our consolidated leverage ratio. In addition to certain other fees and expenses that we are required to pay to the Lender, we are required to pay a commitment fee on the undrawn portion of the revolving credit facility that varies within a range of 0.15 and 0.35 based on our consolidated leverage ratio. We must comply with various customary financial and non-financial covenants under the Amended Credit Agreement. The financial covenants under the Amended Credit Agreement consist of a maximum consolidated leverage ratio and a minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio, certain of the provisions of which were modified by the Amendment; the minimum consolidated asset coverage ratio under the Existing Credit Agreement was eliminated by the Amendment. The primary non-financial covenants limit our and our subsidiaries ability to incur future indebtedness, to place liens on assets, to pay dividends or distributions on our or our subsidiaries capital stock, to repurchase or acquire our or our subsidiaries capital stock, to conduct mergers or acquisitions, to sell assets, to alter our or our subsidiaries capital structure, to make investments and loans, to change the nature of our or our subsidiaries business, and to prepay subordinated indebtedness, in each case subject to certain exceptions and thresholds as set 

 29 

forth in the Amended Credit Agreement, certain of which provisions were modified by the Amendment. As of November 2, 2024, we believe we are in compliance with all of the covenants in the Credit Agreement. The Lender is entitled to accelerate repayment of the loans and to terminate its revolving credit commitment under the Amended Credit Agreement upon the occurrence of any of various customary events of default, which include, among other events, the following (which are subject, in some cases, to certain grace periods): failure to pay when due any principal, interest or other amounts in respect of the loans, breach of any of our covenants or representations under the loan documents, default under any other of our or our subsidiaries significant indebtedness agreements, a bankruptcy, insolvency or similar event with respect to us or any of our subsidiaries, a significant unsatisfied judgment against us or any of our subsidiaries, or a change of control. Our obligations under the Amended Credit Agreement continue to be secured by substantially all of our personal property assets (including a pledge of the equity interests we hold in ANI Scandinavia ApS, AstroNova GmbH, AstroNova SAS and the Purchaser), subject to certain exceptions, and by a mortgage on our owned real property in West Warwick, Rhode Island, and are guaranteed by, and secured by substantially all of the personal property assets of Astro Machine. Equipment Loan In January 2024, we entered into a secured equipment loan facility agreement with Banc of America Leasing Capital, LLC and borrowed the principal amount of 0.8 million thereunder for the financing of our purchase of production equipment. The loan matures on January 23, 2029, and bears interest at a fixed rate of 7.06 . Assumed Financing Obligations of MTEX In connection with the purchase of MTEX, on the May 6, 2024 closing date of this acquisition we assumed certain existing financing obligations of MTEX that remain outstanding as of November 2, 2024. The long-term debt obligations of MTEX that remain outstanding include a term loan the MTEX Term Loan pursuant to the agreement dated December 22, 2023, (the MTEX Term Loan Agreement between MTEX and Caixa Central de Cr dito Agricola Mutuo. The MTEX Term Loan provides for a term loan in the principal amount of EUR 1.5 million 1.6 million) and requires monthly principal and interest payments totaling EUR 17,402 18,795) commencing in October 2024 continuing through maturity on December 21, 2033, and bears interest at a fixed rate of 6.022 per annum. MTEX has also received government assistance in the form of interest-free loans from government agencies located in Portugal (the MTEX Government Grant Term Loans ). The MTEX Government Grant Term Loans are to be repaid to the applicable government agencies and are classified as long-term debt. The current balance of the MTEX Government Grants Term Loans as of November 2, 2024 is EUR 1.0 million 1.1 million). The MTEX Government Grant Term Loans provide interest-free financing so long as monthly principal payments are made. In the event that MTEX and the applicable government agency renegotiate the payment dates, interest will be calculated according to a rate determined by the government agency as of the date of renegotiation and added to the outstanding principal payments. The MTEX Government Grants Term Loans mature between December 2024 and January 2027. Additionally, we assumed short-term financing obligations of MTEX that remain outstanding as of November 2, 2024, including letters of credit, maturing term loans, and financing arrangements for working capital classified as debt. Cash Flow Our statements of cash flows for the nine months ended November 2, 2024 and October 28, 2023 are included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Net cash provided by operating activities was 2.3 million for the first nine months of fiscal 2025 compared to 5.9 million for the same period of the previous year. The decrease in net cash provided by operations for the first nine months of the current year is primarily due to lower net income offset by a slight increase in cash provided by working capital. Cash provided by operating activities for the first nine months of fiscal 2024 was impacted by 2.0 million of non-cash restructuring costs. Our accounts receivable balance increased to 25.2 million at the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2025 compared to 23.1 million at year end. Excluding the impact of the MTEX acquisition, accounts receivable decreased 1.6 million from year end. Days sales outstanding for the third quarter of the current year increased to 56 days compared to 52 days at year end due to increased aerospace sales which have longer payment terms. Our inventory balance was 48.6 million at the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2025, an increase compared to 46.4 million at year end. Excluding the impact of the MTEX acquisition, inventories decreased 1.4 million from year end. Inventory days on hand decreased to 164 days at the end of the current quarter from 168 days at the prior year end. Our cash position at November 2, 2024, was 4.4 million compared to 4.5 million at year end. The slight decrease in cash during the current quarter was primarily a result of lower cash from operations and cash outflows during the current year, including 19.1 million for the acquisition of MTEX, principal payments on our long term-debt of 6.7 million, payment of our guaranteed 

 30 

royalty obligation of 1.2 million, and cash used for capital expenditures of 1.1 million, which were partially offset by cash inflows during the current year including proceeds from our long-term debt of 15.1 million and net borrowings on our revolving line of credit of 10.8 million. Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies There have been no material changes to our contractual obligations as disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2024, other than those occurring in the ordinary course of business. Critical Accounting Policies, Estimates and Certain Other Matters The preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, and disclosure of commitments and contingencies at the date of the condensed consolidated financial statements and reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. We base these estimates and judgments on factors we believe to be relevant, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The process of determining significant estimates is fact-specific and takes into account factors such as historical experience, current and expected economic conditions, product mix, and in some cases, actuarial and appraisal techniques. We constantly re-evaluate these significant factors and make adjustments where facts and circumstances dictate. While we believe that the factors considered provide a meaningful basis for the accounting policies applied in the preparation of the condensed consolidated financial statements, we cannot guarantee that our estimates and assumptions will be accurate. As the determination of these estimates requires the exercise of judgment, actual results may differ from those estimates, and such differences may be material to our condensed consolidated financial statements. There have been no material changes to the application of critical accounting policies as disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2024. Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements are not statements of historical fact, but rather reflect our current expectations concerning future events and results.

It em 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk During the nine months ended November 2, 2024, there were no material changes to our market risk disclosures as set forth in Part II, Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended January 31, 2024. It em 4. Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures We maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ). Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our senior leadership team, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Our management, under the supervision of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of November 2, 2024 as a result of the material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting described below. Material Weakness in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. As reported in Item 9A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended January 31, 2024, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was ineffective because of the following material weakness: As of January 31, 2024, we did not design or maintain an effective control environment to ensure the accurate and timely reporting of transactions related to our Astro Machine subsidiary, which was acquired August 4, 2022. Plan for Remediation of Material Weakness Our management has discussed the identified material weakness with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. Subsequent to January 31, 2024, we began to implement measures designed to improve internal control over financial reporting and to remediate our material weakness, and we implemented our NetSuite ERP system at our Astro Machine subsidiary, at the beginning of September 2024. We are currently in the process of evaluating and testing this system to ensure that all controls related to this implementation are operating as documented and are effective. Our management believes that when completed, the measures described above will be sufficient to remediate the identified material weakness and strengthen our overall internal control over financial reporting. As our management continues to evaluate and work to enhance our internal control over financial reporting, we may take additional measures to address control deficiencies, or we may modify some of the remediation measures described above. The identified material weakness will not be considered remediated until the applicable remediated controls operate for a sufficient period of time and management has concluded, through testing, that these controls are operating effectively. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting Except for the measures taken to remediate our identified material weakness noted above, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by Rules 13a-15(d) and 15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act that occurred during the fiscal quarter ended November 2, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reportin g.

Risk Factors In addition to the other information set forth in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, one should carefully consider the factors discussed in Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2024, which could materially affect our business, financial condition or future operating results. The risks described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K are not the only risks that could affect our business, as additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or operating results as well as adversely affect the value of our common stock. Except as set forth below, there have been no material updates to the risk factors previously disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2024. W e may not realize the anticipated benefits of past or future acquisitions, divestitures and strategic partnerships, and integration of acquired companies or divestiture of businesses may negatively impact our overall business. We have made strategic investments in other companies, products and technologies, including our August 2022 acquisition of Astro Machine LLC and our May 2024 acquisition of MTEX. We will continue to identify and pursue acquisitions of complementary companies and strategic assets, such as customer bases, products and technology. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify suitable acquisition opportunities. In any acquisition that we complete, we cannot be certain that: 	We will successfully integrate the operations of the acquired business with our own; 	All the benefits expected from such integration will be realized; 	Management s attention will not be diverted or divided, to the detriment of current operations; 	Amortization of acquired intangible assets or possible impairment of acquired intangibles will not have a negative impact on operating results or other aspects of our business; 	Delays or unexpected costs related to the acquisition will not have a detrimental impact on our business, operating results and financial condition; 	Customer dissatisfaction with, or performance problems at, an acquired company will not have an adverse impact on our reputation; 	We will successfully implement effective disclosure controls and internal controls over financial reporting at the acquired business in a timely fashion; and 	Respective operations, management and personnel will be compatible. For example, in the Astro Machine business, revenues are concentrated in a relatively small number of customers. Failure to satisfy the delivery requirements of those customers or to adequately respond to their evolving product requirements could cause us to lose one or more customers which would have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operation due to lower revenue and could result in intangible asset impairment. We have also faced challenges in our efforts to integrate MTEX and Astro Machine into our operations, such as the material weakness we identified relating to our failure to design and maintain an effective control environment to ensure the accurate and timely reporting of transactions of our Astro Machine business. In certain instances, as permitted by applicable law and NASDAQ rules, acquisitions, such as the Astro Machine acquisition, may be consummated without seeking and obtaining shareholder approval, in which case shareholders will not have an opportunity to consider and vote upon the merits of such an acquisition. Although we will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in an acquisition, there can be no assurance that we will properly ascertain or assess such risks. 

 33 

We may also divest certain businesses from time to time. Divestitures will likely involve risks, such as difficulty splitting up businesses, distracting employees, potential loss of revenue and negatively impacting margins, and potentially disrupting customer relationships. A successful divestiture depends on various factors, including our ability to: 	Effectively transfer assets, liabilities, contracts, facilities and employees to the purchaser; 	Identify and separate the intellectual property to be divested from the intellectual property that we wish to keep; and 	Reduce fixed costs previously associated with the divested assets or business. All of these efforts require varying levels of management resources, which may divert our attention from other business operations. Further, if market conditions or other factors lead us to change our strategic direction, we may not realize the expected value from such transactions. If we are not able to successfully integrate or divest businesses, products, technologies or personnel that we acquire or divest, or are not able to realize the expected benefits of our acquisitions, divestitures or strategic partnerships, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.
