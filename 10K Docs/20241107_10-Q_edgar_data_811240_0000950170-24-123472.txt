million in cash paid at closing, subject to working capital adjustments; plus (b) assumption of certain Assumed Liabilities, was the successful bid (the Successful Bid ), and the bid submitted by Sonendo, which was increased from its prior bid to include (a) million in cash paid at closing, subject to working capital adjustments; plus (b) assumption of certain Assumed Liabilities; plus (c) the Delaware Litigation Settlement Value , was the backup bid. The Successful Bid is subject to entry into definitive documentation between the Company and MegaGen. A hearing to consider approval of the results of the Auction is scheduled to take place on November 12, 2024. The filing of the Bankruptcy Petitions constituted an event of default that accelerates the Company s obligations under the following agreements: that certain Credit Agreement, dated November 9, 2018 (as amended, restated, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, the Credit Agreement by and among the Company, the lender parties thereto (each a Lender and together, the Lenders ), and SWK; and those certain standard loan documents required for an unsecured loan, dated as of May 22, 2020 (the SBA Loan by and among the Company and the U.S. Small Business Administration (collectively, the Financial Obligation Agreements ). The Financial Obligation Agreements provide that as a result of the Bankruptcy Petitions, all obligations to pay any debts, principal, interest, fees, expenses, and other amounts due thereunder shall be immediately due and payable. Any efforts to enforce such payment obligations under the Financial Obligation Agreements are automatically stayed as a result of the Bankruptcy Petitions, and the creditors rights of enforcement in respect of the Financial Obligation Agreements are subject to the applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code. Prior to the filing of the Bankruptcy Petitions, the Company incurred 1.2 million in legal and financial advisory services as a result of receiving a Default Notice from our term loan lender, SWK Funding LLC, entering into a Forbearance Agreement, and preparing for the Bankruptcy Petitions. Due to these charges being incurred prior to the filing of the Bankruptcy Petitions, these expenses are presented as non-operating other loss on the Consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Loss. DIP Financing In connection with the Bankruptcy Petitions, the Company filed a motion seeking Bankruptcy Court approval of a debtor-in-possession ("DIP") financing on the terms set forth in that certain Terms and Conditions of Proposed Senior Secured, Super-Priority Debtor-in-Possession Credit Facility (the DIP Term Sheet ), by and among the Company, as a borrower, and SWK Funding LLC ("SWK"), as DIP Lender and Agent. The DIP Term Sheet provides for a senior secured super-priority debtor-in-possession financing (the DIP Financing in an aggregate amount of no less than million. The DIP Financing will become available up to an amount of million upon the satisfaction of customary conditions precedent thereto, including the entry of an order of the Bankruptcy Court approving the DIP Financing on an interim basis. Subject to entry of an order of the Bankruptcy Court approving the DIP Financing on a final basis, the DIP Obligations (as defined in the DIP Term Sheet) will include advanced by SWK to the Debtors between September 3, 2024, and September 30, 2024. The proceeds of the DIP Financing will be used by the Company to (a) fund, after application of all other available cash, post-petition operating expenses and working capital needs of the Company, including, but not limited to, those activities required to remain in, or return to, compliance with laws in accordance with 28 U.S.C. 1930; (b) pay interest, fees and expenses to SWK in accordance with the DIP Term Sheet (whether or not such amounts are reflected in the Budget (as defined in the DIP Term Sheet)); (c) fund fees and expenses incurred in connection with the 363 Sale (as defined in the DIP Term Sheet); (d) pay permitted prepetition claims and adequate protection payments, if any; (e) pay Professional Fees (as defined in the DIP Term Sheet) provided for in the Budget, including funding of the Carve Out (as defined in the DIP Term Sheet); and (f) pay other costs and expenses of administration of the chapter 11 cases. The maturity date of the loans made under the DIP Financing is the date that is one hundred-twenty days after the Petition Date, or such later date to which SWK consents in writing. Subject to certain exceptions, the DIP Financing will be secured by a first priority perfected priming security interest in all of the assets of the Company. The security interests and liens are subject only to certain carve-outs and certain permitted liens, as set forth in the DIP Term Sheet. The DIP Financing is subject to certain milestones, customary covenants, and events of default as set forth in the DIP Term Sheet. Reverse Stock Split At the annual meeting of stockholders held on May 2, 2024 (the "2024 Annual Meeting"), BIOLASE stockholders approved an amendment to BIOLASE s Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended (the "Certificate of Incorporation"), to effect per share (the common stock ), at a ratio between one-for-two (1:2) and

. No official action has been taken to put this reverse stock into effect. Liquidity and Management s Plans - Going Concern The Company incurred losses from operations and used cash in operating activities for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022. The Company s recurring losses, level of cash used in operations, need for additional capital, along with uncertainties surrounding the Company s ability to raise additional capital, especially in light of the fact that our common stock is no longer traded on the Nasdaq, which makes it harder to attract investors and limits the types of financings that can be conducted, and the filing of the Bankruptcy Petitions on October 1, 2024, raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. As such, the financial statements contain certain adjustments that are necessary as the Company is unable to continue as a going concern, which includes the reclassification of certain long term liabilities as current. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had working capital deficit of approximately million with the deficit primarily due to the SWK Loan (as defined below) that is set to mature in May 2025. The Company s principal sources of liquidity as of September 30, 2024 consisted of approximately million in cash and cash equivalents and million of net accounts receivable. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had working capital of approximately million , million in cash and cash equivalents and million of net accounts receivable. The decrease in cash and cash equivalents since December 31, 2023 was primarily due to a net loss of million and principal payments on the Company's term loan of million, partially offset by net proceeds of million from the February 2024 public offering, a million bridge loan from SWK as part of the Forbearance Agreement, million in proceeds from the disposal of property, plant, and equipment, and million in proceeds from the exercise of preferred share warrants. Additional capital requirements may depend on many factors, including, among other things, the rate at which the Company s business grows, demands for working capital, manufacturing capacity, any acquisitions that the Company may pursue, and the outcome of the Bankruptcy Petitions. The Company expects that it will be required to raise capital through either equity or debt offerings. The Company cannot provide assurance that it will be able to successfully enter into any such equity or debt financings in the future or that the required capital would be available on acceptable terms, if at all, or that any such financing activity would not be dilutive to its stockholders.

Transaction Price Allocation The transaction price for a contract is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and recognized as revenue when, or as, each performance obligation is satisfied. For contracts with multiple performance obligations, the Company allocates the contract s transaction price to each performance obligation using the best estimate of the standalone selling price of each distinct good or service in a contract. The primary method used to estimate standalone selling price is the observable price when the good or service is sold separately in similar circumstances and to similar customers. Significant Judgments Revenue is recorded for extended warranties over time as the customer benefits from the warranty coverage. This revenue will be recognized equally throughout the contract period as the customer receives benefits from the Company's promise to provide such services. Revenue is recorded for product training when the customer attends a training program or upon the expiration of the obligation, which is generally after six months. The Company also has contracts that include both the product sales and product training as performance obligations. In those cases, the Company records revenue for product sales at the point in time when the product has been shipped. The customer obtains control of the product when it is shipped, as all shipments are made FOB shipping point, and after the customer selects its shipping method and pays all shipping costs and insurance. The Company has concluded that control is transferred to the customer upon shipment. Accounts Receivable Accounts receivable are stated at estimated net realizable value. The allowance for doubtful accounts is based on an analysis of customer accounts and the Company s historical experience with accounts receivable write-offs. Contract Liabilities The Company performs its obligations under a contract with a customer by transferring products and/or services in exchange for consideration from the customer. The Company typically invoices its customers as soon as control of an asset is transferred and a receivable for the Company is established. The Company, however, recognizes a contract liability when a customer prepays for goods and/or services, and the Company has not transferred control of the goods and/or services.

 Overview 
 BIOLASE, Inc. BIOLASE and, together with its consolidated subsidiaries, the Company, we, our or us is a leading provider of advanced laser systems for the dental industry. We develop, manufacture, market, and sell laser systems that provide significant benefits for dental practitioners and their patients. Our proprietary systems allow dentists, periodontists, endodontists, pediatric dentists, oral surgeons, and other dental specialists to perform a broad range of minimally invasive dental procedures, including cosmetic, restorative, and complex surgical applications. Our laser systems are designed to provide clinically superior results for many types of dental procedures compared to those achieved with drills, scalpels, and other conventional instruments. Potential patient benefits include less pain, fewer shots, faster healing, decreased fear and anxiety, and fewer appointments. Potential practitioner benefits include improved patient care and the ability to perform a higher volume, and wider variety of procedures. 
 32 

We offer two categories of laser system products: Waterlase (all-tissue) systems and diode (soft-tissue) systems. Our flagship brand, the Waterlase, uses a patented combination of water and laser energy and is FDA cleared for over 80 clinical indications to perform most procedures currently performed using drills, scalpels, and other traditional dental instruments for cutting soft and hard tissue. For example, Waterlase safely debrides implants without damaging or significantly affecting surface temperature and is an effective, safe solution for preserving sick implants. In addition, Waterlase disinfects root canals more efficiently than some traditional chemical methods. We offer our diode laser systems to perform soft tissue, pain therapy, and cosmetic procedures, including teeth whitening. As of December 31, 2023, we maintained approximately 241 active and 21 pending United States and international patents, with the majority relating to our Waterlase technology. Our patent portfolio is regularly evaluated, and we strategically prioritize our core patents to ensure optimal intellectual property coverage while minimizing annual maintenance fees. From 1998 through December 31, 2023, we have sold over 47,700 laser systems in over 80 countries around the world, and we believe that Waterlase iPlus is the world s best-selling all-tissue dental laser. Since 1998, we have been the global leading innovator, manufacturer, and marketer of dental laser systems. 
 We also manufacture and sell consumable products and accessories for our laser systems. Our Waterlase and diode systems use disposable laser tips of differing sizes and shapes depending on the procedure being performed. We also market flexible fibers and hand pieces that dental practitioners replace at some point after initially purchasing laser systems. For our Epic line of diode laser systems, we sell teeth whitening gel kits. During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, the sale of lasers accounted for approximately 54 of our total sales, and consumables, accessories, and services accounted for approximately 46 of our total sales. 
 We currently operate in a single reportable business segment. We had net revenues of 10.9 million and 32.5 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively and net revenues of 10.9 million and 35.7 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. We had net losses of 1.4 million and 10.7 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively and 4.6 million and 15.3 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. We had total assets of 27.2 million as of September 30, 2024 and 35.1 million as of December 31, 2023. 
 Business and Outlook 
 Our Waterlase systems precisely cut hard tissue, bone, and soft tissue with minimal or no damage to surrounding tissue and dental structures. Our diode systems, which include the Epic system, are designed to complement our Waterlase systems, and are used only in soft tissue procedures, pain therapy, hygiene, and cosmetic applications, including teeth whitening. The diode systems, together with our Waterlase systems, offer practitioners a broad product line with a range of features and price points. 
 We also manufacture and sell consumable products and accessories for our laser systems. Our Waterlase and diode systems use disposable laser tips of differing sizes and shapes depending on the procedure being performed. We also market flexible fibers and hand pieces that dental practitioners replace at some point after initially purchasing laser systems. For our Epic systems, we sell teeth whitening gel kits. 
 Due to the limitations associated with traditional and alternative dental instruments, we believe there is a large market opportunity for all-tissue dental laser systems that provide superior clinical outcomes, reduce the need to use anesthesia, help reduce trauma, pain, and discomfort associated with dental procedures, and increase patient acceptance for treatment protocols. 
 Our strategy is to increase awareness and demand for (i) our products among dental practitioners by educating dental practitioners and patients about the clinical benefits of our product suite and (ii) our laser systems among patients by educating patients about the clinical benefits of the Waterlase and diode systems. An important goal of ours is to increase consumables revenue by selling more single-use accessories used by dental practitioners when performing procedures using our dental laser systems. In the short term, we are striving for operating excellence through lean enterprise initiatives, with a specific focus on our sales strategy and cash flow management, coupled with optimizing our engineering capabilities to develop innovative new products. 
 We also seek to create value through innovation and leveraging existing technologies into adjacent medical applications. We plan to expand our product line and clinical applications by developing enhancements and transformational innovations, including new clinical solutions for dental applications and for other adjacent medical applications. In particular, we believe that our existing technologies can provide significant improvements over existing standards of care in fields including ophthalmology, otolaryngology, orthopedics, podiatry, pain management, aesthetics/dermatology, veterinary, and consumer products. We plan to continue to explore potential collaborations to apply our proprietary laser technologies with expanded FDA-cleared indications to other medical applications in the future. 
 The Company experienced revenue decline of 1 and 9 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same period in 2023.

 The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America GAAP which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed consolidated financial statements and revenues and expenses reported during the period. Information with respect to our critical accounting policies that we believe could have the most significant effect on our reported results and require subjective or complex judgments by management is contained in Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, of the 2023 Form 10-K. There have been no significant changes during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 in our critical accounting policies from those disclosed in Item 7 of the 2023 Form 10-K.

Non-GAAP Disclosure 
 In addition to the financial information prepared in conformity with GAAP, we provide certain historical non-GAAP financial information. Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures assist investors in making comparisons of period-to-period operating results and that, in some respects, are indicative of our ongoing core performance. 
 Management believes that the presentation of this non-GAAP financial information provides investors with greater transparency and facilitates comparison of operating results across a broad spectrum of companies with varying capital structures, compensation strategies, derivative instruments, and amortization methods, which provides a more complete understanding of our financial performance, competitive position, and prospects for the future. However, the non-GAAP financial measures presented in this Form 10-Q have certain limitations in that they do not reflect all of the costs associated with the operations of our business as determined in accordance with GAAP. Therefore, investors should consider non-GAAP financial measures in addition to, and not as a substitute for, or as superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. Further, the non-GAAP financial measures presented by us may be different from similarly named non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. 
 Adjusted EBITDA 
 Management uses Adjusted EBITDA in its evaluation of our core results of operations and trends between fiscal periods and believes that these measures are important components of its internal performance measurement process. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net loss before interest, taxes, depreciation, stock-based and other non-cash compensation, severance expense, change in allowance for doubtful accounts, increase in inventory reserves, stock warrant issuance costs, and loss on warrants. Management uses Adjusted EBITDA in its evaluation of our core results of operations and trends between fiscal periods and believes that these measures are important components of its internal performance measurement process. Therefore, investors should consider non-GAAP financial measures in addition to, and not as a substitute for, or as superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with

Typically, we experience fluctuations in revenue from quarter to quarter due to seasonality. Revenue in the first quarter typically is lower than average, and revenue in the fourth quarter typically is higher than average, due to the buying patterns of dental practitioners. We believe that this trend exists because a significant number of dentists purchase their capital equipment towards the end of the calendar year in order to maximize their practice earnings while seeking to minimize their taxes. They often use certain tax incentives, such as accelerated depreciation methods for purchasing capital equipment, as part of their year-end tax planning. In addition, revenue in the third quarter may be affected by vacation patterns which can cause revenue to be flat or lower than in the 
 37 

second quarter of the year. Our historical seasonal fluctuations may also be impacted by sales promotions used by large dental distributors that encourage end-of-quarter and end-of-year buying in our industry. 
 Net revenue decreased by 0.1 million, or 1 , during the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023 primarily due to a decrease in laser systems sales from the impact of the current macro-economic environment causing extended sales cycles, which includes elevated interest rates, partially offset by an increase in consumables and other revenue from improved utilization of installed laser systems. Net revenue was 10.9 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

Gross profit as a percentage of net revenue typically fluctuates with product and regional mix, selling prices, product costs and revenue levels. Gross profit for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was 4.4 million, or 40 of net revenue, which was higher than a gross profit of 3.7 million, or 34 of net revenue, for the same period in 2023. The 6 increase in gross profit as a percentage of net revenue when compared to the same period in 2023 reflects an improvement in supply chain issues that resulted in a decrease to warranty reserves, service expense and freight charges during the three months ended September 30, 2024.

Sales and Marketing Expense . Sales and marketing expenses during the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by 0.5 million, or 15 , as compared to the same period in 2023. This decrease is primarily due to lower compensation expenses from the impact of our cost savings initiatives implemented during the first quarter of 2024, as well as a decrease in commissions and bonus incentives when compared to the same period in 2023. 
 General and Administrative Expense . General and administrative expenses during the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by 1.4 million, or 52 , compared to the same period in 2023. This decrease is due to the reversal of expenses for annual bonus incentives during the three months ended September 30, 2024 from not achieving financial performance targets, as well as less legal, consulting and investor relations activity from our special shareholder meeting held during the third quarter of 2023 to obtain approval for our reverse stock split that did not reoccur in the third quarter of 2024. 
 Engineering and Development Expense . Engineering and development expenses during the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by 0.4 million, or 33 , compared to the same period in 2023. This decrease is primarily due to lower compensation expenses from the impact of our cost savings initiatives implemented during the first quarter of 2024, as well as the reversal of expenses for annual bonus incentives during the three months ended September 30, 2024 from not achieving financial performance targets. 
 Non-Operating Income (Loss) 
 Loss on Foreign Currency Transactions. We realized an approximately 0.1 million loss on foreign currency transactions during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to an approximately 0.3 million loss on foreign currency transactions during the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to exchange rate fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and Euro, as well as other foreign currencies. 
 38 

Interest Expense, Net. Interest expense was 0.6 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 which was consistent with the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Other Income (Expense), Net . Other Expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 47 thousand and relates to 1.2 million in legal and financial advisory services incurred as a result of receiving a Default Notice from our term loan lender, SWK Funding LLC, and entering into a Forbearance Agreement. Under the Forbearance Agreement, the Company agreed to, among other things, prepare for and file a bankruptcy case under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware for the sale of the Company s assets. In connection with the sale process the Company agreed to comply with certain process milestones which require, among other things, the entry into a purchase and sale agreement with a so-called stalking horse bidder by September 30, 2024, filing a bankruptcy case by October 1, 2024, and closing the sale by November 15, 2024. These expenses were partially offset by 1.1 million of gains recorded on the revaluation of liability classified stock warrants as well as the Series J and H warrants, and 0.1 million of gains recorded upon the sale of property, plant, and equipment during the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Income Tax Provision. We use a discrete year-to-date method in calculating quarterly provision for income taxes. Our provision for income taxes for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was consistent with the same period in 2023. For additional information regarding income taxes, see Part I, Item I, Note 13 Income Taxes. 
 Net Loss. For the reasons stated above, our net loss totaled approximately 1.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to a net loss of 4.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023.

Gross profit as a percentage of net revenue typically fluctuates with product and regional mix, selling prices, product costs and revenue levels. Gross profit for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was 12.3 million, or 38 of net revenue, which was slightly lower than a gross profit of 13.2 million, or 37 of net revenue, for the same period in 2023. Lower overall sales volume during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 contributed to the decrease in gross profit. The 1 increase in gross profit as a percentage of revenue when compared to the same period in 2023 reflects the improvement in supply chain issues that resulted in a decrease to warranty reserves, service expense and freight charges, partially offset by higher depreciation expense from facilities and manufacturing equipment placed into service during the three months ended September 30, 2023.

Sales and Marketing Expense . Sales and marketing expenses during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by 4.3 million, or 30 , as compared to the same period in 2023. This decrease is primarily due to 2.2 million in lower compensation expense from the impact of our cost savings initiatives implemented over the last year and from lower commissions and bonus incentives, a 0.7 million decrease in depreciation expense recognized for equipment used in sales and marketing for demos, training and educational purposes, which was non-recurring in the nine months ended September 30, 2023, a 0.7 million decrease in travel and tradeshow related costs, a 0.2 million decrease in advertising costs, 0.1 million in severance expenses that did not occur in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 0.4 million less in various other expenses when compared to the same period in 2023. 
 General and Administrative Expense . General and administrative expenses of 7.5 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was consistent when compared to the same period in 2023. Compensation and bonus incentives decreased by 0.5 million from the impact of cost savings initiatives implemented during the latter part of the second quarter of 2023, which was offset by a 0.2 million increase in our allowance for doubtful accounts reserve, and 0.3 million in higher legal, audit and consulting expenses. 
 Engineering and Development Expense . Engineering and development expenses during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by 1.1 million, or 25 , compared to the same period in 2023. This decrease is primarily due to 0.5 million in lower compensation expense from the impact of our cost savings initiatives implemented over the last year, and fewer engineering projects for 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023, resulting in a 0.2 million decrease in legal and consulting expenses, and a 0.4 million decrease in other miscellaneous costs. 
 Non-Operating Income (Loss) 
 Loss on Foreign Currency Transactions. We realized an approximately 0.3 million loss on foreign currency transactions during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to an approximately 0.5 million loss on foreign currency transactions during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to exchange rate fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and Euro, as well as other foreign currencies.

In addition, there was 0.8 million of issuance costs from the February 2024 public offering that were allocated to the Class A Common Warrants, Class B Common Warrants, and Investor warrants and immediately expensed due to the liability classification of the warrants. These expenses were partially offset by 1.6 million of gains recorded on the revaluation of liability classified stock warrants, as well as the Series J and H warrants, and 0.3 million of gains recorded upon the sale of property, plant, and equipment during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Income Tax Provision. We use a discrete year-to-date method in calculating quarterly provision for income taxes. Our provision for income taxes for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was consistent with the same period in 2023.

 As of September 30, 2024, we had approximately 3.4 million in cash and cash equivalents compared to 6.6 million as of December 31, 2023. Management defines cash and cash equivalents as highly liquid deposits with original maturities of 90 days or less when purchased. The decrease in cash and cash equivalents from December 31, 2023 was primarily due to cash used in operating activities of 11.1 million and principal payments on our term loan of 0.9 million, partially offset by net proceeds of 5.8 million from the February 2024 public offering, a 2.5 million bridge loan from SWK as part of the Forbearance Agreement, 0.4 million in proceeds from the disposal of property, plant, and equipment, and proceeds of 0.3 million from the exercise of preferred share warrants.

Operating Activities 
 Net cash used in operating activities consists of our net loss, adjusted for our non-cash charges, plus or minus working capital changes. Cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 totaled 11.1 million and was primarily comprised of our net loss of 10.7 million. 
 Investing Activities 
 Cash provided by investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 totaled 0.3 million and was comprised of the proceeds from the disposal of property, plant, and equipment. 
 Financing Activities 
 Net cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 totaled 7.7 million and was derived from 5.8 million in net proceeds from the February 2024 public offering, a 2.5 million bridge loan from SWK as part of the 
 41 

Forbearance Agreement, and 0.3 million from the exercise of preferred share warrants, partially offset by 0.9 million principal payments on our term loan. 
 Effect of Exchange Rate 
 The 22 thousand effect of exchange rate on cash for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was due to recognized loss on foreign currency transactions, primarily driven by changes in the Euro during the period. 
 Future Liquidity Needs 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had a working capital deficit of approximately 11.4 million. Our principal sources of liquidity as of September 30, 2024 consisted of approximately 3.4 million in cash and cash equivalents and 3.5 million of net accounts receivable. 
 The Company will need to raise additional capital in the future. Additional capital requirements may depend on many factors, including, among other things, the rate at which the Company s business grows, demands for working capital, manufacturing capacity, and any acquisitions that the Company may pursue. The Company expects that it will be required to raise capital through either equity or debt offerings. The Company cannot provide assurance that it will be able to successfully enter into any such equity or debt financings in the future or that the required capital will be available on acceptable terms, if at all, or that any such financing activity will not be dilutive to its stockholders especially in light of the fact that our common stock is no longer traded on the Nasdaq, which makes it harder to attract investors and limits the types of financings that can be conducted. 
 The Company has historically experienced losses from operations and has used cash and cash equivalents in operating activities. To be able to discharge our liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business, we must increase sales of our products, control or potentially reduce expenses, and establish profitable operations in order to generate cash from operations or obtain additional funds when needed. 
 The Company s recurring losses, level of cash used in operations, and potential need for additional capital, along with uncertainties surrounding the Company s ability to raise additional capital, and the filing of the Bankruptcy Petitions raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern. 
 Despite the February 2024 public offering, as well as the 2.5 million bridge loan from SWK as part of the DIP Financing, in order for the Company to continue operations beyond the next 12 months and be able to discharge its liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business, it must either raise additional capital or increase sales of our products, control or potentially reduce expenses, and establish profitable operations in order to generate cash from operations or obtain additional funds when needed. 
 We will endeavor to improve our financial condition and ultimately improve our financial results by increasing revenues through expansion of our product offerings, continuing to expand and develop our field sales force and distributor relationships both domestically and internationally, forming strategic arrangements within the dental and medical industries, educating dental and medical patients as to the benefits of our advanced medical technologies, and reducing expenses; however, there is no assurance that will be able to improve our financial condition.

 42 

price of 0.001 per share, (B) one Class A Common Warrant, and (C) one Class B Common Warrant. The Units were sold at the public offering price of 0.44 per Unit and the Pre-Funded Units were sold at the public offering price of 0.439 per Pre-Funded Unit. The Company received gross proceeds of approximately 7.0 million, before deducting placement agent fees, estimated offering expenses, and before the exercise of warrants.

 ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 Not applicable. 
 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Our management has evaluated, with the participation of our President and Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The term disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on that evaluation, our President and Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report. 
 As discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, we identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting as we have determined that our controls were not operating effectively to assess the proper presentation of net loss per share attributable to common stockholders for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 and the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. This material weakness was the result of insufficient accounting assessment for unique and complex transactions outside of the business's normal operations. 
 A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. 
 In light of this material weakness, we performed additional analysis as deemed necessary to ensure that our financial statements were prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles for the period ended December 31, 2023 and management believes that the financial statements included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K present fairly in all material respects our financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented. 
 Changes in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting 
 There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the period covered by this report that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting, except for the remediation of the material weakness identified in prior period as discussed blow. 
 43 

To remediate the aforementioned material weakness, management has implemented additional controls to ensure that financial statement presentation, specifically in relation to net loss per share attributable to common stockholders, for unique and complex transactions are sufficiently investigated and documented at the time of inception, and technical experts are engaged for advisement. 
 44 

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 
 Unless specifically noted or the context clearly requires otherwise, all information set forth in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q relates to the Company as it existed as of September 30, 2024 and prior to the Company s bankruptcy proceedings and does not, and is not intended and should not be read to, reflect the business, financial condition, and results of operations of any other entity, including any entity which may result from the bankruptcy proceedings. 
 ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
 From time to time, we are involved in legal proceedings and regulatory proceedings arising out of our operations. We establish reserves for specific liabilities in connection with legal actions that we deem to be probable and estimable. The ability to predict the ultimate outcome of such matters involves judgments, estimates, and inherent uncertainties. The actual outcome of such matters could differ materially from management s estimates. 
 On January 4, 2023, Plaintiff PIPStek, LLC (a wholly-owned subsidiary of Sonendo, Inc.) filed a lawsuit against BIOLASE, Inc. in the Federal District Court for the District of Delaware, alleging that BIOLASE s Waterlase dental laser product infringes two PIPStek patents. A third patent was subsequently added to the case. The Complaint seeks unspecified damages and injunctive relief, as well as costs and attorneys fees against BIOLASE. BIOLASE has answered denying all of PIPStek s allegations and also asserting that the asserted patents are invalid and not infringed. BIOLASE intends to continue to vigorously and fully defend itself against PIPStek s claims. The parties have exchanged preliminary contentions. Trial in this matter is currently set for May 12, 2025. 
 ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 
 Except as set forth below, there have been no material changes to our risk factors from those disclosed under Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of the 2023 Form 10-K. The risks and uncertainties described in the 2023 Form 10-K and set forth below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations. 
 Due to our accumulated deficit, recurring and negative cash flow from operations for the year ended December 31, 2023 and the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. 
 Our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023 were prepared on a going concern basis in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The going concern basis assumes that we will continue in operation for the next 12 months and will be able to realize our assets and discharge our liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. Thus, our consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if we are unable to continue as a going concern. Our recurring losses, negative cash flow, need for additional capital, and the uncertainties surrounding our ability to raise such capital raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. For us to continue operations beyond the next 12 months and be able to discharge our liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business, we must sell our products directly to end-users and through distributors, establish profitable operations through increased sales, decrease expenses, generate cash from operations or raise additional funds when needed. Our goal is to improve our financial condition and ultimately improve our financial results by increasing revenues through expanding awareness of the benefits of our dental lasers among dental specialists and general practitioners and reducing expenses. However, if we are unable to do so on a timely basis, we will be required to seek additional capital. In that event, we would seek additional funds through various financing sources, including the sale of our equity and debt securities, however, there can be no guarantees that such funds will be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all especially in light of the fact that our common stock is no longer traded on the Nasdaq, which makes it harder to attract investors and limits the types of financings that can be conducted. If we are unable to raise additional capital, increase sales or reduce expenses, we will be unable to continue to fund our operations, develop our products, realize value from our assets, and discharge our liabilities in the normal course of business. If we become unable to continue as a going concern, we could have to liquidate our assets, and potentially realize significantly less than the values at which they are carried on our financial statements, and stockholders could lose all or part of their investment in our common stock. The Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm from Macias Gini O Connell LLP contains an explanatory paragraph regarding our ability to continue as a going concern. In addition, the notes to our financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q states that our recurring losses, level of cash used in operations, and potential need for additional capital, along with uncertainties surrounding our ability to raise additional capital, raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. 
 We are subject to risks and uncertainties associated with the bankruptcy proceedings. 
 The bankruptcy proceedings could have a material adverse effect on the Company s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. So long as the bankruptcy proceedings continue, our senior management may be required to spend a significant amount of time and effort dealing with bankruptcy proceedings instead of focusing on our business operations. The 
 45 

bankruptcy proceedings also may make it more difficult to retain management and the key personnel necessary to the success and growth of our business. In addition, during the period of time we are involved in the bankruptcy proceedings, our customers and suppliers may lose confidence in our ability to restructure our business and may seek to establish alternative commercial relationships. 
 Other significant risks associated with the bankruptcy proceedings that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows include or relate to the following, among others: 
 our ability to obtain approval from the Bankruptcy Court with respect to motions or other requests made to the Bankruptcy Court in the Bankruptcy Petitions; 

our ability to obtain approval from the Bankruptcy Court with respect to the results of the Auction; 

our ability to confirm and consummate the plan of reorganization; 

our ability to consummate the sale of the Transferred Assets; 

the effects of the filing of the Bankruptcy Petitions on our business and the interests of various constituents, including our stockholders; 

the high costs of the bankruptcy proceedings and related fees; 

our ability to maintain relationships with payors, suppliers, employees, and other third parties as a result of the Bankruptcy Petitions; 

Bankruptcy Court rulings in the Bankruptcy Petitions as well as the outcome of other pending litigation and the outcome of the Bankruptcy Petitions in general; 

the length of time that we will operate with chapter 11 protection; 

the sufficiency of the Company s cash on hand and ability to obtain sufficient financing to allow us to conduct our business during the pendency of the bankruptcy proceedings, confirm a plan of reorganization, or sell some or all of our assets during the bankruptcy proceedings in orderly fashion; 

third-party motions in the Bankruptcy Petitions, which may interfere with our ability to confirm and consummate the plan of reorganization or another restructuring transaction, including motions by third parties that may force us into chapter 7 proceedings under the Bankruptcy Code, rather than chapter 11 proceedings; and 

our ability to continue as a going concern. 

Because of the risks and uncertainties associated with the bankruptcy proceedings, we may not be able to accurately predict or quantify the ultimate impact the bankruptcy proceedings may have on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, nor can we accurately predict the ultimate impact the bankruptcy proceedings may have on our corporate or capital structure. 
 We have experienced net losses for each of the quarter ended September 30, 2024 and the past three years, and we could experience additional losses and have difficulty achieving profitability in the future. 
 We had an accumulated deficit of 327.5 million as of September 30, 2024 and an accumulated deficit of 316.8 million as of December 31, 2023. We recorded net losses of 20.6 million and 28.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and net losses of 10.7 million and 15.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. In order to achieve profitability, we must increase net revenue through new sales and control our costs. Failure to increase our net revenue and decrease our costs could cause our stock price to decline and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 
 The National Securities Markets Improvement Act of 1996, which is a federal statute, prevents or preempts the states from regulating the sale of certain securities, which are referred to as covered securities. Because our Common Stock is not listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market, our Common Stock is not a covered security and therefore we are subject to regulation in each state in which we offer our securities. Accordingly, the types of financings that we may engage in are limited. 
 46 

Because of the trading volatility often associated with low-priced stocks not listed on a national securities exchange, many brokerage houses and institutional investors have internal policies and practices that either prohibit them from investing in low-priced stocks or tend to discourage individual brokers from recommending low-priced stocks to their customers. Some of those policies and practices may make the processing of trades in low-priced stocks economically unattractive to brokers. Additionally, because brokers commissions on low-priced stocks generally represent a higher percentage of the stock price than commissions on higher-priced stocks, a low average price per share of common stock can result in individual stockholders paying transaction costs representing a higher percentage of their total share value than would be the case if the share price were higher. 
 
 As a result of Nasdaq delisting our securities from trading on its exchange, we could face significant material adverse consequences, including: 
 a limited availability of market quotations for our securities: 

reduced liquidity with respect to our securities; 

a determination that our common stock is a "penny stock" which will require brokers trading in our common stock to adhere to more stringent rules, possibly resulting in a reduced level of trading activity in the secondary trading market for our common stock; 

a limited amount of news and analyst coverage for our company; and 

a decreased ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future. 

Our common stock is subject to the penny stock rules of the SEC and the trading market in the securities is limited, which makes transactions in the stock cumbersome and may reduce the value of an investment in the stock. 
 
 Rule 15g-9 under the Exchange Act, establishes the definition of a penny stock, for the purposes relevant to us, as any equity security that has a market price of less than 5.00 per share or with an exercise price of less than 5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions. For any transaction involving a penny stock, unless exempt, the rules require: (a) that a broker or dealer approve a person s account for transactions in penny stocks; and (b) the broker or dealer receive from the investor a written agreement to the transaction, setting forth the identity and quantity of the penny stock to be purchased. 
 In order to approve a person s account for transactions in penny stocks, the broker or dealer must: (a) obtain financial information and investment experience objectives of the person and (b) make a reasonable determination that the transactions in penny stocks are suitable for that person and the person has sufficient knowledge and experience in financial matters to be capable of evaluating the risks of transactions in penny stocks. 
 The broker or dealer must also deliver, prior to any transaction in a penny stock, a disclosure schedule prescribed by the SEC relating to the penny stock market, which, in highlight form: (a) sets forth the basis on which the broker or dealer made the suitability determination; and (b) confirms that the broker or dealer received a signed, written agreement from the investor prior to the transaction. Generally, brokers may be less willing to execute transactions in securities subject to the penny stock rules. This may make it more difficult for investors to dispose of our common stock and cause a decline in the market value of our common stock. 
 Disclosure also has to be made about the risks of investing in penny stocks in both public offerings and in secondary trading and about the commissions payable to both the broker or dealer and the registered representative, current quotations for the securities and the rights and remedies available to an investor in cases of fraud in penny stock transactions. Finally, monthly statements have to be sent disclosing recent price information for the penny stock held in the account and information on the limited market in penny stocks.
