 million and million, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of billion. Although we generate revenue from the sale of our Products, we expect to continue to incur operating losses for the foreseeable future. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had a working capital surplus of million and capital resources of million consisting of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments. To date, we have funded our operations primarily through the sale of common stock, convertible senior notes, sales of Products, proceeds from notes issued pursuant to the Note Purchase Agreement, and payments received from collaboration arrangements. We also have a remaining capacity to sell up to million of our common stock under the 2022 ATM Agreement as of September 30, 2024. 
 In accordance with ASC 205-40, Presentation of Financial Statements Going Concern , we are required to evaluate whether there are conditions and events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern for at least 12 months from the issuance date of our financial statements. Our forecasted liquidity is based on our current operating plan and excludes any impact from the pending consummation of the Merger. Based on that plan and excluding any impact of the pending consummation of the Merger, our existing cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments will not allow us to fund our operations for at least 12 months following the filing of this Report. Also, we are required to maintain compliance with the Minimum Cash Covenant in accordance with the terms of the Note Purchase Agreement (see Note 10 ). As a result, management has concluded that there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. 
 In order to mitigate the substantial doubt to continue as a going concern, we may be required to refinance our debt, conduct additional financings, restructure operations, sell assets or reduce our operating expenses. If we are unable to generate sufficient revenue to fulfill our operating plan, secure additional capital when needed or sufficiently reduce our operating expenses, we may be unable to comply with the Minimum Cash Covenant or continue to operate our business. 
 The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of the business. The condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

As a result of discussions between the Company and Teoxane regarding an alleged breach of the Teoxane Agreement, the Buyer Parties extended the date by which Merger Sub was obligated to commence the tender offer for all of the Shares pursuant to the Merger Agreement. The Company and Crown agreed to extend the Offer commencement date to November 12, 2024. The Merger Agreement contemplates that, as soon as practicable following the consummation of the Offer, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub will be merged with and into the Company, with the Company surviving as a wholly owned subsidiary of Crown. The Offer has not commenced. If the Offer commences, consummation of the Offer and closing of the Merger will remain subject to customary closing conditions, including i) the Minimum Condition; (ii) the absence of any order, injunction or law prohibiting the Offer or the closing of the Merger; (iii) obtaining applicable approvals under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, which approval has already been received; and (iv) the accuracy of the representations and warranties contained in the Merger Agreement, subject to customary materiality qualifications, and compliance with the covenants and agreements contained in the Merger Agreement as of the closing of the Merger.

 Concurrently with the 2027 Notes, we entered into capped call transactions with the option counterparties and used the net proceeds from the 2027 Notes to pay the cost of the capped call transactions. See Note 10 for additional information. Prior to the effective time of the pending Merger, we have agreed to cooperate with, and assist Crown, upon Crown s request, in terminating our outstanding capped call confirmations (collectively, the capped calls at, or as promptly as practicable following, the effective time. Prior to the effective time of the Merger, we have also agreed to reasonably cooperate with and assist Crown in connection with discussions, negotiations or agreements with the counterparties to the capped calls with respect to any determination, adjustment, cancellation, termination, exercise, settlement or computation in connection with the capped calls, including with respect to any cash amounts or shares of our common stock that may be receivable by us pursuant to the capped calls.

 Viatris has paid us an aggregate of million in non-refundable upfront and milestone fees as of September 30, 2024, and the agreement provides for additional remaining contingent payments of up to million in the aggregate, upon the achievement of certain clinical and regulatory milestones and of specified, tiered sales milestones of up to million. The payments do not represent a financing component for the transfer of goods or services. In addition, Viatris is required to pay us low to mid-double digit royalties on any sales of the biosimilar in the U.S., mid-double digit royalties on any sales in Europe, and high single-digit royalties on any sales in other ex-U.S. Viatris territories. However, we have agreed to waive royalties for U.S. sales, up to a maximum of million in annual sales, during the first approximately after commercialization to defray launch costs. 
 Revenue Recognition 
 We estimated the transaction price for the Viatris Agreement using the most likely amount method within the scope of ASC 606. In order to determine the transaction price, we evaluated all of the payments to be received during the duration of the contract, which included milestones and consideration payable by Viatris. Other than the upfront payment, all other milestones and consideration we may earn under the Viatris Agreement are subject to uncertainties related to development achievements, Viatris rights to terminate the agreement, and estimated effort for cost-sharing payments. Components of such estimated effort for cost-sharing payments include both internal and external costs. Consequently, the transaction price does not include any milestones and considerations that, if included, could result in a probable significant reversal of revenue when related uncertainties become resolved. At the end of each reporting period, we re-evaluate the probability of achievement of each such milestone and any related constraint, and if necessary, adjust our estimates of the overall transaction price. Sales-based milestones and royalties are not included in the transaction price until the sales occur because the underlying value

 million. 
 We recognize revenue and estimate deferred revenue based on the cost of development service incurred over the total estimated cost of development services to be provided for the development period. For revenue recognition purposes, the development period has an estimated accounting program end date of 2030. It is possible that this period will change and is assessed at each reporting date. ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASC 606) requires that an entity include a constraint on the amount of variable consideration included in the transaction price. Variable consideration is considered constrained if there is a potential for significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized. As part of the constraint evaluation, we considered numerous factors, including a shift in certain responsibilities between the two parties which would result in changes to the net cost sharing payments and the total project budget, for which outcomes are difficult to predict as of the date of this Report. We will continue to evaluate the variable transaction price and related revenue recognition in each reporting period and as the above uncertainties are resolved or other changes in circumstances occur. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized revenue related to development services under the Viatris Agreement of million and million, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, collaboration revenue is recognized from the biosimilar program. 
 Fosun License Agreement 
 Agreement Terms 
 In December 2018, we entered into the Fosun License Agreement with Fosun, whereby we granted Fosun the exclusive rights to develop and commercialize DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection in the Fosun Territory and certain sublicense rights. 
 As of September 30, 2024, Fosun has paid us non-refundable upfront and other payments totaling million before foreign withholding taxes. Upon China s NMPA approval of DAXXIFY for the improvement of glabellar lines in September 2024, Fosun was obligated to pay us a milestone payment of million, net of million foreign withholding taxes, which we received in October 2024. We are also eligible to receive (i) additional remaining contingent payments of up to million upon the achievement of certain milestones, and (ii) tiered royalty payments in low double digits to high teen percentages on annual net sales. The royalty percentages are subject to reduction in the event that (i) we do not have any valid and unexpired patent claims that cover the product in the Fosun Territory, (ii) biosimilars of the product are sold in the Fosun Territory or (iii) Fosun needs to pay compensation to third-parties to either avoid patent infringement or market the product in the Fosun Territory. 
 Revenue Recognition 
 We estimated the transaction price for the Fosun License Agreement using the most likely amount method. We evaluated all of the variable payments to be received during the duration of the contract, which included payments from specified milestones, royalties, and estimated supplies to be delivered. We will re-evaluate the transaction price at each reporting period and upon a change in circumstances. As of September 30, 2024, the transaction price allocated to unfulfilled performance obligation is million. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, revenue was recognized from the Fosun License Agreement. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recognized revenue of less than million and million, respectively, related to the Fosun License Agreement. 
 We will recognize revenue on the single performance obligation as control of DAXXIFY is supplied to Fosun. Upon commencement of the transfer of control, revenue will be recognized in a pattern consistent with estimated deliveries of DAXXIFY through the term of the arrangement, which is estimated to extend through 2040. It is possible that this period will change and is assessed at each reporting date.

 million, pursuant to the Indenture. The 2027 Notes are senior unsecured obligations and bear interest at a rate of per year, payable semiannually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year, began on August 15, 2020. The 2027 Notes will mature on February 15, 2027, unless earlier converted, redeemed or repurchased. In connection with issuing the 2027 Notes, we received million in net proceeds, after deducting the initial purchasers discount, commissions, and other issuance costs. 
 The 2027 Notes may be converted at any time by the holders prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding November 15, 2026 only under the following circumstances: (i) during any fiscal quarter commencing after the fiscal quarter ending on June 30, 2020 (and only during such fiscal quarter), if the last reported sale price of our common stock for at least trading days (whether or not consecutive) during a period of consecutive trading days ending on, and including, the last trading day of the immediately preceding fiscal quarter is greater than or equal to of the conversion price on each applicable trading day; (ii) during the business day period after any consecutive trading day period (the measurement period in which the trading price (as defined in the Indenture) per 1,000 principal amount of the 2027 Notes for each trading day of the measurement period was less than of the product of the last reported sale price of our common stock and the conversion rate on each such trading day; (iii) if we call any or all of the 2027 Notes for redemption, at any time prior to the close of business on the scheduled trading day immediately preceding the redemption date; or (iv) upon the occurrence of specified corporate events. On or after November 15, 2026 until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the Maturity Date, holders may convert all or any portion of their 2027 Notes at any time, regardless of the foregoing circumstances. Upon conversion, we will pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock, at our election. 
 The conversion rate will initially be 30.8804 shares of our common stock per 1,000 principal amount of the 2027 Notes (equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately per share of our common stock). The conversion rate is subject to adjustment in some events but will not be adjusted for any accrued and unpaid interest. In addition, following certain corporate events that occur prior to the Maturity Date or if we deliver a notice of redemption, we will, in certain circumstances, increase the conversion rate for a holder who elects to convert its 2027 Notes in connection with such a corporate event or notice of redemption, as the case may be. 
 We may redeem for cash all or any portion of the 2027 Notes, at our option, on or after February 20, 2024 if the last reported sale price of our common stock has been at least of the conversion price then in effect for at least trading days (whether or not consecutive) during any consecutive trading day period (including the last trading day of such period) ending on, and including, the trading day immediately preceding the date on which we provide notice of redemption at a redemption price equal to of the principal amount of the 2027 Notes to be redeemed, plus any accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date. The threshold to redeem has not been met as of September 30, 2024. No sinking fund is provided for the 2027 Notes. 
 If we undergo a fundamental change (as defined in the Indenture), holders may require us to repurchase for cash all or any portion of their 2027 Notes at a fundamental change repurchase price equal to of the principal amount of the 2027 Notes to be repurchased, plus any accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date. 
 Capped Call Transactions 
 Concurrently with the 2027 Notes, we entered into capped call transactions with the option counterparties and used million of the net proceeds from the 2027 Notes to pay the cost of the capped call transactions. The capped call transactions are expected generally to reduce the potential dilutive effect upon conversion of the 2027 Notes and/or offset any cash payments we are required to make in excess of the principal amount of converted 2027 Notes, as the case may be, with such reduction and/or offset subject to a price cap of of our common stock per share, which represents a premium of over the last reported sale price of our common stock on February 10, 2020. The cap ped calls have an initial strike price of per share, subject to certain adjustments, which corresponds to the conversion option strike price in the 2027

 million shares of our common stock. 
 The capped call transactions are separate transactions that we entered into with the option counterparties and are not part of the terms of the 2027 Notes. As the capped call transactions meet certain accounting criteria, the premium paid of million was recorded as a reduction in additional paid-in capital in the condensed consolidated balance sheets, and will not be remeasured to fair value as long as the accounting criteria continue to be met. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had not purchased any shares under the capped call transactions. 
 
 Note Purchase Agreement 
 In March 2022, we entered into the Note Purchase Agreement and issued the First Tranche in an aggregate principal amount for all such Notes of million. In August 2023, we entered into the First Amendment to reduce the Second Tranche from million to million, and we subsequently issued million to the Purchasers. Additionally, the First Amendment increased the uncommitted Third Tranche from million to million. The uncommitted Third Tranche was available until March 31, 2024, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions set forth in the Note Purchase Agreement, including the achievement of greater than or equal to million in trailing twelve months revenue for DAXXIFY preceding the date of the draw request for the Third Tranche, and approval by Athyrium, which we did not draw on. 
 Our obligations under the Note Purchase Agreement are secured by substantially all of our assets and the assets of our wholly owned domestic subsidiaries, including their respective intellectual property. 
 The notes issued pursuant to the First Tranche and Second Tranche bear interest at an annual fixed interest rate equal to . We are required to make quarterly interest payments on each Notes Payable commencing on the last business day of the calendar month following the funding date thereof, and continuing until the Maturity Date. Pursuant to the First Amendment, the Company is required to repay Athyrium the outstanding principal amount of the Second Tranche notes in installments on the last business day of each March, June, September and December (commencing in September 2024), in each case, based on the following principal amortization payment schedule: in September and December 2024; in March and June 2025; in September and December 2025; and in March and June 2026; followed by repayment of the Second Tranche in full on September 18, 2026. The Maturity Date may be extended to March 18, 2028 if, as of September 18, 2026, less than million principal amount of our existing 2027 Notes remain outstanding and with the consent of the Purchasers. Initially, all principal for each tranche is due and payable on the Maturity Date. At our option, we may prepay the outstanding principal balance of all or any portion of the principal amount of the Notes Payable, subject to a prepayment fee equal to (i) a make-whole amount if the prepayment occurs on or prior to the first anniversary of the NPA Effective Date and (ii) of the amount prepaid if the prepayment occurs after the first anniversary of the NPA Effective Date but on or prior to the second anniversary of the NPA Effective Date. Upon prepayment or repayment of all or any portion of the principal amount of the Notes Payable (whether on the Maturity Date or otherwise), we are also required to pay an exit fee to the Purchasers. 
 The Note Purchase Agreement includes affirmative and negative covenants applicable to us, our current subsidiaries and any subsidiaries we create in the future. The affirmative covenants include, among others, covenants requiring us to maintain our legal existence and governmental approvals, deliver certain financial reports, maintain insurance coverage and satisfy certain requirements regarding deposit accounts. We must also (i) maintain at least million of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents in accounts subject to a control agreement in favor of Athyrium at all times (the Minimum Cash Covenant) and (ii) upon the occurrence of certain specified events set forth in the Note Purchase Agreement, achieve at least million of Consolidated Teoxane Distribution Net Product Sales on a trailing twelve-months basis. The negative covenants include, among others, restrictions on our transferring collateral, incurring additional indebtedness, engaging in mergers or acquisitions, paying dividends or making other distributions, making investments, creating liens, selling assets and undergoing a change in control, in each case subject to certain exceptions. 
 If we do not comply with the affirmative and negative covenants, such non-compliance may be an event of default under the Note Purchase Agreement. The Note Purchase Agreement also includes events of default, the occurrence and continuation of which could cause interest to be charged at the rate that is otherwise applicable plus and would provide

 Net Loss per Share 
 Our basic net loss per share from continuing operations is calculated by dividing the net loss from continuing operations by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the period. Our basic net loss per share from discontinued operations is calculated by dividing the net loss from discontinued operations by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the period. The diluted net loss per share from both continuing and discontinued operations are calculated by giving effect to all potential dilutive common stock equivalents outstanding for the period. For purposes of this calculation, shares of common stock underlying the 2027 Notes at the initial conversion price, outstanding stock options, unvested stock awards, and shares of common stock expected to be purchased under the 2014 ESPP, are considered common stock equivalents, which were excluded from the computation of diluted net loss per share because including them would have been antidilutive.

The complaint alleges that the Company and certain of its officers violated Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of Exchange Act by making false and misleading statements regarding the manufacturing of DAXXIFY and the timing and likelihood of regulatory approval and seeks unspecified monetary damages on behalf of the putative class and an award of costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys fees. The court appointed the lead plaintiff and lead counsel on September 7, 2022. The lead plaintiff filed an amended complaint on November 7, 2022. On January 23, 2023, we filed a motion to dismiss, and on March 30, 2024, the Court granted the motion with leave for the plaintiff to amend the complaint. On May 1, 2024, the plaintiff filed an amended complaint, which asserted similar claims to those in the prior complaint. On June 25, 2024, the Company filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint. 
 
 We dispute the claims in these lawsuits and intend to defend these matters vigorously. These lawsuits are subject to inherent uncertainties, and the actual defense and disposition costs will depend upon many unknown factors. The outcomes of the lawsuits are necessarily uncertain. We could be forced to expend significant resources in the defense of either lawsuit, and we may not prevail. In addition, we may incur substantial legal fees and costs in connection with each lawsuit.

 Summary of Risk Factors 
 Investing in our common stock involves risks. See Item 1A. Risk Factors in this Report and in our FY2023 Form 10-K for a discussion of the following principal risks and other risks that make an investment in Revance speculative or risky. 
 There are significant risks and uncertainties associated with the pending Offer and Merger, including the risk that the Offer or the Merger may not be completed in a timely manner or at all, or may be completed on modified terms. The 
 29 

Table of Contents 

 Offer has not yet commenced. If the Offer does commence, closing of the Merger will remain subject to certain closing conditions that could adversely affect us or cause the Merger to be abandoned. 
 Management has concluded there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. In order to mitigate the substantial doubt to continue as a going concern, we may be required to refinance our debt, conduct additional financings, restructure operations, sell assets or reduce our operating expenses. We have incurred significant losses since our inception and we anticipate that we will continue to incur operating losses for the foreseeable future and may not achieve or maintain profitability in the future. Our prior losses, combined with expected future losses, may adversely affect the market price of our common stock, our ability to raise capital and our ability to maintain compliance with our debt covenants. 
 Our success as a company, including our ability to finance our business and generate revenue, and our future growth is substantially dependent on the clinical and commercial success of our Products. If we are unable to successfully commercialize our Products, complete the development and regulatory approval process of our product candidates, and maintain regulatory approval of our Products we may not be able to generate sufficient revenue to continue our business. 
 We use third-party collaborators, including Teoxane, Viatris, Fosun, ABPS and PCI to help us develop, validate, manufacture and/or commercialize our products. Our ability to commercialize our products could be impaired or delayed if these collaborations are unsuccessful. 
 
 DAXXIFY and any future product candidates, if approved, may not achieve market acceptance among injectors, HCPs, healthcare organizations and administrators, others in the healthcare community and consumers and patients, and may not be commercially successful, which would adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. 
 
 DAXXIFY , the RHA Collection of dermal fillers and any future product candidates will face significant competition, including from companies that enjoy significant competitive advantages, such as substantially greater financial, research and development, regulatory, manufacturing, marketing resources and expertise, greater brand recognition and more established relationships. Our failure to effectively compete may prevent us from achieving significant market penetration and expansion. 
 If we are not able to effectively and reliably manufacture DAXXIFY or any future product candidates at sufficient scale and appropriate cost, including through any third-party manufacturers, as well as acquire supplies of the RHA Collection of dermal fillers from Teoxane, our product development, regulatory approval, commercialization and sales efforts and our ability to generate revenue may be adversely affected. 
 Servicing our debt, including the 2027 Notes and Notes Payable, requires a significant amount of cash to pay our substantial debt. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as selling assets, restructuring debt or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive. 
 Macroeconomic and geopolitical factors and a public health crisis, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, have and may continue to adversely affect our business, as well as those of third-parties on which we rely for significant manufacturing, clinical or other business operations. They may also impact disposable income levels, which could reduce consumer spending and lower demand for our Products. 
 We are subject to uncertainty relating to pricing and reimbursement. Failure to obtain or maintain adequate coverage, pricing and reimbursement for DAXXIFY for therapeutics uses, or our other future approved products, if any, could have a material adverse impact on our ability to commercialize such products. 
 Reports of adverse events or safety concerns involving our Products could delay or prevent the Company or Teoxane from maintaining regulatory approval for such Products, or obtaining additional regulatory approval for additional indications or future product candidates. The denial, delay or withdrawal of any such approval would 
 30 

Table of Contents 

 negatively impact commercialization and could have a material adverse effect on our ability to generate revenue, business prospects, and results of operations. 
 Unfavorable publicity relating to one or more of our Products, whether related to aesthetic or therapeutic indications, may affect the public perception of our entire portfolio of Products. 
 
 Clinical drug development involves a lengthy and expensive process with an uncertain outcome, and results of earlier studies and trials may not be predictive of future trial results or actual consumer outcomes. 
 If our efforts to protect our intellectual property related to DAXXIFY , the RHA Collection of dermal fillers or any future product candidates are not adequate, we may not be able to compete effectively. Additionally, we are currently and in the future may become involved in lawsuits or administrative proceedings to defend against claims that we infringe the intellectual property of others and to protect or enforce our patents or other intellectual property or the patents of our licensors, which could be expensive and time-consuming and would have a material adverse effect on our ability to generate revenue if we are unsuccessful. 
 We are currently, and in the future may be, subject to securities class action and stockholder derivative actions. If other stockholder derivative actions, additional securities class actions or other lawsuits are brought against us, including product liability actions, and we cannot successfully defend ourselves, we may incur substantial liabilities or be required to limit commercialization of our products. Even a successful defense would require significant financial and management resources. 
 As our business and operations continue to grow, we may need to expand our development, manufacturing, regulatory, sales, marketing and distribution capabilities. If and when we expand such capabilities, we may encounter difficulties in managing our growth, which could disrupt our operations. 
 We have undertaken, and may in the future undertake, restructuring plans to adjust our investment priorities and manage our operating expenses, which plans may not result in the savings or operational efficiencies anticipated and could result in total costs and expenses that are greater than expected. 
 
 If we are not successful in discovering, developing, acquiring and commercializing additional product candidates other than our current Products, our ability to expand our business and achieve our strategic objectives may be impaired. 
 We have experienced and may experience in the future compromises or failures of our information technology systems or data, or those of third-parties upon which we rely, which could adversely affect our business. Despite significant efforts to secure against such threats, it is impossible to entirely mitigate these risks. 
 Changes in and failures to comply with applicable laws, regulations and standards may adversely affect our business, operations and financial performance. 
 If we fail to attract and retain qualified personnel at all levels and functions, we may be unable to successfully execute our objectives.

 Recent Developments 

Pending Merger 
 On August 11, 2024, the Company and the Buyer Parties entered into the Merger Agreement, pursuant to which Crown will cause Merger Sub to commence the Offer as promptly as practicable, but in no event later than fifteen business days after the date of the Merger Agreement or such other date as may be agreed to between the Company and Crown, to purchase all of our outstanding Shares of common stock, par value 0.001 per Share, of the Company at a price of 6.66 per Share, in cash, without interest and less any required tax withholding. As a result of discussions between the Company and Teoxane regarding an alleged breach of the Teoxane Agreement, the Buyer Parties extended the date by which Merger Sub was obligated to commence the tender offer for all of the Shares pursuant to the Merger Agreement. The Company and Crown agreed to extend the Offer commencement date to November 12, 2024. The Merger Agreement contemplates that, as soon as practicable following the consummation of the Offer, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub will be merged with and into the Company, with the Company surviving as a wholly owned subsidiary of Crown. The Offer has not commenced. If the Offer commences, consummation of the Offer and closing of the Merger will remain subject to customary closing conditions, including i) the Minimum Condition; (ii) the absence of any order, injunction or law prohibiting the Offer or the closing of the Merger; (iii) obtaining applicable approvals under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, which approval has already been received; and (iv) the accuracy of the representations and warranties contained in the Merger Agreement, subject to customary materiality qualifications, and compliance with the covenants and agreements contained in the Merger Agreement as of the closing of the Merger. If the Merger is completed, it is expected that our common stock will thereafter be removed from listing on the Nasdaq Global Market and from registration under Section 12(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. 
 
 Both parties have termination rights under certain circumstances. If the Merger Agreement is terminated under certain circumstances, the Company may be required to pay a 28.8 million termination fee to Crown, including if the Company accepts a Superior Proposal. 
 
 The description of the Merger Agreement throughout this Report does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Merger Agreement, which was filed as Exhibit 2.1 to our Current Report on Form 8-K filed on August 12, 2024 and incorporated by reference as Exhibit 2.1 hereto.

 Exit of the Fintech Platform Business 
 In September 2023, we commenced a plan to exit the Fintech Platform business as the costs and resources required to support the Fintech Platform no longer aligned with the Company s capital allocation priorities. The exit and restructuring activities included elimination of Fintech Platform personnel, the termination of Fintech Platform research and development activities and an elimination of outside services expenses related to the Fintech Platform. Based on such plan, substantially all payment processing activities for Fintech Platform customers ended on January 31, 2024 and we substantially completed the activities related to winding down the remaining Fintech Platform operations as of March 31, 2024. Beginning as of March 31, 2024, the Service Segment is presented as a discontinued operation in our condensed consolidated financial statements with certain prior period amounts retrospectively revised to reflect this change. Although we discontinued the Service Segment, we do not expect the discontinuation of the Service Segment to have a material effect on our liquidity going forward. See Part I, Item 1, Financial Information Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) Note 3 Exit of the Fintech Platform Business in this Report for additional information. 
 
 Results of Operations 
 In connection with the completion of the exit of the Fintech Platform business discussed above, the results of our Fintech Platform business have been reflected as discontinued operations in our condensed consolidated financial statements as of and for the period ended September 30, 2024. Certain prior year figures were reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. Additionally, we began operating under a single reportable segment as of March 31, 2024. See Part I, Item 1, Financial Information Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) Note 3 Exit of the Fintech Platform Business in this Report for additional information. Accordingly, the results of operations discussed below no longer include a discussion of the Service Segment and the effect of the Service Segment on prior period amounts have been retrospectively revised for comparative purposes to more accurately reflect the period over period changes in our continuing operations. 
 
 Revenue 
 We generate product revenue from the sale of our Products. We generate collaboration revenue from an onabotulinumtoxinA biosimilar program with Viatris as well as the collaboration with Fosun for the development and commercialization of DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection. The service revenue generated from the Fintech Platform is classified as discontinued operations as discussed in Part I, Item 1. Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) Note 3 Exit of the Fintech Platform Business .

 Product Revenue 
 Our breakdown of revenue by Product is summarized below: 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, (in thousands, except percentages) 2024 2023 Change Change 2024 2023 Change Change Product: RHA Collection of dermal fillers

 58,827 54,109 4,718 9 175,874 154,160 21,714 14 
 For both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, our net total product revenue increased compared to the same periods in 2023 primarily due to an increase in sales volume across both product lines, and partially offset by an overall reduction in average selling prices for both product lines. 
 
 Collaboration Revenue 
 We are actively developing an onabotulinumtoxinA biosimilar in collaboration with Viatris. As described in Part I, Item 1. Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) Note 4 Revenue, we generally recognize collaboration revenue for the onabotulinumtoxinA biosimilar program based on the determined transactions price of the contract multiplied by the quotient of the cost of development services incurred over the total estimated cost of development services for the expected duration of our performance obligations. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized revenue related to development services under the Viatris Agreement of 1.0 million and 1.3 million, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recognized no revenue related to development services under the Viatris Agreement. 
 We are also working with Fosun to develop and commercialize DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection in the Fosun Territory under the Fosun License Agreement. As described in Part I, Item 1. Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) Note 4 Revenue, we evaluated all of the variable payments to be received during the duration of the contract, which included payments from specified milestones, royalties, and estimated supplies to be delivered. Upon China s NMPA approval of DAXXIFY for the improvement of glabellar lines in September 2024, Fosun was obligated to pay us a milestone payment of 13.5 million, net of 1.5 million foreign withholding taxes, which we received in October 2024. The milestone payment was included as Deferred revenue on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, no collaboration revenue is recognized from the Fosun License Agreement. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, revenue of less than 0.1 million and 0.1 million, respectively, was recognized from the Fosun License Agreement, respectively.

 Cost of product revenue (exclusive of amortization) is generally incurred when our Products are delivered and primarily consists of the purchasing cost of the RHA Collection of dermal fillers and manufacturing costs of DAXXIFY and distribution expenses, royalty, other fulfillment costs related to the RHA Collection of dermal fillers and DAXXIFY . Substantially all of DAXXIFY manufacturing expenses incurred prior to DAXXIFY GL Approval were classified as research and development expenses, resulting in Zero-cost Inventory. 
 Our cost of product revenue (exclusive of amortization) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased compared to the same periods in 2023, primarily due to higher sales volume of our Products. When Zero-cost Inventory, which is further discussed below, is depleted, we expect our cost of product revenue (exclusive of amortization) associated with DAXXIFY to increase. We also anticipate that our cost of product revenue (exclusive of amortization) associated with the RHA Collection of dermal fillers to increase as sales volume increases. 
 Purchasing and manufacturing costs 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, purchasing and manufacturing costs increased compared to the same periods in 2023, primarily due to the higher sales volume of our Products. 
 Distribution, royalty and other fulfillment charges 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, distribution, royalty, and other fulfillment costs increased compared to the same periods in 2023, primarily due to higher sales volume of our Products.

 Impact of Zero-cost Inventory for DAXXIFY 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the cost of product revenue (exclusive of amortization) would have increased by approximately 5 million and 18 million, respectively, if cost of product revenue (exclusive of amortization) included previously expensed inventories. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the cost of product revenue (exclusive of amortization) would have increased by approximately 3 million and 11 million, respectively, if cost of product revenue (exclusive of amortization) included previously expensed inventories. We expect to utilize existing Zero-cost Inventory until depleted in the near-term. Once depleted, we expect our cost of product revenue (exclusive of amortization) associated with DAXXIFY to increase.

 Selling, general and administrative expenses (before stock-based compensation and depreciation and amortization) consist primarily of the following: 
 Costs of sales and marketing activities and sales force compensation related to our Products; and 
 Personnel and professional service costs in our finance, information technology, investor relations, legal, human resources, and other administrative departments; 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to the implementation of cost efficiency measures during the current year, partially offset by increased sales and marketing expense for therapeutics, increased legal costs, and transaction costs related to the pending Merger. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, selling, general and administrative expenses increased compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to 7.3 million of transaction costs related to the pending Merger, an increase in sales and marketing activities in preparation for our DAXXIFY therapeutics launch, and certain litigation matters, partially offset by cost efficiency measures realized during the period.

 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, stock-based compensation included in selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 5.1 million and 15.4 million, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023, primarily due to the (i) stock-based compensation expense recognized for the vesting of the DAXXIFY GL Approval PSU in March 2023, (ii) the impact of the exit of the Fintech Platform business, (iii) the stock-based compensation expense recognized for the vesting of certain market-based PSUs in May 2023, and (iv) lower grant-date fair value of stock awards granted in 2024 compared to 2023, partially offset by expenses associated with certain equity award modifications in selling, general and administrative functions.

 Research and development expenses (before stock-based compensation and depreciation and amortization) 
 We generally do not allocate costs by product candidates unless contractually required by our business partners. Research and development expenses (before stock-based compensation and depreciation and amortization) consist primarily of: 
 Personnel costs in our research and development functions; 
 expenses related to the initiation and completion of clinical trials and studies for the RHA Pipeline Products and an onabotulinumtoxinA biosimilar, including expenses related to the production of clinical supplies; 
 expenses related to the manufacturing of supplies for clinical activities, regulatory approvals, and pre-commercial inventory; 
 certain expenses related to the establishment and maintenance of our manufacturing facilities; 
 expenses related to medical affairs, medical information, publications and pharmacovigilance oversight; 
 expenses related to license fees, milestone payments, and development efforts under in-licensing agreements; 
 expenses related to compliance with drug development regulatory requirements in the U.S. and other foreign jurisdictions; 
 fees paid to clinical consultants, CROs and other vendors, including all related fees for investigator grants, patient screening fees, laboratory work and statistical compilation and analysis; and 
 other consulting fees paid to third-parties;

 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, research and development expenses (before stock-based compensation and depreciation and amortization) decreased compared to the same periods in 2023, primarily due to the FDA approval of our PAS submission for the ABPS manufacturing facility in late March 2023 which allowed manufacturing related expenses for DAXXIFY to be capitalized on the condensed consolidated balance sheet. Prior to the approval, such manufacturing related expenses were classified as research and development expense in the condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. 
 Our research and development expenses (before stock-based compensation and depreciation and amortization) are subject to numerous uncertainties, primarily related to the timing and cost needed to complete our respective projects. The development timelines, probability of success and development expenses can differ materially from expectations, and the completion of clinical trials may take several years or more depending on the type, complexity, novelty and intended use of a product candidate. Accordingly, the cost of clinical trials may vary significantly over the life of a project as a result of differences arising during clinical development. We expect our research and development expenses (before stock-based compensation and depreciation and amortization) to be relatively consistent in the near term, primarily due to deferring the Phase 3 clinical program for upper limb spasticity and other therapeutics pipeline activities. However, we will continue sharing certain development costs with Teoxane related to the RHA Pipeline Products, and other activities related to the pursuit of approval for the PCI manufacturing facility. 
 When we conduct additional clinical trials, such as for our biosimilar program or additional DAXXIFY therapeutic indications, we expect our research and development expenses (before stock-based compensation and depreciation and amortization) to increase. Depending on the stage of completion and level of effort related to each development phase undertaken, we may reflect variations in our research and development expenses. We expense both internal and external research and development expenses as they are incurred. 
 Stock-based compensation 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, stock-based compensation included in research and development expenses decreased compared to the same periods in 2023, primarily due to the (i) stock-based compensation expense recognized from the vesting of the DAXXIFY GL Approval PSU in March 2023, (ii) impact of the exit of the Fintech Platform business, (iii) the stock-based compensation expense recognized for the vesting of certain market-based PSUs in May 2023; and (iv) lower grant-date fair value from stock awards granted in 2024 in comparison to 2023, offset by lower capitalized stock-based compensation in 2024. 
 
 Amortization 
 Amortization presented separately on the condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss represents the amortization for the distribution rights, which is within the functional area of cost of product revenue. Refer to Part I, Item 1. Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) Note 3 Exit of the Fintech Platform Business for the amortization expense classified as discontinued operations.

 Net Non-Operating Income and Expense

 Interest Income 
 Interest income primarily consists of interest income earned on our deposit, money market fund, and investment balances. We expect interest income to vary each reporting period depending on our average deposit, money market fund, and investment balances during the period and market interest rates. 
 Interest Expense 
 Interest expense includes cash and non-cash components. The cash component of the interest expense primarily consists of the contractual interest charges for our 2027 Notes and Notes Payable, as well as our finance lease liability interest expense. The non-cash component of the interest expense primarily consists of the amortization of debt issuance costs for our 2027 Notes and the amortization of debt insurance cost, debt discount, and exit fee for the Notes Payable. 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, interest expense increased compared to the same periods in 2023 due to interest associated with the issuance of the Second Tranche of the Notes payable in August 2023, and partially offset by a decrease in interest expense for our finance lease liability. 
 Other Expense, net 
 Other expense, net primarily consists of miscellaneous tax and other expense items partially offset by office lease sublease income. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Our financial condition is summarized as follows: 
 (in thousands) September 30, December 31, 2023 Increase/(Decrease) 
 Cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments 184,076 253,915 (69,839) Working capital 249,638 249,641 (3) Stockholders deficit (163,030) (151,604) 11,426 
 
 Sources and Uses of Cash 
 We hold our cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments in bank accounts and interest-bearing instruments subject to investment guidelines for high credit quality. Our investment portfolio is structured to provide for investment maturities and access to cash to fund our anticipated working capital needs. 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of 184.1 million and 253.9 million, respectively, which reflected a decrease between these periods of 69.8 million. The decrease was primarily due to cash used in operating activities of 148.2 million, principal payments on a finance lease of 12.6 million, finance lease prepayment of 9.1 million, purchases of property and equipment of 2.2 million, and payment 
 40 

Table of Contents 

 of debt principal and an exit fee of 1.3 million. The decrease was primarily offset by proceeds from a follow-on public offering, net of underwriting discount of 97.6 million and other cash inflows of 6.0 million. 
 
 We derived the following summary of our condensed consolidated cash flows for the periods indicated from Part I, Item 1, Financial Information Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) in this Report: 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, (in thousands) 2024 2023 Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities (148,157) (173,844) Investing activities (15,305) 107,370 Financing activities 83,327 138,196 
 Cash Flows from Operating Activities 
 Our cash used in operating activities is primarily driven by personnel costs, manufacturing and facility costs, sales and marketing activities, and general and administrative support, offset by revenue generated from the sale of our Products. Our cash flows from operating activities will continue to be affected principally by the revenue generated from our Products and our working capital requirements, with a primary focus on commercial operations. 
 Cash used in operating activities for nine months ended September 30, 2024 consisted of approximately 314 million in expenditures related to overall operations, partially offset by approximately 166 million in cash receipts from our revenue. The increase in net cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 2023 is primarily driven by expenditures related to supporting the Company s commercial growth, and partially offset by an increase in cash receipt from Product sales. 
 Cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 consisted of approximately 326 million in expenditures related to overall operations, partially offset by approximately 152 million in cash receipts from our revenue. 
 Cash Flows from Investing Activities 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, net cash provided by or used in investing activities was primarily due to fluctuations in the timing of purchases and maturities of investments, prepayment on a finance lease, and purchases of property and equipment. 
 Cash Flows from Financing Activities 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash provided by financing activities was driven by proceeds from follow-on public offering, net of underwriting discount, and proceeds from the exercise of stock options and employee stock purchase plan, which was offset by the principal payments on finance lease obligations, payment of debt principal and exit fee, net settlement of stock awards for employee taxes, and payments of offering costs. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, net cash provided by financing activities was driven by the proceeds from the ATM, net of commissions, the issuance of the Notes Payable pursuant to the Note Purchase Agreement, net of debt discount and the exercise of stock options and purchases of our common stock through the 2014 ESPP. The inflows were offset by the net settlement of stock awards for employee taxes, and principal payments on finance lease obligations. 

Convertible Senior Notes 
 In February 2020, we issued the 2027 Notes, in the aggregate principal amount of 287.5 million, pursuant to the Indenture. The 2027 Notes are senior unsecured obligations and bear interest at a rate of 1.75 per year, payable semiannually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year, began on August 15, 2020. The 2027 Notes will mature 
 41 

Table of Contents 

 on February 15, 2027, unless earlier converted, redeemed or repurchased. In connection with issuing the 2027 Notes, we received 278.3 million in net proceeds, after deducting the initial purchasers discount, commissions, and other issuance costs. 
 The 2027 Notes may be converted at any time by the holders prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding November 15, 2026 only under the following circumstances: (i) during any fiscal quarter commencing after the fiscal quarter ending on June 30, 2020 (and only during such fiscal quarter), if the last reported sale price of our common stock for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on, and including, the last trading day of the immediately preceding fiscal quarter is greater than or equal to 130 of the conversion price on each applicable trading day; (ii) during the measurement period in which the trading price (as defined in the Indenture) per 1,000 principal amount of the 2027 Notes for each trading day of the measurement period was less than 98 of the product of the last reported sale price of our common stock and the conversion rate on each such trading day; (iii) if we call any or all of the 2027 Notes for redemption, at any time prior to the close of business on the scheduled trading day immediately preceding the redemption date; or (iv) upon the occurrence of specified corporate events. On or after November 15, 2026 until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the Maturity Date, holders may convert all or any portion of their 2027 Notes at any time, regardless of the foregoing circumstances. Upon conversion, we will pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock, at our election. 
 The conversion rate will initially be 30.8804 shares of our common stock per 1,000 principal amount of the 2027 Notes (equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately 32.38 per share of our common stock). The conversion rate is subject to adjustment in some events but will not be adjusted for any accrued and unpaid interest. In addition, following certain corporate events that occur prior to the Maturity Date or if we deliver a notice of redemption, we will, in certain circumstances, increase the conversion rate for a holder who elects to convert its 2027 Notes in connection with such a corporate event or notice of redemption, as the case may be. 
 We may redeem for cash all or any portion of the 2027 Notes, at our option, on or after February 20, 2024 if the last reported sale price of our common stock has been at least 130 of the conversion price then in effect for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during any 30 consecutive trading day period (including the last trading day of such period) ending on, and including, the trading day immediately preceding the date on which we provide notice of redemption at a redemption price equal to 100 of the principal amount of the 2027 Notes to be redeemed, plus any accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date. The threshold to redeem has not been met as of September 30, 2024. No sinking fund is provided for the 2027 Notes. 
 If we undergo a fundamental change (as defined in the Indenture), holders may require us to repurchase for cash all or any portion of their 2027 Notes at a fundamental change repurchase price equal to 100 of the principal amount of the 2027 Notes to be repurchased, plus any accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date. 
 Within the time periods required by the terms of the Indenture, we have agreed to deliver any notices (including with respect to holders rights to require repurchase or conversion of the convertible notes), certificates, supplemental indentures and other documents that might be required under the convertible notes indenture and take all other actions that are required under the terms of the 2027 Notes, the Indenture or under applicable law, including as a result of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, to the extent constituting a Fundamental Change or Make-Whole Fundamental Change (as such terms are defined in the Indenture). 
 We used 28.9 million of the net proceeds from the 2027 Notes to pay the cost of the capped call transactions. The capped call transactions are expected generally to reduce the potential dilutive effect upon conversion of the 2027 Notes and/or offset any cash payments we are required to make in excess of the principal amount of converted 2027 Notes, as the case may be, with such reduction and/or offset subject to a price cap of 48.88 of our common stock per share, which represents a premium of 100 over the last reported sale price of our common stock on February 10, 2020. The capped calls have an initial strike price of 32.38 per share, subject to certain adjustments, which corresponds to the conversion option strike price in the 2027 Notes. The capped call transactions cover, subject to anti-dilution adjustments, approximately 8.9 million shares of our common stock.

Note Purchase Agreement 
 In March 2022, we entered into the Note Purchase Agreement and issued the First Tranche in an aggregate principal amount for all such Notes of 100 million. In August 2023, we entered into the First Amendment to reduce the Second Tranche from 100 million to 50 million, and we subsequently issued 50 million to the Purchasers. Additionally, the First Amendment increased the uncommitted Third Tranche from 100 million to 150 million. The uncommitted Third Tranche was available until March 31, 2024, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions set forth in the Note Purchase Agreement, including the achievement of greater than or equal to 50 million in trailing twelve months revenue for DAXXIFY preceding the date of the draw request for the Third Tranche, and approval by Athyrium, which we did not draw on. 
 Our obligations under the Note Purchase Agreement are secured by substantially all of our assets and the assets of our wholly owned domestic subsidiaries, including their respective intellectual property. 
 The notes issued pursuant to the First Tranche and Second Tranche bear interest at an annual fixed interest rate equal to 8.50 . We are required to make quarterly interest payments on each Notes Payable commencing on the last business day of the calendar month following the funding date thereof, and continuing until the Maturity Date. Pursuant to the First Amendment, the Company is required to repay Athyrium the outstanding principal amount of the Second Tranche notes in installments on the last business day of each March, June, September and December (commencing in September 2024), in each case, based on the following principal amortization payment schedule: 2.5 in September and December 2024; 5.0 in March and June 2025; 7.5 in September and December 2025; and 10.0 in March and June 2026; followed by repayment of the Second Tranche in full on September 18, 2026. The Maturity Date may be extended to March 18, 2028 if, as of September 18, 2026, less than 90 million principal amount of our existing 2027 Notes remain outstanding and with the consent of the Purchasers. Initially, all principal for each tranche is due and payable on the Maturity Date. At our option, we may prepay the outstanding principal balance of all or any portion of the principal amount of the Notes Payable, subject to a prepayment fee equal to (i) a make-whole amount if the prepayment occurs on or prior to the first anniversary of the NPA Effective Date and (ii) 2.0 of the amount prepaid if the prepayment occurs after the first anniversary of the NPA Effective Date but on or prior to the second anniversary of the NPA Effective Date. Upon prepayment or repayment of all or any portion of the principal amount of the Notes Payable (whether on the Maturity Date or otherwise), we are also required to pay an exit fee to the Purchasers. 
 The Note Purchase Agreement includes affirmative and negative covenants applicable to us, our current subsidiaries and any subsidiaries we create in the future. The affirmative covenants include, among others, covenants requiring us to maintain our legal existence and governmental approvals, deliver certain financial reports, maintain insurance coverage and satisfy certain requirements regarding deposit accounts. We must also (i) maintain at least 30.0 million of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents in accounts subject to a control agreement in favor of Athyrium at all times (the Minimum Cash Covenant) and (ii) upon the occurrence of certain specified events set forth in the Note Purchase Agreement, achieve at least 70.0 million of Consolidated Teoxane Distribution Net Product Sales on a trailing twelve-months basis. The negative covenants include, among others, restrictions on our transferring collateral, incurring additional indebtedness, engaging in mergers or acquisitions, paying dividends or making other distributions, making investments, creating liens, selling assets and undergoing a change in control, in each case subject to certain exceptions. 
 If we do not comply with the affirmative and negative covenants, such non-compliance may be an event of default under the Note Purchase Agreement. The Note Purchase Agreement also includes events of default, the occurrence and continuation of which could cause interest to be charged at the rate that is otherwise applicable plus 2.0 and would provide Athyrium, as administrative agent, with the right to exercise remedies against us and the collateral, including foreclosure against our property securing the obligations under the Note Purchase Agreement, including our cash. These events of default include, among other things, our failure to pay principal or interest due under the Note Purchase Agreement, a breach of certain covenants under the Note Purchase Agreement, our insolvency, the occurrence of a circumstance which could have a material adverse effect and the occurrence of any default under certain other indebtedness.

 Follow-On Offering 
 In March 2024, we completed a follow-on offering, pursuant to which we issued 16.0 million shares of common stock at a price to the public of 6.25 per share (except with respect to 30,000 shares to be sold and issued to Mark Foley, our president, chief executive officer, and director, at 6.98 per share), for net proceeds of 97.1 million, after underwriting discounts and offering costs. 

ATM Offering Program 
 In 2023, we sold 3.2 million shares of common stock under the 2022 ATM Agreement at a weighted average price of 31.90 per share, resulting in net proceeds of 100.0 million after sales agent commissions and offering costs. No shares of common stock were sold during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 from the 2022 ATM Agreement. 
 
 Common Stock and Common Stock Equivalents 
 As of October 31, 2024, outstanding shares of common stock were 104.9 million, unvested RSUs and PSUs were 5.1 million, outstanding stock options were 3.5 million, unvested RSAs and PSAs were 0.6 million, shares expected to be purchased under the 2014 ESPP were 0.1 million and shares of common stock underlying the 2027 Notes was 8.9 million, based upon the initial conversion price. 
 
 Operating and Capital Expenditure Requirements - Going Concern 
 We expect to continue to incur operating losses for the foreseeable future as we continue to devote resources to the commercialization, research and development, manufacturing development and regulatory approval of our products. However, there are numerous risks and uncertainties regarding our planned activities, and as a result our funding requirements. 
 
 Disciplined capital allocation continues to be a priority; however, we have spent and expect to continue to spend significant resources towards the costs of completing the pending Merger, including legal and financial advisory fees and other transaction costs, certain of which are payable by the Company whether or not the Merger is completed. Also, in addition to quarterly interest payments and exit fees, beginning in September 2024, the Company started repaying to Athyrium the outstanding principal amount of the Second Tranche Notes, based on the following principal amortization payment schedule: 2.5 in September and December 2024; 5.0 in March and June 2025; 7.5 in September and December 2025; and 10.0 in March and June 2026. 
 
 In addition, we expect that we will continue to expend substantial resources for the foreseeable future and in the long-term to support the growth of the aesthetics portfolio of Products and DAXXIFY for the treatment of cervical dystonia and to support our ongoing operations. In particular, we anticipate that we will continue to invest substantial resources in our commercialization efforts and the manufacturing and supply of DAXXIFY for commercialization. In addition, in connection with the Teoxane Agreement, we must continue to make specified annual minimum purchases of the RHA Collection of dermal fillers, which amounts have increased following our entry into the Sixth Amendment (see Note 13 for additional information), and meet annual minimum investments in connection with the commercialization of the RHA Collection of dermal fillers. In addition, we have dedicated manufacturing capacity, buyback obligations, cost sharing arrangements and related minimum purchase obligations under our manufacturing and supply agreements in connection with the manufacture and supply of DAXXIFY and any product candidate. We also anticipate expending resources to continue to support the onabotulinumtoxinA biosimilar and Fosun partnerships. In the long term, in addition to the aforementioned expenditures, we anticipate our expenditures will include clinical programs for DAXXIFY in other potential indications and international regulatory investments. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had capital resources of 184.1 million consisting of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments. To date, we have funded our operations primarily through the sale of common stock, convertible senior notes, sales of Products, proceeds from notes issued pursuant to the Note Purchase Agreement and payments received from collaboration arrangements. We also have remaining capacity to sell up to 47.2 million of our common stock under the 2022 ATM Agreement as of September 30, 2024. Our forecasted liquidity is based on our current operating plan and

 excludes any impact from the pending consummation of the Merger. Based on that plan and excluding any impact of the pending consummation of the Merger, our existing cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments will not allow us to fund our operations for at least 12 months following the filing of this Report. Also, we are required to maintain compliance with the Minimum Cash Covenant in accordance with the terms of the Note Purchase Agreement (see Note 10 ). As a result, management has concluded that there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. In order to mitigate the substantial doubt to continue as a going concern, we may be required to refinance our debt, conduct additional financings, restructure operations, sell assets or reduce our operating expenses. If we are unable to generate sufficient revenue to fulfill our operating plan, secure additional capital when needed or sufficiently reduce our operating expenses, we may be unable to comply with the Minimum Cash Covenant or continue to operate our business. 
 
 See Part II. Item 1A. Risk Factors Management has concluded there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern" in this Report and Part I. Item 1A.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 We are exposed to market risk in the ordinary course of our business. Market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates. Our market risk exposure is primarily a result of fluctuations in interest rates. We do not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our exposure to market risk did not change materially from what was disclosed in Item 7A in our FY2023 Form 10-K.

 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Report. The term disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives, and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Report, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in management s evaluation pursuant to Rules 13a-15(d) or 15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
 We are currently involved in litigation relating to claims arising out of our operations and may be involved in such litigation in the future. Such matters are subject to uncertainty and there can be no assurance that such legal proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial position or cash flows. 
 In October 2021, Allergan filed a complaint against us and ABPS, one of our manufacturing sources of DAXXIFY , in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware, alleging infringement of the following patents assigned and/or licensed to Allergan: U.S. Patent Nos. 11,033,625; 7,354,740; 8,409,828; 11,124,786; and 7,332,567. Allergan claims that our formulation for DAXXIFY and ABPS s manufacturing process used to produce DAXXIFY infringes its patents. Allergan also asserted a patent with claims related to a substrate for use in a botulinum toxin detection assay. On November 3, 2021, we filed a motion to dismiss. On November 24, 2021, Allergan filed an amended complaint against us and ABPS, alleging infringement of an additional patent assigned and/or licensed to Allergan: U.S. Patent No. 11,147,878. On December 17, 2021, we filed a second motion to dismiss, and on January 14, 2022, Allergan filed an opposition to that motion. We filed a reply to Allergan s opposition on January 21, 2022, and on August 19, 2022, the court denied our second motion to dismiss. On September 2, 2022, we filed an answer and counterclaims to Allergan's amended complaint. On December 30, 2022, Allergan filed a second amended complaint against us and ABPS, alleging infringement of three additional patents assigned and/or licensed to Allergan: U.S. Patent Nos. 11,203,748; 11,326,155; and 11,285,216. On January 20, 2023, we filed an answer and counterclaims to Allergan's second amended complaint. On March 3, 2023, we filed invalidity contentions, which challenge Allergan s asserted patents. A Markman hearing was held on June 28, 2023, and a decision was issued on August 29, 2023. On September 15, 2023, U.S. Patent No. 7,332,567 was dismissed from the case with prejudice. Allergan reduced the asserted claims to claim 8 of U.S. Patent No. 7,354,740, claims 5 and 8 of U.S. Patent No. 11,203,748, claim 10 of U.S. Patent No. 11,033,625, claims 1, 4, 6, and 20 of U.S. Patent No. 11,147,878, and claim 1 of U.S. Patent No. 11,285,216 via a Stipulation and Order dated June 21, 2024. The jury trial is scheduled to begin in December 2024. 
 
 On December 10, 2021, a putative securities class action complaint was filed against the Company and certain of its officers on behalf of a class of stockholders who acquired the Company s securities from November 25, 2019 to October 11, 2021, in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. The complaint alleges that the Company and certain of its officers violated Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of Exchange Act by making false and misleading statements regarding the manufacturing of DAXXIFY and the timing and likelihood of regulatory approval and seeks unspecified monetary damages on behalf of the putative class and an award of costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys fees. The court appointed the lead plaintiff and lead counsel on September 7, 2022. The lead plaintiff filed an amended complaint on November 7, 2022. On January 23, 2023, we filed a motion to dismiss, and on March 30, 2024, the Court granted the motion with leave for the plaintiff to amend the complaint. On May 1, 2024, the plaintiff filed an amended complaint, which asserted similar claims to those in the prior complaint. On June 25, 2024, the Company filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint. 
 
 We dispute the claims in these lawsuits and intend to defend these matters vigorously. These lawsuits are subject to inherent uncertainties, and the actual defense and disposition costs will depend upon many unknown factors. The outcomes of the lawsuits are necessarily uncertain. We could be forced to expend significant resources in the defense of either lawsuit, and we may not prevail. In addition, we may incur substantial legal fees and costs in connection with each lawsuit. 

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 
 Investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks described below, as well as all other information included in this Report, including our consolidated financial statements, the notes thereto and the section entitled Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, and Part I, Item IA of our FY2023 10-K before you decide to purchase shares of our common stock. If any of those risks actually occurs, our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results could be materially harmed. As a result, the trading price of our common stock could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations and stock price.

 Below we are providing, in supplemental form, new risk factors as well as material changes to our risk factors from those previously disclosed in Part I, Item 1A in our FY2023 10-K. Our risk factors disclosed in Part I, Item 1A of the FY2023 10-K provide additional discussion about these supplemental risks. 
 There are uncertainties as to the timing of the Offer and the Merger, including the risk that the Offer or the Merger may not be completed in a timely manner or at all, or may be completed on modified terms that are less favorable. 
 
 On August 11, 2024, we entered into the Merger Agreement with Crown and Merger Sub, pursuant to which Crown will cause Merger Sub to commence a tender offer as promptly as practicable for all of our outstanding common stock. The commencement date for the tender offer was extended via mutual waiver to November 12, 2024, or such other date as may be mutually agreed to among the Buyer Parties and the Company. There can be no assurance that the Offer and the Merger will be completed in the currently contemplated timeframe, or at all, or on the same terms as originally contemplated by the parties, including at the original Offer Price. While the parties previously contemplated closing the Offer and the Merger during the fourth quarter of 2024, there can be no assurance that all closing conditions will be satisfied (or waived, if applicable) by year-end. The obligation of Merger Sub to accept for payment Shares validly tendered pursuant to the Offer is subject to customary closing conditions, including: (i) the Minimum Condition; (ii) the absence of any order, injunction or law prohibiting the Offer or the closing of the Merger; (iii) obtaining applicable approvals under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, which approval has already been received; and (iv) the accuracy of the representations and warranties contained in the Merger Agreement, subject to customary materiality qualifications, and compliance with the covenants and agreements contained in the Merger Agreement as of the closing of the Merger. 
 The Merger Agreement contains certain termination rights for both the Company and Crown, which could prevent the consummation of the Offer and the Merger. Due to the ongoing discussions between the Company and Crown, in light of the Company s entry into the Teoxane Agreements, the Buyer Parties agreed to further extend the date by which Merger Sub is obligated to commence the tender offer to November 12, 2024 or such other date as may be mutually agreed to between the Company and the Buyer Parties. Crown has expressed dissatisfaction with our entry into the Teoxane Agreements and the terms of such agreements. While the parties continue their discussions, Crown may assert claims related to the Merger Agreement or take other action in connection with the Company s entry into the Teoxane Agreements, including by seeking to unilaterally terminate the Merger Agreement or to otherwise reach a settlement. For these and other reasons, termination of the Merger Agreement could materially and adversely affect our business operations and financial condition, which in turn would materially and adversely affect the price of our common stock. There could also be further delays to the commencement or consummation of the Offer, or in the Company or the Buyer Parties seeking remedies in accordance with, and modifications to, the terms of the Merger Agreement, including Offer Price. 
 
 If the Offer and the Merger are not completed within the expected timeframe or at all, or on modified terms, we will be subject to a number of material risks that could adversely impact our business, financial conditions and results of operations, including the following: 
 the trading price of our Shares may significantly decline to the extent that the market price of the Shares reflect positive market assumptions that the Offer and the Merger will be completed at the current Offer Price, and the related benefits will be realized; 
 if the Merger Agreement is terminated under certain specified circumstances, including by Revance to accept a Superior Proposal, we may be required to pay Crown a termination fee of 28.8 million; 
 the obligation to pay significant transaction costs, such as legal, accounting and financial advisory costs that are not contingent on closing of the Offer and the Merger; 
 the diversion of management s attention from our ongoing business operations towards the Offer and the Merger, for which we will have received little or no benefit if completion of the Offer and the Merger does not occur; 
 negative reactions from employees, resulting in low productivity, employees leaving the Company or possible layoffs; and 
 48 

Table of Contents 

 reputational harm including to relationships with customers, service providers, investors, lenders and business partners due to the adverse perception of any failure to successfully complete the Offer and the Merger. 
 Failure to timely complete the Offer and the Merger could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations and the trading price of our Shares could significantly decline. 
 The announcement and pendency of the Offer and the Merger has resulted and may continue to result in disruptions to our business, divert management s attention and/or disrupt our relationships with third parties and employees, any of which could negatively impact our operating results and ongoing business. 
 
 The Merger Agreement generally requires us to conduct our business in the ordinary course, subject to certain exceptions, including as required by applicable law, pending consummation of the Merger, and subjects us to interim operating covenants that restrict us, without Crown s approval from taking certain specified actions until the Offer and Merger are consummated or the Merger Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms. These restrictions could prevent us from pursuing certain business opportunities that may arise prior to the consummation of the Offer and the Merger and may affect our ability to execute our business strategies and attain financial and other goals and may impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 Our current and prospective employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles with us following the consummation of the Merger, which may materially adversely affect our ability to retain and hire key personnel and other employees while the Offer and Merger are pending. The pending Offer and Merger could cause disruptions to our business or business relationships with our existing and potential customers, service providers, investors, lenders and others with whom we do business, and this could have an adverse impact on our operating results and business generally. Parties with which we have business relationships may experience uncertainty as to the future of such relationships and may delay or defer certain business decisions, seek alternative relationships with third parties, or seek to negotiate changes or alter their present business relationships with us. Parties with whom we otherwise may have sought to establish business relationships may seek alternative relationships with third parties. 
 The pursuit of the Offer and Merger has placed and may continue to place a significant burden on management and internal resources, which may have a negative impact on our ongoing business operations. It has also diverted management s time and attention from the day-to-day operation of our businesses and the execution of our other strategic initiatives. This could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, despite management's efforts to continue to operate in the ordinary course. 
 The adverse consequence of the pendency of the Merger could be exacerbated by any delays in completion of the Merger or termination of the Merger Agreement. In addition, we have incurred, and will continue to incur, significant costs, expenses and fees for professional services and other transaction costs in connection with the Merger, for which we will have received little or no benefit if the Merger is not completed. Many of these fees and costs will be payable by us even if the Merger is not completed and may relate to activities that we would not have undertaken other than to complete the Merger, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 Stockholder litigation in connection with the Offer and Merger may result in significant costs of defense, indemnification and liability, and could impact the timing of or our ability to complete the Merger. 
 
 The Company may be subject to stockholder lawsuits challenging the Offer and Merger. No assurance can be made as to the outcome of these and other similar lawsuits, including the amount of costs associated with defending such claims or any other liabilities that may be incurred in connection with the litigation of such claims. If plaintiffs are successful in obtaining an injunction prohibiting completion of the Offer and Merger on the agreed-upon terms, such an injunction may delay the completion of the Offer and Merger in the expected timeframe or may prevent the Offer and Merger from being completed altogether. Whether or not any plaintiff s claim is successful, such litigation may result in significant costs of defense, indemnification and liability, and diverts management s attention and resources, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

 In certain instances, the Merger Agreement requires us to pay a termination fee to Crown, which could require us to use available cash that would have otherwise been available for general corporate purposes. 
 
 Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, we may be required to pay Crown a termination fee of 28.8 million if the Merger Agreement is terminated under certain circumstances described in the Merger Agreement, including by Revance to accept a Superior Proposal. If the Merger Agreement is terminated under such circumstances, the termination fee we may be required to pay under the Merger Agreement may require us to use available cash that would have otherwise been available for general corporate purposes and other uses. For these and other reasons, termination of the Merger Agreement could materially and adversely affect our business operations and financial condition, which in turn would materially and adversely affect the price of our common stock. 
 The Merger Agreement contains provisions that could discourage a potential competing acquirer of the Company or could result in a competing acquisition proposal being at a lower price than it might otherwise be. 
 
 The Merger Agreement contains provisions that, subject to certain exceptions, restrict our ability to solicit or negotiate any alternative acquisition proposal. For example, the Merger Agreement contains certain termination rights for both the Company and Crown. Either party may terminate for the following events: (i) issuance of a final and non-appealable order by a court of competent jurisdiction that prevents or makes illegal the Offer or the Merger; and (ii) the termination or expiration of the Offer with Merger Sub being required to accept Shares for payment and the failure of the Merger to close by the Outside Date (as defined in the Merger Agreement). The Company may terminate, (i) if Crown fails to commence the Offer on or prior to the expiration date, unless due primarily to the Company s material breach of the agreement; (ii) to enter into a definitive agreement for a Superior Proposal; (iii) Crown leaves a material breach uncured, which breach would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the ability of Crown or Merger Sub to consummate the Merger; and (iv) if the conditions to closing are satisfied, the Company is prepared to close, and the Buyer Parties fail to close. These provisions could discourage a potential competing acquirer that might have an interest in acquiring all or a significant part of our business from considering or making a competing acquisition proposal, even if the potential competing acquirer was prepared to pay consideration with a higher per share cash value than the market value proposed to be received or realized in the Offer and the Merger, or might cause a potential competing acquirer to propose to pay a lower price than it might otherwise have proposed to pay because of the added expense of the termination fee and other costs that may become payable in certain circumstances under the Merger Agreement. 
 Management has concluded there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. 
 
 We are not profitable and have incurred losses each year since we commenced operations in 2002. As of September 30, 2024, we had capital resources of 184.1 million consisting of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments. Based on our current operating plan, excluding any impact from the pending consummation of the Merger, our existing cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments will not allow us to fund our operations for at least 12 months following the filing of this Report. Also, we are required to maintain compliance with the Minimum Cash Covenant in accordance with the terms of the Note Purchase Agreement. As a result, management has concluded that there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. In order to mitigate the substantial doubt to continue as a going concern, we may be required to refinance our debt, conduct additional financings, restructure operations, sell assets or reduce our operating expenses. 
 Additional capital may not be available when needed, on terms that are acceptable to us or at all. If adequate funds are not available to us on a timely basis, or at all, we may be required to take capital preservation measures, including to reduce operating expense and delay, reduce the scope of, discontinue or alter our sales and marketing capabilities; research and development activities; or other activities that may be necessary to continue to commercialize our Products and other aspects of our business plan. If we are unable to generate sufficient revenue to fulfill our operating plan, secure additional capital when needed or sufficiently reduce our operating expenses, we may be unable to comply with the Minimum Cash Covenant or continue to operate our business. For more information on consequences under the Note Purchase Agreement, see our FY2023 Form 10-K, Item 1A - We may not have cash available in an amount sufficient to enable us to make interest or principal payments on our indebtedness when due.

 If we raise additional capital through marketing and distribution arrangements, royalty financings or other collaborations, strategic alliances or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may need to relinquish certain valuable rights to our product candidates, technologies, future revenue streams or research programs or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we raise additional capital through debt financing, we may be subject to specified financial covenants or covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or pursuing certain transactions, any of which could restrict our ability to commercialize our product candidates or operate as a business; and our assets may be subject to liens. In addition, our ability to raise capital may be limited by restrictions under the Note Purchase Agreement, including our ability to sell or license intellectual property, and other reasons like the global economy, inflation or other macroeconomic factors.
