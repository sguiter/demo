We utilize a five-year lookback period to establish our estimate of expected credit losses, as our contractual terms range from three to five years. Based on that assessment, the allowance for credit losses as a percent of gross contract assets increased to 23.4 at September 30, 2024 from 20.0 at December 31, 2023.

The allowance for credit losses is determined principally based on an assessment of origination year and past collection experience as well as consideration of current and future economic conditions and changes in our customer collection trends. Based on that assessment, the allowance for credit losses as a percent of gross equipment financing receivables (net of unearned income) increased to at September 30, 2024 from at December 31, 2023. The allowance for credit losses represents an estimate of the losses expected to be incurred from the Company's equipment financing receivable portfolio. The projected loss rates are primarily based upon historical loss experience adjusted for judgments about the probable effects of relevant observable data including current and future economic conditions as well as delinquency trends, resolution rates, and the aging of receivables. The allowance for credit losses for equipment finance receivables is inherently more difficult to estimate than the allowance for trade receivables because the underlying lease portfolio has an average maturity, at any time, of approximately three to five years and contains unbilled amounts. We consider all available information in our quarterly assessments of the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses. We believe our estimates, including any qualitative adjustments, are reasonable and have considered all reasonably available information about past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future events and economic conditions. The identification of account-specific exposure is not a significant factor in establishing the allowance for credit losses for equipment finance receivables. We continue to monitor developments in future economic conditions and trends, and as a result, our reserve may need to be updated in future periods.

Our effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was and ), respectively, which resulted in an income tax benefit/(provision) of ) and ), respectively. As of each reporting date, management considers new evidence, both positive and negative, that could affect its view of the future realization of deferred tax assets. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income in the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. We reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if, based on the evidence available, it is more-likely-than-not that such assets will not be realized. In making the assessment under the more-likely-than-not standard, appropriate consideration must be given to all positive and negative evidence related to the realization of the deferred tax assets. This assessment considers, among other matters, the nature, frequency and severity of current and cumulative losses, forecasts of future profitability, the duration of statutory carry-forward periods by jurisdiction, unitary versus stand-alone state tax filings, our experience with loss carryforwards expiring unutilized, and all tax planning alternatives that may be available. As of December 31, 2023, management reviewed the weight of all the positive and negative evidence available. Management reviewed negative evidence such as three years of cumulative pretax loss in the U.S. federal tax jurisdiction, and positive evidence such as projections of future pretax income and the duration of statutory carry-forward periods. As of December 31, 2023 the Company has a cumulative pretax loss for the three year lookback excluding the gain on the sale of property and equipment, which is considered significant objectively verifiable negative evidence. Management also evaluated projections of future pretax income and the duration of statutory carry-forward periods to determine if the NOL carryforwards could be utilized in whole or in part before they expire unutilized. Forecasts and projections of future income are inherently subjective and therefore generally are given less weight, based on the extent to which the assumptions can be objectively verified based on historical experience. Although historical trends utilized in our projections are objectively verifiable we assigned less weight to this positive evidence given the subjective nature of assumptions in projections. Management reviewed negative evidence related to experience of credits and loss carryforwards expiring unutilized, and determined that although negative evidence exists, it was not significant evidence, as the current loss carryforwards do not begin to expire until 2032 and therefore risk is minimal. After reviewing the weight of the positive and negative evidence, management determined that the positive evidence was not sufficient enough to overcome the negative evidence of cumulative pretax losses for the three-year lookback to conclude that it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets of are realizable. Therefore, a valuation allowance of was recorded against our gross deferred tax asset balance as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 25 Table of Contents . On August 9, 2023, in connection with the sale of our corporate office building and land, we entered into a lease agreement to leaseback the property. The operating lease agreement has an initial term of eighteen full calendar months, with an option to terminate the lease on the last day of the twelfth full calendar month with a ninety-day notice.

The CAM charges are considered a separate non-lease component of the lease agreement and are excluded from the measurement of the lease liability.

OVERVIEW Crexendo, Inc. is an award-winning software technology company that is a premier provider of cloud communication platform and services, video collaboration and managed IT services tailored to businesses of all sizes. By providing a variety of comprehensive and scalable solutions, we are able to cater to businesses of all sizes on a monthly subscription basis without the need for expensive capital investments, regardless of where their business is in its lifecycle. Our products and services can be categorized in the following offerings: Cloud Telecommunications Services Our cloud telecommunications services transmit calls using IP or cloud technology, which converts voice signals into digital data packets for transmission over the Internet or cloud. Each of our calling plans provides a number of basic features typically offered by traditional telephone service providers, plus a wide range of enhanced features that we believe offer an attractive value proposition to our customers. This platform enables a user, via a single identity or telephone number, to access and utilize services and features regardless of how the user is connected to the Internet or cloud, whether it s from a desktop device or an application on a mobile device. We generate recurring revenue from our cloud telecommunications services, broadband Internet services, managed IT services, software license sales, and infrastructure as a service. Our cloud telecommunications contracts typically have a thirty-nine to ninety-month term. We may also charge activation and flash fees and the Company generally allocates a portion of the activation fees to the desktop devices, which is recognized at the time of the installation or customer acceptance, and a portion to the service, which is recognized over the contract term using the straight-line method. We also charge other various contracted and non-contracted fees. We generate product revenue, equipment financing revenue, and device as a service revenue from the sale and lease of our cloud telecommunications equipment. Revenues from the sale of equipment, including those from sales-type leases, are recognized at the time of sale or at the inception of the lease, as appropriate. Software Solutions Our software solutions segment derives revenues from three primary sources: software licenses, software maintenance support and professional services. Software and services may be sold separately or in bundled packages. Generally, contracts with customers contain multiple performance obligations, consisting of software and services. For bundled packages, the Company accounts for individual products and services separately if they are distinct i.e. if a product or service is separately identifiable from other items in the bundled package and if a customer can benefit from it on its own or with other resources that are readily available to the customer. The consideration is allocated between separate products and services in a bundle based on their relative stand-alone selling prices. The stand-alone selling prices are determined based on the prices at which the Company separately sells the software licenses and professional services. For items that are not sold separately (e.g. additional features) the Company estimates stand-alone selling prices using the adjusted market assessment approach. When we provide a free trial period, we do not begin to recognize recurring revenue until the trial period has ended and the customer has been billed for the services. We generate software license revenue from the sale of perpetual software licenses, term-based software licenses that expire, and Software-as-a-Service ("SaaS") based software which are referred to as subscription arrangements. The Company does not recognize software revenue related to the renewal of subscription software licenses earlier than the beginning of the subscription period. We generate subscription and maintenance support revenue from customer support and other supportive services. The Company offers warranties on its products. The warranty period for our licensed software is generally 90 days. Certain of the Company's warranties are considered to be assurance-type in nature and do not cover anything beyond ensuring that the product is functioning as intended. Based on the guidance in ASC 606, assurance-type warranties do not represent separate performance obligations. The Company also sells separately-priced maintenance service contracts, which qualify as service-type warranties and represent separate performance obligations. The Company does not typically allow and has no history of accepting material product returns. Customer support includes software updates on a when-and-if-available basis, telephone support, integrated web-based support and bug fixes or patches. Subscription and maintenance support revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the customer support agreement, which is typically one year. 30 Table of Contents We generate professional services and other revenue from consulting, technical support, resident engineer services, design services and installation services. Revenue for professional services and other is recognized when the performance obligation is complete and the customer has accepted the performance obligation.

USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES To evaluate our business, we consider and use non-generally accepted accounting principles Non-GAAP net income, EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental measure of operating performance. These measures include the same adjustments that management takes into account when it reviews and assesses operating performance on a period-to-period basis. We consider Non-GAAP net income to be an important indicator of overall business performance because it allows us to evaluate results without the effects of share-based compensation, acquisition related expenses, changes in fair value of contingent consideration, amortization of intangibles, and goodwill and long-lived asset impairment. We define EBITDA as U.S. GAAP net income/(loss) before interest expense, interest income and other expense/(income), the gain/(loss) on the sale of property and equipment, goodwill and long-lived asset impairments, provision/(benefit) for income taxes, and depreciation and amortization. We believe EBITDA provides a useful metric to investors to compare us with other companies within our industry and across industries. We define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA adjusted for acquisition related expenses, changes in fair value of contingent consideration and share-based compensation. We use Adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental measure to review and assess operating performance. We also believe use of Adjusted EBITDA facilitates investors use of operating performance comparisons from period to period, as well as across companies. In our November 6, 2024 earnings press release, as furnished on Form 8-K, we included Non-GAAP net income, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA. The terms Non-GAAP net income, EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA are not defined under U.S. GAAP, and are not measures of operating income, operating performance or liquidity presented in analytical tools, and when assessing our operating performance, Non-GAAP net income, EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for net income/(loss) or other consolidated income statement data prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Some of these limitations include, but are not limited to: EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; they do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; they do not reflect the interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, on our debt that we may incur; they do not reflect income taxes or the cash requirements for any tax payments; although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will be replaced sometime in the future, and EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements; while share-based compensation is a component of operating expense, the impact on our financial statements compared to other companies can vary significantly due to such factors as the assumed life of the options and the assumed volatility of our common stock; and other companies may calculate EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA differently than we do, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures. 34 Table of Contents We compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our U.S. GAAP results and using Non-GAAP net income, EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA only as supplemental support for management s analysis of business performance. Non-GAAP net income, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are calculated as follows for the periods presented. RECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES In accordance with the requirements of Regulation G issued by the SEC, we are presenting the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures and reconciling the unaudited Non-GAAP financial metrics to the comparable U.S. GAAP measures.

Impact of Recent Accounting Pronouncements The information set forth under Note 1 to the condensed consolidated financial statements under the caption Recent Accounting Pronouncements is incorporated herein by reference. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Foreign Currency Risk For all periods presented, our sales and operating expenses were predominately denominated in U.S. dollars. We therefore have not had material foreign currency risk associated with sales and cost-based activities. The functional currency of our material operating entities is the U.S. dollar. For the periods presented, we believe the exposure to foreign currency fluctuation from operating expenses is immaterial as the related costs do not constitute a significant portion of our total expenses. As we grow operations, our exposure to foreign currency risk may become more significant. Inflation Risk We do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. If our costs were to become subject to significant inflationary pressures, we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs through price increases. Our inability or failure to do so could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. Item 4. Controls and Procedures Conclusion Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, after evaluating the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )) as of the end of the period covered by this Report, have concluded that, based on the evaluation of these controls and procedures, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the three months ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 47 Table of Contents PART II - OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. Legal Proceedings From time to time, we are involved in lawsuits, claims, investigations and proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business. There are no matters pending or threatened that we expect to have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. Item 1A. Risk Factors There are many risk factors that may affect our business and the results of our operations, many of which are beyond our control. Information on certain risks that we believe are material to our business is set forth in Part I Item 1A. Risk Factors of the 2023 Form 10-K. Item 2.
