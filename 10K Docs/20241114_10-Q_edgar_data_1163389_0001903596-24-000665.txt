 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

In June 2022, the
Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASU 2022-03, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Fair Value Measurement of
Equity Securities Subject to Contractual Sale Restrictions. ASU 2022-03 clarifies that a contractual restriction on the sale of
an equity security is not considered part of the unit of account of the equity security and, therefore, is not considered in measuring
fair value. ASU 2022-03 was effective for the Company on January 1, 2024. The adoption of ASU 2022-03 had no material impact on the consolidated
financial statements. 

In August 2020, the
Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2020-06 Debt Debt with Conversion
and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging Contracts in Entity s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Accounting
for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity s Own Equity. The ASU simplifies accounting for convertible instruments
by removing major separation models required under current U.S. GAAP. Consequently, more convertible debt instruments will be reported
as a single liability instrument and more convertible preferred stock as a single equity instrument with no separate accounting for embedded
conversion features. The ASU removes certain settlement conditions that are required for equity contracts to qualify for the derivative
scope exception, which will permit more equity contracts to qualify for it. The ASU also simplifies the diluted earnings per share (EPS)
calculation in certain areas. In addition, the amendment updates the disclosure requirements for convertible instruments to increase
the information transparency. ASU 2020-06 was effective for the Company on January 1, 2024. The adoption of ASU 2020-06 had no material
impact on the consolidated financial statements.

Prompt corrective
action regulations provide five classifications: well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized
and critically undercapitalized, although these terms are not used to represent overall financial condition. If adequately capitalized,
regulatory approval is required to accept brokered deposits. If undercapitalized, capital distributions are limited, as is asset growth
and expansion, and capital restoration plans are required. At September 30, 2024, the most recent regulatory notifications categorized
the Bank as well capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action. There are no conditions or events since that
notification that management believes have changed the institution's category. 

 The Bank s
actual capital amounts and ratios are presented in the following table as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.

As of September 30,
2024, there were 165 securities in a loss position, of which 163 have been in a loss position for twelve months or more. Management believes
that all unrealized losses have resulted from temporary changes in the interest rates and current market conditions and are not a result
of credit deterioration. Aside from strategic sales executed during the three months ended September 30, 2024, management does not plan
to sell, and it is not likely that the Bank will be required to sell any of the securities referenced in the table above before recovery
of their amortized cost. None of the individual securities are past due as to principal or interest payments and a number of these securities
have explicit or implicit payment guarantees. The remaining securities have credit ratings at or above that necessary to be considered
 bank qualified. 

Investment securities
with a carrying value of million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, were pledged as
collateral to secure public deposits and for other purposes required or permitted by law. 

During the three
and nine months ended September 30, 2024 available-for-sale investment securities with a carrying value of million were sold, realizing
a net gain of . There were no sales of available-for-sale investment securities during the three and nine months ended September
30, 2023. 

The amortized cost
and fair value of investment securities as of September 30, 2024, by contractual maturity, are shown in the following schedule. Expected
maturities will differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without
call or prepayment penalties.

The Bank, as a member
bank of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond Federal Reserve Bank and the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta (FHLB), is
required to hold stock in each. The Bank also owns stock in CBB Financial Corp., which is a correspondent of the Bank. These equity securities,
which are included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheet, are restricted from trading and are recorded at a cost of 
million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The stock has no quoted market value and no ready
market exists. When evaluating these securities for impairment, their value is determined based on the ultimate recoverability of the
par value rather than by recognizing temporary declines in value. Equity securities are viewed as long-term investments and management
believes the Company has the ability and the intent to hold these securities until their value is recovered.

deferred fees and costs is recognized over the lives of the respective loans as a yield adjustment. If loans repay prior to scheduled
maturities any unamortized fees or costs is recognized at that time.

The Company categorizes
loans receivable into risk categories based on relevant information about the ability of borrowers to service their debt such as: current
financial information, historical payment experience, credit documentation, public information, and current economic trends, among other
factors. The Company analyzes loans individually by classifying the loans receivable as to credit risk. The Company uses the following
definitions for risk ratings: 

Pass - Loans
in this category are considered to have a low likelihood of loss based on relevant information analyzed about the ability of the borrowers
to service their debt and other factors. 

Special Mention
 - Loans in this category are currently protected but are potentially weak, including adverse trends in borrower s operations,
credit quality or financial strength. Those loans constitute an undue and unwarranted credit risk but not to the point of justifying
a substandard classification. The credit risk may be relatively minor yet constitute an unwarranted risk in light of the circumstances.
 Special mention loans have potential weaknesses which may, if not checked or corrected, weaken the loan or inadequately protect
the Company s credit position at some future date. 

Substandard 
- A substandard loan is inadequately protected by the current sound net worth and paying capacity of the
obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. Loans classified as substandard must have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize
the liquidation of the debt; they are characterized by the distinct possibility that the institution will sustain some loss if the deficiencies
are not corrected. 

Doubtful
 - Loans classified doubtful have all the weaknesses
inherent in loans classified as substandard, plus the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full
on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values highly questionable and improbable.

Balance, end of period 

As of September 30,
2024, four loans secured by residential real estate totaling 111,000 and one loan secured by commercial real estate totaling 268,000
were in the process of foreclosure. 

In accordance with
this guidance, the Company groups its financial assets and financial liabilities generally measured at fair value in three levels, based
on the markets in which the assets and liabilities are traded and the reliability of the assumptions used to determine fair value. 

Level 1:
Quoted prices are available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reported date. 

Level 2:
Pricing inputs are other than quoted prices in active markets, which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reported
date. The nature of these assets and liabilities include items for which quoted prices are available but traded less frequently, and
items that are valued using other financial instruments, the parameters of which can be directly observed. 

Level 3:
Assets and liabilities that have little to no pricing observability as of the reported date. These items do not have two-way markets
and are measured using management s best estimate of fair value, where the inputs into the determination of fair value require
significant management judgment or estimation. 

A description of
the valuation methodologies used for instruments measured at fair value, as well as the general classification of such instruments pursuant
to the valuation hierarchy are as follows: 

Investment Securities
Available-for-sale - Investment securities available-for-sale are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. The Company s available-for-sale
securities, totaling 96.6 million and 89.8 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, are the only assets
whose fair values are measured on a recurring basis using Level 2 inputs from an independent pricing service. 

Collateral Dependent
Loans with an ACL - In accordance with ASC 326, we may determine that an individual loan exhibits unique risk characteristics which differentiate
it from other loans within our loan pools. In such cases, the loans are evaluated for expected credit losses on an individual basis and
excluded from the collective evaluation. Specific allocations of the allowance for credit losses are determined by analyzing the borrower's
ability to repay amounts owed, collateral deficiencies, the relative risk grade of the loan and economic conditions affecting the borrower's
industry, among other things. A loan is considered to be collateral dependent when, based upon management's assessment, the borrower
is experiencing financial difficulty and repayment is expected to be provided substantially through the operation or sale of the collateral.
In such cases, expected credit losses are based on the fair value of the collateral at the measurement date, adjusted for estimated selling
costs if satisfaction of the loan depends on the sale of the collateral. We reevaluate the fair value of collateral supporting collateral
dependent loans on a quarterly basis. The fair value of real estate collateral supporting collateral dependent loans is evaluated by
appraisal services using a methodology that is consistent with the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice. 

Other Real Estate
Owned Other real estate owned is adjusted to fair value upon transfer of the loans, or former bank premises, to other real estate
owned. These assets are carried at the lower of their carrying value or fair value. Fair value is based upon observable market prices,
when available, reduced by estimated disposition costs, which the Company considers to be nonrecurring Level 2 inputs. When observable
market prices are not available, management determines the fair value of the foreclosed asset using independent third-party appraisals,
evaluated to determine whether or not the property is further impaired below the appraised value, and adjusts for estimated costs of
disposition. The Company records foreclosed assets as nonrecurring Level 3. 

Assets and liabilities
measured at fair value are as follows as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023:

Fair Value
of Financial Instruments 

Fair value information
about financial instruments, whether or not recognized in the balance sheet, for which it is practical to estimate the value is based
upon the characteristics of the instruments and relevant market information. Financial instruments include cash, evidence of ownership
in an entity, or contracts that convey or impose on an entity that contractual right or obligation to either receive or deliver cash
for another financial instrument. 

The
following summary presents the methodologies and assumptions used to estimate the fair value of the Company s financial instruments
presented below. The information used to determine fair value is highly subjective and judgmental in nature and, therefore, the results
may not be precise. Subjective factors include, among other things, estimates of cash flows, risk characteristics, credit quality, and
interest rates, all of which are subject to change. Since the fair value is estimated as of the balance sheet date, the amounts that
will actually be realized or paid upon settlement or maturity on these various instruments could be significantly different. 

The carrying amount
and fair value of the Company s financial instruments that are not required to be measured or reported at fair value on a recurring
basis as of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, are as follows: 

Financial instruments liabilities 

Time deposits 

Borrowed funds

Fair value estimates
are made at a specific point in time, based on relevant market information and information about the financial instrument. These estimates
do not reflect any premium or discount that could result from offering for sale at one time the Company s entire holdings of a
particular financial instrument. Because no market exists for a significant portion of the Company s financial instruments, fair
value estimates are based on judgments regarding future expected loss experience, current economic conditions, risk characteristics of
various financial instruments and other factors. These estimates are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of significant
judgment and therefore cannot be determined with precision. Changes in assumptions can significantly affect the estimates. 

Estimated fair values
have been determined by the Company using historical data, as generally provided in the Company s regulatory reports, and an estimation
methodology suitable for each category of financial instruments. The Company s fair value estimates, methods and assumptions are
set forth below for the Company s other financial instruments. 

The carrying values
of cash and due from banks, interest-bearing deposits with banks, federal funds sold, bank owned life insurance, deposits with no stated
maturities, and accrued interest approximates fair value and are excluded from the table above.

Critical Accounting
Policies 

For discussion of
our significant accounting policies, see our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, and Note 2 Summary of Significant
Accounting Policies, in Item 1 of this Form 10-Q. Certain critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates
used in the preparation of our financial statements. Our most critical accounting policies relate to our allowance for credit losses. 

The allowance for
credit losses reflects the estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. If the financial
condition of our borrowers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, our estimates would be
updated, and additional provisions could be required. For further discussion of the estimates used in determining the allowance for credit
losses, we refer you to the section on Asset Quality in this discussion. 

Overview and Highlights 

Net income for the
three months ended September 30, 2024 was 2.1 million, an increase of 218,000, or 11.53 , from the same period in 2023. Net interest
income increased 1.99 , or 140,000, from 7.0 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023 to 7.2 million for the quarter ended
September 30, 2024. The increase was primarily due to an increase in interest income of 2.0 million to 11.5 million due to the combination
of an increase of 57 basis points bps in the yield on earning assets to 5.51 , and a 65.5 million increase in the average
balance of earning assets. 

The balance sheet
grew to 880.3 million in total assets as of September 30, 2024, from 826.3 million as of December 31, 2023. Gross loans increased 8.2
million to 646.4 million as of September 30, 2024. Additionally, interest-bearing deposits in other banks increased 40.2 million to
 90.6 million as of September 30, 2024. Total deposit liabilities as of September 30, 2024 increased 47.1 million to 763.6 million
from December 31, 2023. 

On September 27,
2024 Hurricane Helene passed through western North Carolina, southwest Virginia and northeast Tennessee, causing flood and wind damage
in its path. We are assessing the impact of this event on our customers and any collateral securing outstanding loans. At this time,
we are not aware of any widespread impairment of collateral, but we continue to monitor the effects of this event and will address any
situations as needed, including providing payment relief to affected borrowers. 

During the first
quarter of 2024, we extended a previously announced stock repurchase program, to continue through March 31, 2025. During the third quarter
of 2024, 23,989 shares were repurchased at an average price of 2.67 per share. 

Comparison of
the Three Months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 

Quarter-to-date highlights
include: 

Returns
 on average assets and equity of 0.97 and 12.35 for the third quarter of 2024, compared
 to 0.94 and 12.38 for the third quarter of 2023, respectively; 

Net
 interest income was 7.2 million for the third quarter of 2024, an increase of 140,000,
 or 1.99 , compared to the third quarter of 2023; 

The
 provision for credit losses was 49,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared
 to a provision of 155,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023; 

Noninterest
 income was 2.4 million, a 10,000 decrease during the third quarter of 2024 compared to
 the third quarter of 2023; and 

Noninterest
 expense was 6.8 million, a decrease of 54,000, or 0.78 , for the third quarter of 2024
 compared to the third quarter of 2023. 

During the three
months ended September 30, 2024, interest income increased 2.0 million to 11.5 million due to the combination of an increase of 57
basis points bps in the yield on earning assets to 5.51 , and a 65.5 million increase in the average balance of earning
assets. The loan portfolio was the primary driver of both increases, as the yield rose 62 bps to 6.05 , while the average balance increased
 21.7 million for the comparative quarters ending September 30, 2024 and 2023. The increased interest income was offset by increased
interest expense which rose 1.8 million to 4.4 million during the third quarter of 2024 as compared to 2.5 million reported for the
same period in 2023. Interest-bearing deposits accounted for 1.7 million of the increase as the average rate increased 110 bps and the
average balance increased 59.7 million for the comparative quarters ending September 30, 2024 and 2023. Additionally, while the average
cost of borrowed funds decreased 64 bps to 5.77 , the related interest expense increased 100,000
due to the increased average balance related to a 10.0 million borrowing from the Federal Reserve Bank under the Bank Term Funding Program
taken in the fourth quarter of 2023, which increased the overall outstanding average balance by 9.7 million. The net interest margin
decreased 20 bps, to 3.43 for the quarter ending September 30, 2024, as compared to the 3.63 net interest margin for the same period
in 2023 due to the increase in funding costs outpacing improvements in the yield on earning assets; however, growth in earning assets
offset the impact of a smaller net interest margin, resulting in the 140,000 increase in net interest income. 

25 

On September 18,
2024 the Federal Open Market Committee FOMC of the Federal Reserve Board lowered the targeted federal funds rate by 50
bps in response to easing inflation and softening employment numbers. This was the first rate cut since the FOMC began increasing rates
in March of 2022. On November 7, 2024 the FOMC reduced the federal funds rate another 25 bps. As a result of these actions, interest
earned on immediately repriceable loans tied to the prime interest rate and interest-earning funds held with other financial institutions,
including the Federal Reserve Bank, have decreased 75 bps. The Bank has responded by lowering the rates on some deposit products. Although
there are indications of more rate cuts to follow, future actions by the FOMC cannot be reasonably estimated, due to a number of factors
including future economic and unemployment data. We continually monitor our rate sensitive assets and liabilities and assess opportunities
to manage these assets and liabilities to maximize returns and mitigate downside risks. 

The following table
shows the rates paid on earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities for the periods indicated:

The provision for
credit losses charged to the income statement for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 49,000 compared to a provision of 155,000
for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The provision for credit losses in the third quarter of 2024 was impacted by the resolution
of a loan relationship that had resulted in a 263,000 specific allowance allocation during the second quarter of 2024. For a discussion
of the factors affecting the allowance for credit losses, including provision expense, refer to Note 7, Allowance for Credit Losses for
Loans, in Item 1 of this Form 10-Q and Asset Quality, below. 

Noninterest income
was largely unchanged for the comparative three month periods, decreasing 10,000 to 2.4 million for the quarter ended September 30,
2024 from 2.4 million for the comparable quarter in 2023. Modest decreases in earnings from service charges of 25,000, card processing
activities of 5,000 and other noninterest income of 23,000, were largely offset by increased revenue from financial services which
increased 36,000. 

Noninterest
expense was 6.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 6.9 million for the quarter ended September 30,
2023. The 54,000 improvement resulted from modest decreases in salaries and benefits of 40,000, and occupancy expenses of 3,000.
In addition, legal and professional fees, loan and loan related expenses, included in other operating expenses, decreased by a
combined 90,000. These decreases offset increases in data processing and telecommunication expenses and other noninterest expenses
of 10,000 and 59,000, respectively. 

The efficiency ratio,
which is defined as noninterest expense divided by the sum of net interest income plus noninterest income, decreased to 71.10 during
the third quarter of 2024 from 72.62 for the third quarter of 2023. We continue to assess our operational procedures and structure to
improve efficiencies and contain costs. 

Income tax expense
for the third quarter of 2024 totaled 621,000, an increase of 72,000, or 13.11 , from 549,000 recorded during the same period in 2023.
The effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was 22.76 , compared to 22.51 for the same period in 2023. A contributor
to the increase to the effective tax rate is the increase in revenue generated in states which assess income tax.

Net interest income
is affected by changes in both average interest rates and average volumes (balances) of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing
liabilities. The following table sets forth the amounts of the total changes in interest income and interest expense which can be attributed

Based on our
current assessment of the loan portfolio and related unfunded commitments, a provision of 478,000 was made for the nine months
ended September 30, 2024. The allowance for credit losses as a percentage of loans increased from 1.14 at December 31, 2023 to
1.19 as of September 30, 2024. For a discussion of the factors affecting the allowance for credit losses, including provision
expense, refer to Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 7, Allowance for Credit Losses, in Item 1 of this Form
10-Q, and Asset Quality, below. 

For the nine months
ended September 30, 2024, noninterest income increased 42,000 to 7.3 million from 7.2 million for the same period in 2023. The increase
is due largely to financial services revenue of 998,000, an increase of 168,000, or 20.24 , from the 830,000 recorded during the first
nine months of 2023. Service charges and card processing revenue totaling 2.9 million and 2.8 million respectively were largely unchanged
from 2023. These improvements were partially offset by the impact of the sales of bank properties in 2024 and 2023. During the first
nine months of 2024, a former branch office and a lot were sold, along with the sale of furniture, resulting in a net gain of 23,000.
During the same period of 2023, two former office facilities and a vehicle were sold resulting in a net gain of 135,000. 

For the nine months
ended September 30, 2024, noninterest expense decreased 141,000 to 20.6 million compared to 20.8 million for the nine months ended
September 30, 2023. The decrease was impacted by reductions in occupancy costs of 26,000 combined with decreases in legal and professional
fees of 140,000, consulting fees of 57,000 and loan and other real estate owned expenses of 98,000, excluding net gains on sales of
other real estate owned. The expense reductions were partially offset by increases in advertising of 19,000, ATM network expenses of
 25,000 and miscellaneous expenses of 131,000 which combined for an increase of 175,000. 

29 

Balance Sheet 

Total assets as of
September 30, 2024 were 880.3 million, an increase of 54.0 million, or 6.53 , from 826.3 million as of December 31, 2023. Gross loans
of 646.4 million as of September 30, 2024 reflected an increase of 8.2 million from 638.1 million at December 31, 2023. Liquid assets
in the form of cash and cash equivalents increased 38.8 million or 59.64 during the first nine months of 2024. Investment securities
increased 6.8 million during the first nine months of 2024 due to purchases of 14.0 million, which more than offset sales of 2.1 million,
and maturities, payments and amortization of 8.2 million and a 3.3 million decrease in the unrealized loss on securities available
for sale. During the third quarter of 2024, odd lot investment securities totaling 2.1 million were sold, and the proceeds were used
to reinvest in other securities. These sales generated a net gain of 4,000. 

Consumer loans increased 5.5 million, or 24.10 which included
the purchase of 2.5 million of individual loans, and the funding of 1.8 million of private student loans during the first nine months
of 2024. Commercial real estate and commercial loans increased 5.3 million and 3.4 million, respectively, during the first nine months
of 2024. Residential 1-4 family loans decreased 6.0 million from December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024. Loan originations during the
first nine months of 2024 were impacted by higher interest rates affecting borrower requests. 

Total deposits were
 763.6 million as of September 30, 2024 compared to 716.5 million as of December 31, 2023. The increase of 47.1 million, or 6.57 ,
was due to efforts to attract and retain time deposits and money market account relationships, combined with cyclical funds inflows.
As a result of these efforts, total time deposits increased 25.1 million, including 3.0 million of brokered time deposits, and money
market accounts increased 27.1 million during the first nine months of 2024, respectively. The increase in time and money market deposits
contributed to the increase in our cost of funds, as previously discussed, due to the continuing repricing of maturing time deposits
in the higher interest rate environment combined with ongoing competition for deposits. 

As of September 30,
2024, borrowed funds totaled 36.2 million, unchanged from December 31, 2023. Since September 30, 2024, 10.0 million borrowed from the
Federal Reserve Bank under the Bank Term Funding Program has been repaid, and a 1.2 million principal reduction was paid toward outstanding
trust preferred securities. These repayments made from available liquidity, will improve net interest income and the net interest margin
in future periods. 

During the first
nine months of 2024, total shareholders equity increased 6.3 million to 71.1 million as of September 30, 2024, due to net income
of 5.6 million and a decrease in the net unrealized loss on available-for-sale investment securities of 2.6 million which was offset
by dividends paid to shareholders of 1.7 million and the repurchase of common stock totaling 239,000. Additional discussion of shareholders 
equity is presented in the Capital Resources discussion below. 

Asset Quality 

The allowance for
credit losses was 7.7 million, or 1.19 as a percentage of total loans, as of September 30, 2024, and 7.3 million, or 1.14 , as of
December 31, 2023. The allowance for credit losses on unfunded commitments was 309,000 as of September 30, 2024 as compared to 285,000
at December 31, 2023. 

Annualized net charge-offs
as a percentage of average loans was 0.01 during the first nine months of 2024 compared to 0.03 during the same period of 2023. 

Nonperforming assets,
which include nonaccrual loans and other real estate owned, totaled 5.1 million as of September 30, 2024, an increase of 1.4 million,
or 39.34 , since year-end 2023. Nonperforming assets as a percentage of total assets were 0.58 as of September 30, 2024 and 0.45 as
of December 31, 2023. 

Other real estate
owned increased 903,000 to 1.1 million as of September 30, 2024 compared to December 31, 2023. The increase was due to the foreclosure
of a commercial property, which is anticipated to be sold during the fourth quarter of 2024. Expenses associated with other real estate
owned were 13,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, excluding the effects of the sales of foreclosed properties during the
second and third quarters of 2024 which resulted in a gain of 44,000, compared to expenses of 23,000 during the nine months ended September
30, 2023. Nonaccrual loans increased 550,000 to 4.1 million as of September 30, 2024 from 3.5 million at December 31, 2023, largely
due to a commercial real estate loan moving to nonaccrual status. 

For detailed information
on nonaccrual loans and other real estate owned as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, refer to Note 6 Loans and Note 10 Other
Real Estate Owned in Item 1 of this Form 10-Q. 

Loans rated substandard
or below totaled 4.8 million as of September 30, 2024, an increase of 1.3 million from 3.5 million as of December 31, 2023. Total
past due loans increased to 7.3 million as of September 30, 2024 from 6.2 million as of
December 31, 2023. The increase in past due loans is largely attributed to an increase in residential mortgage loans 30-59 days past
due. 

30 

The allowance for
credit losses is maintained at a level that management deems appropriate to absorb any potential future losses and known impairments
within the loan portfolio, whether or not the losses are actually ever realized. Through our quarterly assessment, we continue to adjust
the CECL model to best reflect the risks in the portfolio. However, future provisions may be deemed necessary. During the first nine
months of 2024, we maintained the adjustments to our qualitative factors initiated in 2023, to consider risk factors associated with
commercial real estate and residential mortgage loans, however the qualitative adjustment for commercial real estate loans was reduced
as factors used in determining the adjustment have begun to be reflected in the portfolio as it seasons. Additionally, in consideration
of the impact of Hurricane Helene on the financial performance of borrowers and the underlying loan collateral, a
qualitative factor adjustment was made for September 30, 2024. Those changes, along with net charge-offs for the period and the assessment
of the historical and specific risks associated with the loan portfolio, resulted in a provision for credit losses of 478,000, of which
 453,000 was a provision for the loan portfolio; and a provision for unfunded commitments of 25,000. The following table summarizes
components of the allowance for credit losses and related loans as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023:

Deferred Tax Asset
and Income Taxes 

Due to timing differences
between the book and tax treatments of several income and expense items, a net deferred tax asset, excluding the deferred tax asset on
the unrealized loss on securities available-for-sale of 2.4 million and 3.1 million, existed as of September 30, 2024 and December
31, 2023, respectively. Our income tax expense was computed at the corporate income tax rate of 21 of taxable income. We have no significant
nontaxable income or nondeductible expenses. 

Capital Resources 

The Company meets
the eligibility criteria to be classified as a small bank holding company in accordance with the Federal Reserve s Small Bank Holding
Company Policy Statement issued in February 2015 and is therefore not obligated to report consolidated regulatory capital. The Bank continues
to be subject to various capital requirements administered by banking agencies. 

The Bank s capital ratios along
with the minimum regulatory thresholds to be considered well-capitalized are presented in Note 4 in Item 1 of this Form 10-Q. 

As of September 30,
2024, the Bank remains well capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action. The ratios mentioned above for the
Bank comply with the Federal Reserve rules to align with the Basel III Capital requirements. 

Book value per common
share was 3.00 and 2.73 as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The increase in book value was due to the net
income of 5.6 million for the first nine months of 2024, which exceeded the dividend payment of 0.07 per share paid during the first
quarter of 2024, combined with the 2.6 million decrease in the unrealized loss on available for sale investment securities and the 239,000
repurchase of common shares during the first nine months of 2024.

 - Annualized 

Under current economic
conditions, we believe it is prudent to continue to retain capital sufficient to support planned asset growth while being able to absorb
potential losses that may occur if asset quality deteriorates, and based upon projections, we believe our current capital levels will
be sufficient. 

During the first
quarter of 2024, the Company paid a cash dividend of 0.07 per common share to our shareholders. Future payments of cash dividends will
depend on a number of factors including but not limited to maintaining positive retained earnings, compliance with regulatory rules governing
the payment of dividends, strategic plans, and sufficient capital at the Bank to allow payment of dividends to the Company. 

On April 28, 2022
the board of directors of the Company authorized the repurchase of up to 500,000 shares of the Company s outstanding common stock.
As previously reported, this plan was extended by the Board of Directors through March 31, 2025. The actual means and timing of any purchases,
number of shares and prices or range of prices will be determined by the Company in its discretion and will depend on a number of factors,
including the market price of the Company s common stock, general market and economic conditions, and applicable legal and regulatory
requirements. As of September 30, 2024, the Company has repurchased 270,018 shares at an average price of 2.40 per share since the inception
of the plan. During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, the Company repurchased 23,989 shares at an average price of 2.67 per share.
There is no assurance that the Company will purchase any additional shares under this program. 

Liquidity 

We closely monitor
our liquidity and our liquid assets in the form of cash, due from banks, federal funds sold, and unpledged available-for-sale securities. 

As of September 30,
2024, all of our investment securities were classified as available-for-sale. These investments provide a source of liquidity in the
amount of 50.0 million, which is net of the 38.5 million of securities pledged as collateral. Investment securities available-for-sale
serve as a source of liquidity and interest rate risk management while generally yielding a higher return versus other short-term investment
options, such as federal funds sold and overnight deposits with the Federal Reserve Bank. Due to the unrealized loss on securities available-for-sale,
the sale of investments, other than shorter-term investments with minimal unrealized losses or more recently purchased investments, would
not be considered a primary source of liquidity due to the immediate impact on regulatory capital; however, the majority of the portfolio
is considered high credit quality investments and would be available to pledge against borrowings. 

Our loan to deposit
ratio was 84.65 and 89.06 as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Generally, our policy has been to manage this
ratio at or below 90.00 . 

Available third-party
sources of liquidity as of September 30, 2024 include the following: a line of credit with the FHLB, access to brokered certificates
of deposit markets and the discount window at the Federal Reserve Bank. We also have the ability to borrow 30.0 million in unsecured
federal funds through credit facilities extended by correspondent banks. 

32 

We have used our
line of credit with FHLB to issue letters of credit totaling 12.0 million to the Treasury Board of Virginia for collateral on public
funds. No draws on these letters of credit have been issued. The letters of credit are considered to be draws on our FHLB line of credit.
In July 2024, we increased our letters of credit to 14.0 million. In May 2023, we borrowed 10.0 million from FHLB, through a fixed
rate 5-year advance, to support loan fundings and other general liquidity needs. An additional 190.7 million was available as of September
30, 2024 on the 212.7 million line of credit, of which 95.5 million is secured by a blanket lien on our residential real estate loans.
Full use of the FHLB borrowing capacity would require the Company to pledge additional assets. In December 2023 we borrowed 10.0 million
through the Federal Reserve Bank Bank Term Funding Program for one year, which was repaid using available liquid funds on October 1,
2024 without penalty. 

As of September 30,
2024 total deposits included 3.0 million of brokered time deposits, acquired during the first quarter of 2024 to augment our balance
sheet liquidity. We held no brokered deposits as of December 31, 2023. Internet accounts are limited to customers located in our primary
market area and the surrounding geographical area. The average balance of and the rate paid on deposits is shown in the net interest
margin analysis tables. Total reciprocal Certificate of Deposit Registry Services CDARS time deposits were 7.2 million
and 6.3 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Aside from the availability of CDARS time deposits, we
also offer a similar deposit product for transaction account customers through Intrafi Cash Service ICS ). As of September
30, 2024 approximately 26.4 million were placed in this product as compared to 20.5 million at December 31, 2023. Both the CDARS and
ICS offerings assist us in maintaining deposit relationships, while assuring the depositors funds retain federal deposit insurance
coverage. 

Additional liquidity
is available through the Federal Reserve Bank discount window for overnight funding needs. We may collateralize this line with investment
securities and loans at our discretion; however, while we do not anticipate using this as a primary funding source, securities with an
estimated market value of 21.4 million were pledged as of September 30, 2024. 

Time deposits of
 250,000 or more were approximately 7.22 of total deposits at September 30, 2024 and 7.36 of total deposits at December 31, 2023. 

With the on-balance
sheet liquidity and other external sources of funding, we believe the Bank has adequate liquidity and capital resources to meet our requirements
and needs for the foreseeable future. However, liquidity can be further affected by a number of factors such as counterparty willingness
or ability to extend credit, regulatory actions and customer preferences, etc., some of which are beyond our control. 

The bank holding
company has approximately 20,000 in cash on deposit at the Bank at September 30, 2024. The holding company receives periodic dividend
payments from the Bank which are used to pay operating expenses, to pay trust preferred interest payments and discretionary principal
payments, to fund dividend payments to shareholders and to repurchase shares. The Company makes quarterly interest payments on the trust
preferred securities. 

As discussed in the
Capital Resources section, the Company is authorized to repurchase up to 500,000 shares of the Company s outstanding common stock
through March 31, 2025. Payments for any repurchases will be distributed from available funds, or from dividend payments from the Bank,
and are not expected to have a material impact on available liquidity. 

Off Balance Sheet Items and Contractual
Obligations 

There have been no
material changes during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, to the off-balance sheet items and the contractual obligations disclosed
in our 2023 Form 10-K. 

Item 3. Quantitative
 and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 

Not Applicable. 

Item 4. Controls
 and Procedures 

We have carried
out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our President and Chief Executive
Officer (our CEO) and our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer (our CFO), of the effectiveness of our disclosure
controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the
Exchange Act)) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon that evaluation, our CEO and CFO concluded that our
disclosure controls and procedures were operating effectively in providing reasonable assurance that (a) the information required to
be disclosed by us in the reports that
we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities
and Exchange Commission s rules and forms, and (b) such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including
our CEO and CFO, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
