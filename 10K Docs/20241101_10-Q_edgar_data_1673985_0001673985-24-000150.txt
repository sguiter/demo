ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

The following discussion and analysis of the Company s financial condition and results of operations, which we refer to as our MD A, should be read in conjunction with the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and the notes thereto contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (this "Form 10-Q"), as well as the MD A section included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC on February 16, 2024 (the 2023 Form 10-K ). Certain information contained in the discussion and analysis set forth below includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results and the timing of events may differ materially from those contained in these forward-looking statements due to a number of factors that can affect our performance in both the near- and long-term, including those incorporated by reference in Item 1A of Part II of this Form 10-Q as such factors may be revised or supplemented in subsequent filings with the SEC, as well as those discussed in the section entitled Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements below. 
 
 Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements 
 
 All statements other than statements of historical fact included in this Form 10-Q including, without limitation, statements in this MD A regarding our financial position, business strategy and the plans and objectives of management for future operations, are forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ). When used in this Form 10-Q, words such as "expect," anticipate, "estimate," "outlook," "project," "strategy," "intend," "plan," "target," "goal," "may," "will," "should," and believe, and other variations or similar terminology and expressions identify forward-looking statements. Although we believe forward-looking statements are based upon reasonable assumptions, such statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, many of which are beyond our control and difficult to predict, which may cause the actual results or performance of the Company to be materially different from any future results or performance expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Such risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to: general economic and financial conditions in the U.S. and globally; the potential effects of inflationary pressures, labor market shortages and supply chain issues; instability or volatility in financial markets or other unfavorable economic or business conditions caused by geopolitical concerns, including as a result of the political and policy uncertainties with the approaching U.S. Presidential election, and the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, the conflict in Israel and Gaza and the possible expansion of such conflicts; the effect of any of the foregoing on our customers demand for our products and our suppliers ability to manufacture and deliver our raw materials, including implications of reduced refinery utilization in the U.S.; our ability to sell and provide our goods and services; the ability of our customers to pay for our products; any closures of our and our customers offices and facilities; risks associated with increased phishing, compromised business emails and other cybersecurity attacks, data privacy incidents and disruptions to our technology infrastructure; risks associated with operating with a reduced workforce; risks associated with our indebtedness including compliance with financial and restrictive covenants, and our ability to access capital on reasonable terms, at a reasonable cost, or at all, due to economic conditions or otherwise; the impact of scheduled turnarounds and significant unplanned downtime and interruptions of production or logistics operations as a result of mechanical issues or other unanticipated events such as fires, severe weather conditions, natural disasters, pandemics and, geopolitical conflicts and related events; price fluctuations, cost increases and supply of raw materials; our operations and growth projects requiring substantial capital; growth rates and cyclicality of the industries we serve including global changes in supply and demand; failure to develop and commercialize new products or technologies; loss of significant customer relationships; adverse trade and tax policies; extensive environmental, health and safety laws that apply to our operations; hazards associated with chemical manufacturing, storage and transportation; litigation associated with chemical manufacturing and our business operations generally; inability to acquire and integrate businesses, assets, products or technologies; protection of our intellectual property and proprietary information; prolonged work stoppages as a result of labor difficulties or otherwise; failure to maintain effective internal controls; our ability to declare and pay quarterly cash dividends and the amounts and timing of any future dividends; our ability to repurchase our common stock and the amount and timing of any future repurchases; disruptions in supply chain, transportation and logistics; potential for uncertainty regarding qualification for tax treatment of our spin-off; fluctuations in our stock price; and changes in laws or regulations applicable to our business. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and actual results could differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements as a result of a number of risks, uncertainties and other factors including those noted above and those detailed in Item 1A of Part I and elsewhere in our 2023 Form 10-K, and subsequent reports filed with the SEC. All subsequent written or oral forward-looking statements attributable to us or persons acting on our behalf are qualified in their entirety by this paragraph. We do not undertake to update or revise any of our forward-looking statements. 

Business Overview 
 
 AdvanSix is a diversified chemistry company playing a critical role in global supply chains, innovating and delivering essential products for our customers in a wide variety of end markets and applications that touch people s lives, such as building and construction, fertilizers, agrochemicals, plastics, solvents, packaging, paints, coatings, adhesives and electronics. Our reliable 
 16 

and sustainable supply of quality products emerges from the integrated value chain of our five U.S.-based manufacturing facilities. AdvanSix strives to deliver best-in-class customer experiences and differentiated products in the industries of nylon solutions, plant nutrients and chemical intermediates, guided by our core values of Safety, Integrity, Accountability and Respect. Our four key product lines are as follows: 
 
 Nylon Solutions 
 Nylon We sell our Nylon 6 resin globally, primarily under the Aegis brand name. Nylon 6 is a polymer resin which is a synthetic material used by our customers to produce fibers, filaments, engineered plastics and films that, in turn, are used in such end-products as carpets, automotive and electric components, sports apparel, food packaging and other industrial applications. 
 
 Caprolactam Caprolactam is the key monomer used in the production of Nylon 6 resin. We internally polymerize caprolactam into Aegis Nylon 6 Resins, and we also market and sell the caprolactam that is not consumed internally to customers who use it to manufacture polymer resins to produce fibers, compounds and other nylon products. Our Hopewell, VA manufacturing facility is one of the world s largest single-site producers of caprolactam as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 Ammonium Sulfate Our ammonium sulfate is used by customers as a fertilizer containing nitrogen and sulfur, two key plant nutrients. Ammonium sulfate fertilizer is derived from the integrated operations at the Hopewell manufacturing facility. Because of our Hopewell facility s size, scale and technology design, we are the world s largest single-site producer of ammonium sulfate fertilizer as of September 30, 2024. We market and sell ammonium sulfate primarily to North American and South American distributors, farm cooperatives and retailers to fertilize crops. 
 
 Chemical Intermediates We manufacture, market and sell a number of other chemical intermediate products that are derived from the manufacturing processes within our integrated supply chain. Most significant is acetone which is used by our customers in the production of adhesives, paints, coatings, solvents, herbicides and engineered plastic resins. Other intermediate chemicals that we manufacture, market and sell include phenol, alpha-methylstyrene AMS ), cyclohexanone, 2-pentanone oxime, cyclohexanol, sulfuric acid, ammonia and carbon dioxide. With the acquisition of U.S. Amines Limited U.S. Amines ), we now produce alkyl and specialty amines serving high-value end markets such as agrochemicals and pharmaceuticals. 
 
 Global demand for Nylon 6 resin spans a variety of end-uses such as textiles, engineered plastics, industrial filament, food and industrial films, and carpet. The market growth typically tracks global GDP growth over the long-term but varies by end-use. We produce and sell caprolactam as a commodity product and produce and sell our Nylon 6 resin as both a commoditized and differentiated resin product. Our results of operations are primarily driven by production volume and the spread between the sales prices of our products and the costs of the underlying raw materials built into market-based and value-based pricing models. The global prices for nylon resin typically track a spread over the price of caprolactam, which in turn tracks as a spread over benzene because the key feedstock materials for caprolactam, phenol or cyclohexane, are derived from benzene. This price spread has historically experienced cyclicality as a result of global changes in supply and demand. Generally, Nylon 6 resin prices track the cyclicality of caprolactam prices, although prices set above the spread are achievable when nylon resin manufacturers, like AdvanSix, formulate and produce differentiated nylon resin products for current and new customer applications, such as our wire and cable and co-polymer offerings. 
 
 Global prices for ammonium sulfate fertilizer are influenced by several factors including the price of urea, which sets the nutrient value for nitrogen as it is the most widely used source of nitrogen-based fertilizer in the world. Other global factors driving ammonium sulfate fertilizer demand are general agriculture trends, including planted acres and the price of crops. Our ammonium sulfate product is positioned with the added value proposition of sulfur nutrition to increase yields of key crops. In addition, due to its nutrient density, the typical ammonium sulfate product delivers pound for pound the most readily available sulfur and nitrogen to crops as compared to other fertilizers. We also directly supply packaged ammonium sulfate to customers, primarily in North and South America, and have diversified and optimized our offerings to include spray-grade adjuvants to support crop protection, as well as other specialty fertilizers and products for industrial use. 
 
 We produce ammonium sulfate fertilizer continuously throughout the year as part of our manufacturing process, but quarterly sales fluctuate reflecting both geographical and product sales mix considerations based on the timing and length of the growing seasons in North and South America. North American ammonium sulfate demand and pricing, particularly for our higher-value granular product, are typically strongest during second quarter fertilizer application and then typically decline seasonally with new season fill in the third quarter. Ammonium sulfate industry prices in the corn belt have declined approximately 10 from the second quarter to the third quarter, on average, since 2016. Due to the ammonium sulfate fertilizer sales cycle, we occasionally build up higher inventory balances because our production is continuous and not tied to seasonal demand for fertilizers. Sales of most of our other products have generally been subject to minimal, or no, seasonality. 
 17 

We also manufacture, market and sell a number of chemical intermediate products that are derived from the manufacturing processes within our integrated supply chain. Most significant is acetone, the price of which is influenced by its own supply and demand dynamics but can also be influenced by the underlying move in propylene input costs. Our differentiated product offerings include high-purity applications and high-value intermediates including our U.S. Amines portfolio as well as our oximes-based EZ-Blox anti-skinning agent used in paints and Nadone cyclohexanone, which is a solvent used in various high-value applications. 
 
 We seek to run our production facilities on a nearly continuous basis for maximum efficiency as several of our intermediate products are key feedstock materials for other products in our integrated manufacturing chain. While our integration, scale and range of product offerings make us one of the most efficient manufacturers in our industry, these attributes also expose us to increased risk associated with material disruptions at any one of our production facilities or logistics operations which could impact the overall manufacturing supply chain. Further, although we believe that our sources of supply for our raw materials, including cumene, natural gas and sulfur, are generally robust, it is difficult to predict the impact that shortages, increased costs and related supply chain logistics considerations may have in the future. In order to mitigate the risk of unplanned interruptions, we schedule several planned plant turnarounds each year to conduct routine and major maintenance across our facilities. We also utilize maintenance excellence and mechanical integrity programs, targeted buffer inventory of intermediate chemicals necessary for our manufacturing process, and co-producer swap arrangements, which are intended to mitigate the extent of any production losses as a result of planned and unplanned downtime; however, the mitigation of all or part of any such production impact cannot be assured. 

Recent Developments 
 
 Business Operations 
 
 In October 2024, additional required maintenance at our Hopewell, VA manufacturing site resulted in a delayed ramp to full operating rates following our multi-site planned plant turnaround. The Company expects an incremental approximately 17 million unfavorable impact to pre-tax income in the fourth quarter 2024, inclusive of 10 million related to fixed cost absorption and higher maintenance expense, and 7 million of lost sales. The unplanned interruption did not have any impact on the third quarter 2024 financial results. 
 
 In January 2024, the Company experienced a process-based operational disruption at its Frankford, Pennsylvania manufacturing site temporarily reducing phenol and acetone production at the facility, as well as production at its Hopewell and Chesterfield, Virginia facilities. As a result of a delayed ramp to targeted utilization rates, the Company recognized an unfavorable impact to pre-tax income in the first quarter 2024 of approximately 27 million, comprised of the impact of lost sales and other additional costs including purchases of replacement product and incremental plant spend. The Company returned to targeted utilization rates at its Frankford, Pennsylvania manufacturing site, as well as across its value chain, prior to the end of the first quarter of 2024. 
 
 Chesterfield, VA Collective Bargaining Agreement 
 
 On May 9, 2024, the Company s Chesterfield bargaining unit, represented by the Teamsters Local 592, ratified a new five-year labor agreement in advance of the prior agreement s expiration date of May 14, 2024. The ratified labor agreement affected approximately 160 workers at the Company s manufacturing facility in Chesterfield, Virginia. 
 
 Succession of Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer 
 
 Michael Preston retired as the Company's Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, effective as of October 1, 2024, but will remain at the Company through year-end 2024 to help facilitate the transition of his responsibilities to his successor. Effective as of October 1, 2024, the Board of Directors has appointed Siddharth Manjeshwar as Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer to succeed Mr. Preston.

 Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by 1.6 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year period due to increased incentive-based compensation expense and enterprise resource planning system expense partially offset by lower bad debt expense and moderated functional support costs. 

Income Tax Expense 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Income tax expense (benefit) 7,479 (2,076) 14,603 17,753 Effective tax rate 25.1 20.7 25.0 22.9 
 
 The Company s provision (benefit) for income taxes in interim periods is computed by applying an estimated annual effective tax rate against Income before taxes for the period in addition to recording any tax effects of discrete items for the quarter. The Company s effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 differed from the U.S. federal statutory rate, due primarily to the impacts of state taxes and executive compensation deduction limitations, offset by tax credits and the foreign-derived intangible income deduction. In 2024, the Company recorded discrete tax adjustments related to the vesting of equity compensation, changes to state tax legislation, and return to provision adjustments related to the filing of the Company's 2023 U.S. federal income tax return which resulted in a net 3.3 increase to the quarterly effective tax rate and a net 1.5 increase to the year-to-date effective tax rate. Additionally for 2023, discrete tax adjustments relating to the vesting of equity compensation, changes in state tax legislation, and return to provision adjustments related to the filing of the Company's 2022 U.S. federal income tax return resulted in a net 4.4 increase to the quarterly effective tax rate and a net 1.6 decrease to the year-to-date effective tax rate. 
 
 The Company's effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was higher than the prior year period due primarily to the Loss before taxes recorded in the prior year period and a related reduction in the foreign-derived intangible income benefit that collectively reduced the 2023 quarterly rate by approximately 6 . The Company's effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was higher than the prior year period due primarily to the impacts of discrete adjustments in each respective period, which represented a net increase in the quarterly rate of approximately 3.1 as compared to the prior year period. This increase in the effective tax rate was attributable to the return to provision adjustments related to the filing of the Company's U.S. federal income tax returns and a reduction in the benefit associated with vesting of equity compensation, net of a decrease in effective tax rate associated with state legislation enacted during the period ended September 30, 2024. 

Net Income

Non-GAAP Measures 
 (Dollars in thousands, unless otherwise noted) 
 
 The following tables set forth the non-GAAP financial measures of Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, Adjusted Net income and Adjusted Earnings Per Share. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as Net income before Interest, Income taxes, Depreciation and amortization, Non-cash stock-based compensation, Non-recurring, unusual or extraordinary expenses, Non-cash amortization from acquisitions and One-time merger and acquisition costs. Adjusted EBITDA Margin is equal to Adjusted EBITDA divided by Sales. The Company believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information as they are used by the Company s management to evaluate the Company s operating performance, enhance a reader s understanding of the financial performance of the Company, and facilitate a better comparison among fiscal periods and performance relative to its competitors, as the non-GAAP measures exclude items that management believes do not reflect the Company s ongoing operations. 
 
 These non-GAAP results are presented for supplemental informational purposes only and should not be considered a substitute for the financial information presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures should be read only in conjunction with the comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures. The Company's non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to other companies' non-GAAP measures. 
 
 The following is a reconciliation between the non-GAAP financial measures of Adjusted Net income, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin to their most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure:

 2024 includes a pre-tax loss of approximately 1.2 million from the reduction of the Company's anticipated receivable related to the gain on the termination fee recorded upon the exit from the Oben Holding Group S.A. alliance during the third quarter of 2023. During 2023, there were several transactions including the exit from the Oben Holding Group S.A. alliance, licensee exit of legacy technology and exit of certain low-margin oximes products that resulted in a 4.5 million net pre-tax loss. 
 Adjusted EBITDA Margin is defined as Adjusted EBITDA divided by Sales

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 (Dollars in thousands, unless otherwise noted) 
 
 Liquidity 
 
 We believe that cash balances and operating cash flows, together with available capacity under our credit agreement, as utilized in the third quarter of 2024, will provide adequate funds to support our current short-term operating objectives as well as our longer-term strategic plans, subject to the risks and uncertainties outlined below, in our "Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements" above, and in the risk factors previously disclosed in Item 1A of Part I of our 2023 Form 10-K. Our principal source of liquidity is our cash flow generated from operating activities, which is expected to provide us with the ability to meet the majority of our short-term funding requirements. Our cash flows are affected by capital requirements and production volume, which may be materially impacted by unanticipated events such as unplanned downtime, material disruptions at our production facilities, the prices of our raw materials, general economic and industry trends and customer demand. The Company applies a proactive and disciplined approach to working capital management to optimize cash flow and to enable capital allocation options in support of the Company s strategy. We utilize supply chain financing and trade receivables discount arrangements with third-party financial institutions which optimize terms and conditions related to accounts receivable and accounts payable in order to enhance liquidity and enable us to efficiently manage our working capital needs. Although we continue to optimize supply chain financing and trade receivable programs in the ordinary course, our utilization of these arrangements has not had a material impact on our liquidity. In addition, we monitor the third-party depository institutions that hold our cash and cash equivalents. Our emphasis is primarily on the safety of principal and secondarily on maximizing yield on those funds. We diversify our cash and cash equivalents among counterparties to minimize exposure to any one of these entities. 
 
 On a recurring basis, our primary future cash needs will be centered on operating activities, working capital, capital expenditures, dividends and liquidity reflecting disciplined capital deployment. Capital expenditures are deployed for various ongoing investments and initiatives to improve reliability, yield and quality, expand production capacity and comply with health, safety and environmental ("HSE") regulations. We believe that our future cash from operations, cash on hand and available capacity under our credit agreement, as well as our access to credit and capital markets, will provide adequate resources to fund our expected operating and financing needs and obligations. Our ability to fund our capital needs, however, will depend on our ongoing ability to generate cash from operations and access to credit and capital markets, both of which are subject to the risk factors previously disclosed in Item 1A of Part I of our 2023 Form 10-K, as well as general economic, financial, competitive, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control. 
 
 As of the end of the third quarter of 2024, the Company had approximately 17.3 million of cash on hand with approximately 284 million of additional capacity available under the revolving credit facility. The Company s Consolidated Leverage Ratio financial covenant of its credit facility allows it to net up to 75 million of cash with debt. Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately 135 million to 140 million in 2024 compared to 107 million in 2023, reflecting refined execution timing 
 22 

to address critical enterprise risk mitigation and growth projects including our SUSTAIN (Sustainable U.S. Sulfate to Accelerate Increased Nutrition) program. 
 
 We assumed from Honeywell International Inc. ("Honeywell") all HSE liabilities and compliance obligations related to the past and future operations of our current business as of the spin-off, as well as all HSE liabilities associated with the three manufacturing locations assumed from Honeywell that are used in our current operations, including any cleanup or other liabilities related to any contamination that may have occurred at such locations in the past. Honeywell retained all HSE liabilities related to former business locations or the operation of our former businesses. Although we have ongoing environmental remedial obligations at certain of our facilities, in the past three years, the associated remediation costs have not been material, and we do not expect our known remediation costs to have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated financial position or results of operations. 
 
 We expect that our primary cash requirements for 2024 will be to fund costs associated with ongoing operations, capital expenditures, and amounts related to other contractual obligations. 
 
 The Company made no cash contributions to the defined benefit pension plan during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and does not expect to make cash contributions during the fourth quarter of 2024. Additional contributions may be made in future years sufficient to satisfy pension funding requirements in those periods. 
 
 The Company's Board of Directors (the "Board") has authorized share repurchase programs to repurchase shares of the Company's common stock as follows: 
 
 Date of Authorization Authorized Amount 
 (millions) 
 Authorized Amount Remaining as of September 30, 2024 
 (millions) 
 May 4, 2018 75.0 February 22, 2019 75.0 February 17, 2023 75.0 62.0 Totals 225.0 62.0 
 
 Repurchases may be made from time to time on the open market in accordance with Rule 10b-18 of the Exchange Act, including through the use of trading plans intended to qualify under Rule 10b5-1 of the Exchange Act. The size and timing of these repurchases will depend on pricing, market and economic conditions, legal and contractual requirements and other factors. The share repurchase program has no expiration date and may be modified, suspended or discontinued at any time. The par value of the shares repurchased is applied to Treasury stock and the excess of the purchase price over par value is applied to Additional paid-in capital. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company has repurchased a total of 6,252,129 shares of common stock life-to-date, including 1,006,673 shares withheld to cover tax withholding obligations in connection with the vesting of awards, for an aggregate of 192.4 million at a weighted average market price of 30.78 per share. As of September 30, 2024, 62.0 million remained available for share repurchases under the current authorization. During the period October 1, 2024 through October 25, 2024, no additional shares were repurchased for tax withholding obligations or under the currently authorized repurchase program. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as described in Instruction 8 to Item 303(b) of Regulation S-K and did not have any material changes in the commitments or contractual obligations detailed in the Company's 2023 Form 10-K (see Part II, Item 7 "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" under "Liquidity and Capital Resources - Liquidity"). The Company has not guaranteed any debt or commitments of other entities or entered into any options on non-financial assets. 
 
 Dividends 
 
 The Company commenced the declaration of dividends on September 28, 2021. 
 
 Dividends announced during 2024 are as follows:

 The timing, declaration, amount and payment of future dividends to stockholders, if any, will fall within the discretion of our Board. Holders of shares of our common stock will be entitled to receive dividends when, and if, declared by our Board at its discretion out of funds legally available for that purpose, subject to the terms of our indebtedness, the preferential rights of any preferred stock that may be outstanding, legal requirements, regulatory constraints, industry practice and other factors that our Board deems relevant. 

Credit Agreement 
 
 On September 30, 2016, the Company as the borrower, entered into a Credit Agreement with Bank of America, as administrative agent (the "Original Credit Agreement"), which was amended on February 21, 2018 (the "First Amended and Restated Credit Agreement"), and further amended on February 19, 2020 (the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement ). The Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement had a five-year term with a scheduled maturity date of February 21, 2023. 
 
 On October 27, 2021, the Company completed a refinancing of the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement by entering into a new Credit Agreement (the Credit Agreement ), among the Company, the lenders party thereto, the swing line lenders party thereto, the letter of credit issuers party thereto and Truist Bank, as administrative agent, which provides for a new senior secured revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of 500 million (the Revolving Credit Facility ). 
 
 Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility are subject to customary borrowing conditions. 
 
 The Revolving Credit Facility has a scheduled maturity date of October 27, 2026. The Credit Agreement permits the Company to utilize up to 40 million of the Revolving Credit Facility for the issuance of letters of credit and up to 40 million for swing line loans. The Company has the option to establish a new class of term loans and/or increase the amount of the Revolving Credit Facility in an aggregate principal amount for all such incremental term loans and increases of the Revolving Credit Facility of up to the sum of (x) 175 million plus (y) an amount such that the Company s Consolidated First Lien Secured Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement) would not be greater than 2.75 to 1.00, in each case, to the extent that any one or more lenders, whether or not currently party to the Credit Agreement, commits to be a lender for such amount or any portion thereof. 
 
 With the cessation of LIBOR on June 30, 2023 and subject to the First Amendment to the Credit Agreement, dated as of June 27, 2023, the Eurodollar Rate was replaced with the Adjusted Term SOFR as an alternative benchmark rate for purposes of the Credit Agreement. The transition was effective July 1, 2023. Borrowings under the Credit Agreement bear interest at a rate equal to either the sum of a base rate plus a margin ranging from 0.25 to 1.25 or the sum of an Adjusted Term SOFR rate plus a margin ranging from 1.25 to 2.25 , with either such margin varying according to the Company s Consolidated Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement). The Company is also required to pay a commitment fee in respect of unused commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility, if any, at a rate ranging from 0.15 to 0.35 per annum depending on the Company s Consolidated Leverage Ratio. In conjunction with the cessation of LIBOR, as of July 1, 2023, the applicable margin under the Credit Agreement was 0.25 for base rate loans and 1.25 for Adjusted Term SOFR loans and the applicable commitment fee rate was 0.15 per annum. 
 
 Substantially all tangible and intangible assets of the Company and its domestic subsidiaries are pledged as collateral to secure the Company's obligations under the Credit Agreement. 
 
 The Credit Agreement contains customary covenants limiting the ability of the Company and its subsidiaries to, among other things, pay cash dividends, incur debt or liens, redeem or repurchase stock of the Company, enter into transactions with affiliates, make investments, make capital expenditures, merge or consolidate with others or dispose of assets. The Credit Agreement also contains financial covenants that require the Company to maintain a Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement) of not less than 3.00 to 1.00 and to maintain a Consolidated Leverage Ratio of (i) 4.00 to 1.00 or less for the fiscal quarter ending December 31, 2021, through and including the fiscal quarter ending September 30, 2023 and 
 24 

(ii) 3.75 to 1.00 or less for each fiscal quarter thereafter (subject to the Company s option to elect a consolidated leverage ratio increase in connection with certain acquisitions). If the Company does not comply with the covenants in the Credit Agreement, the lenders may, subject to customary cure rights, require the immediate payment of all amounts outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility. We were in compliance with all of our covenants at September 30, 2024 and through the date of the filing of this Form 10-Q. 
 
 We had a borrowed balance of 170 million under the Revolving Credit Facility at December 31, 2023. We borrowed an incremental net amount of 45 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, bringing the balance under the Revolving Credit Facility to 215 million, and available credit for use of approximately 284 million as of September 30, 2024. We expect that Cash provided by operating activities will fund future interest payments on the Company's outstanding indebtedness. 

Cash Flow Summary 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Cash provided by (used for): Operating activities 71,248 57,381 Investing activities (105,426) (71,429) Financing activities 21,708 5,173 Net change in cash and cash equivalents (12,470) (8,875) 
 
 Cash provided by operating activities increased by 13.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 versus the prior year period due primarily to (i) an 18.8 million favorable cash impact from accrued liabilities due primarily to the timing of payments and accruals during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 related to incentive-based compensation and other accrued liabilities compared to the prior year period and (ii) a 9.7 million favorable cash impact from working capital (comprised of Accounts and other receivables, Inventories, Accounts payable and Deferred income and customer advances) with a 44.4 million unfavorable cash impact from working capital for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to a 54.0 million unfavorable cash impact in the prior year period due primarily to the favorable impact of Deferred income and customer advances, Inventory and Accounts payable partially offset by Accounts and other receivables. These net favorable impacts were partially offset by a 15.9 million decrease in Net income. 
 
 Cash used for investing activities increased by 34.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 versus the prior year period due primarily to higher cash payments for capital expenditures of approximately 30.3 million during the current year period primarily reflecting increased spend on replacement maintenance and enterprise programs. 
 
 Cash provided by financing activities increased by 16.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 versus the prior year period due primarily to net borrowings of 45.0 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to net borrowings of 55.0 million during the prior year period, partially offset by payments for share repurchases of 10.4 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 37.7 million during the prior year period. Cash paid for dividends was relatively unchanged year-over-year. 
 
 Capital Expenditures 
 (Dollars in thousands, unless otherwise noted) 
 
 Our operations are capital intensive, requiring ongoing investments that have consisted, and are expected to continue to consist, primarily of capital expenditures required to maintain and improve equipment reliability, expand production output, further improve mix, yield and cost position, and comply with environmental and safety regulations. 
 
 The following table summarizes ongoing and expansion capital expenditures: 
 25 

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Capital expenditures in Accounts payable at December 31, 2023 
 22,660 Purchases of property, plant and equipment 91,731 Less: Capital expenditures in Accounts payable at September 30, 2024 
 (15,018) Cash paid for capital expenditures 99,373 
 
 For 2024, we expect our total capital expenditures to be approximately 135 million to 140 million compared to 107 million in 2023, reflecting refined execution timing to address critical enterprise risk mitigation and growth projects including our SUSTAIN (Sustainable U.S. Sulfate to Accelerate Increased Nutrition) program. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 
 The preparation of our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP is based on the selection and application of accounting policies that require us to make significant estimates and assumptions about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. We consider these accounting policies to be critical to the understanding of our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. For a full description of our critical accounting policies, refer to Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contained in our 2023 Form 10-K. While there have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies, or the methodologies or assumptions we apply under them since the filing of the 2023 Form 10-K, we continue to monitor such methodologies and assumptions. 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
 
 See Note 2. Recent Accounting Pronouncements to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I. Item 1 of this Form 10-Q. 

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 
 Our exposure to risk based on changes in interest rates during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 relates primarily to the Revolving Credit Facility. The Revolving Credit Facility bears interest at floating rates. For variable rate debt, interest rate changes generally do not affect the fair market value of such debt assuming all other factors remain constant but do impact future earnings and cash flows. Accordingly, we may be exposed to interest rate risk on borrowings under the Credit Agreement. 
 
 Based on current borrowing levels at September 30, 2024, a 25-basis point fluctuation in interest rates for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 would have resulted in an increase or decrease to our interest expense of approximately 0.5 million. 
 
 See Note 12. Derivative and Hedging Instruments to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 for a discussion relating to credit and market, commodity price and interest rate risk management. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. 
 
 Management recognizes that any disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives. Because there are inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud have been, or will be, detected. 
 26 

Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, with the assistance of other members of our management, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report. Based upon such evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective at a reasonable assurance level as of September 30, 2024, the end of the period covered by this quarterly report. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 Management has not identified any change in the Company's internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting. 

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
 
 From time to time, we are involved in litigation relating to claims arising outside of the ordinary course of our business operations. We are not a party to, and, to our knowledge, there are no pending claims or actions against us, the ultimate disposition of which could be expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or operating cash flows. 

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 
 
 There have been no material changes to our risk factors as previously disclosed in Item 1A of Part I of the Company s 2023 Form 10-K, which are hereby incorporated by reference.
