CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

This Quarterly Report on Form
10-Q (this Quarterly Report contains forward-looking statements regarding, among other things, our plans, strategies and
prospects, both business and financial. These statements are based on the beliefs and assumptions of our management. Although we believe
that our plans, intentions and expectations reflected in or suggested by these forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot provide
assurance that we will achieve or realize these plans, intentions or expectations. Forward-looking statements are inherently subject to
risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Generally, statements that are not historical facts, including statements concerning possible or
assumed future actions, business strategies, events or results of operations, are forward-looking statements. The words anticipate, 
 believe, continue, could, estimate, expect, intend, 
 may, might, plan, possible, potential, predict, project, 
 should, would and similar expressions may identify forward-looking statements, but the absence of these words
does not mean that a statement is not forward-looking. Investors should read statements that contain these words carefully because they
discuss future expectations, contain projects of future results of operations or financial condition; or state other forward-looking 
information. Forward-looking statements are based on information available as of the date of this Quarterly Report and may involve significant
judgments and assumptions, known and unknown risks and uncertainties and other factors, many of which are outside our control. There may
be events in the future that management is not able to predict accurately or over which we have no control. We do not undertake any obligation
to update to otherwise correct any forward-looking statements contained herein to reflect events or circumstances after the date they
were made, whether as a result of new information, future events, inaccuracies that become apparent after the date hereof or otherwise,
except as may be required under applicable laws. The risk factors and cautionary language contained in this Quarterly Report provide examples
of risks, uncertainties, and events that may cause actual results to differ materially from the expectations described in such forward-looking
statements, including among other things: 

our ability to grow and manage future growth profitably over time, maintain relationships with customers,
compete within our industry and retain key employees; 

the possibility that we may be adversely impacted by economic, business, and/or competitive factors; 

our limited operating history makes it difficult to evaluate our business and prospects; 

our recent and rapid growth may not be indicative of future performance; 

we may not continue to grow or maintain our active user base, and we may not be able to achieve or maintain
profitability; 

risks relating to our ability to attract new advertisers, or the potential loss of existing advertisers
or the reduction of or failure by existing advertisers to maintain or increase their advertising budgets; 

Rumble Cloud, our recently launched cloud business may not achieve success, and, as a result, our business,
financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected; 

negative media campaigns may adversely impact our financial performance, results of operations, and relationships
with our business partners, including content creators and advertisers; 

spam activity, including inauthentic and fraudulent user activity, if undetected, may contribute to some
amount of overstatement of our performance indicators, including reporting of MAUs by Google; 

we collect, store, and process large amounts of user video content and personal information of our users
and subscribers. If our security measures are breached, our sites and applications may be perceived as not being secure, traffic and advertisers
may curtail or stop viewing our content or using our services, our business and operating results could be harmed, and we could face governmental
investigations and legal claims from users and subscribers; 

we may fail to comply with applicable privacy laws; 

ii 

we are subject to cybersecurity risks and interruptions or failures in our information technology systems
and as we grow and gain recognition, we will likely need to expend additional resources to enhance our protection from such risks. Notwithstanding
our efforts, a cyber incident could occur and result in information theft, data corruption, operational disruption and/or financial loss; 

we may be found to have infringed on the intellectual property of others, which could expose us to substantial
losses or restrict our operations; 

we may face liability for hosting a variety of tortious or unlawful materials uploaded by third parties,
notwithstanding the liability protections of Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act of 1996 Section 230 

we may face negative publicity for removing, or declining to remove, certain content, regardless of whether
such content violated any law; 

paid endorsements by our content creators may expose us to regulatory risk, liability, and compliance
costs, and, as a result, may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations; 

our traffic growth, engagement, and monetization depend upon effective operation within and compatibility
with operating systems, networks, devices, web browsers and standards, including mobile operating systems, networks, and standards that
we do not control; 

our business depends on continued and unimpeded access to our content and services on the internet. If
we or those who engage with our content experience disruptions in internet service, or if internet service providers are able to block,
degrade or charge for access to our content and services, we could incur additional expenses and the loss of traffic and advertisers; 

we face significant market competition, and if we are unable to compete effectively with our competitors
for traffic and advertising spend, our business and operating results could be harmed; 

we rely on data from third parties to calculate certain of our performance metrics. Real or perceived
inaccuracies in such metrics may harm our reputation and negatively affect our business; 

changes to our existing content and services could fail to attract traffic and advertisers or fail to
generate revenue; 

we derive the majority of our revenue from advertising. The failure to attract new advertisers, the loss
of existing advertisers, or the reduction of or failure by existing advertisers to maintain or increase their advertising budgets would
adversely affect our business; 

we depend on third-party vendors, including internet service providers, advertising networks, and data
centers, to provide core services; 

hosting and delivery costs may increase unexpectedly; 

iii 

we have offered and intend to continue to offer incentives, including economic incentives, to content
creators to join our platform, and these arrangements may involve fixed payment obligations that are not contingent on actual revenue
or performance metrics generated by the applicable content creator but rather are based on our modeled financial projections for that
creator, which if not satisfied may adversely impact our financial performance, results of operations and liquidity; 

we may be unable to develop or maintain effective internal controls; 

potential diversion of management s attention and consumption of resources as a result of acquisitions
of other companies and success in integrating and otherwise achieving the benefits of recent and potential acquisitions; 

we may fail to maintain adequate operational and financial resources or raise additional capital or generate
sufficient cash flows; 

changes in tax rates, changes in tax treatment of companies engaged in e-commerce, the adoption of new
tax legislation, or exposure to additional tax liabilities may adversely impact our financial results; 

compliance obligations imposed by new privacy laws, laws regulating social media platforms and online
speech in certain jurisdictions in which we operate, or industry practices may adversely affect our business; and 

other risks and uncertainties indicated in this Quarterly Report and in other filings that we have made
or will make with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC ), including the risk factors described under the caption
 Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

3. Acquisitions (Continued) 

Acquisition of Callin Corp. (Continued) 

shares of Class A Common Stock to the preferred shareholders
and SAFE note holders of Callin. The fair value of the Company s Class A Common Stock on the Acquisition Date was per share.
In addition, the Company issued rights to four payments each consisting of contingently issuable shares of Class A Common Stock
to the common shareholders, series FF preferred shareholders, option holders and continuing employees of Callin contingent on the following
conditions being met: 

Retention
payment 1: Services are provided by a selling shareholder for 12 months; 

Retention
payment 2: Services are provided by a selling shareholder for 24 months; 

Milestone
payment 1: Within 12 months, certain feature development and technical performance criteria are achieved, and the acquired technology
is integrated into the Company s existing software and 

Milestone
payment 2: Within 24 months, certain feature development and technical performance criteria are achieved. 

In assessing what is part of the business
combination, the Company has determined that because the two retention payments are contingent on a selling shareholder providing services
post-combination, the portion of those tranches earned by the party providing services should be reflected in the Company s financial
statements as post-combination expense. In addition, where future services are required by employees in order to earn rights to the contingent
consideration, such rights are being accounted for either entirely as post-combination expense or as replacement awards where the rights
replace unvested options or restricted series FF preferred shares that were originally granted by Callin. Rights to contingent consideration
held by non-accredited investors will be settled in cash at per share. For the remainder, the four tranches of contingently issuable
shares have been accounted for as contingent consideration. 

Share-based compensation (Note 11) 

Total contingently issuable shares 

During the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2024, certain of the contingently issuable shares were issued. Refer to Note 11 for the share-based compensation and below
for the impact on contingent consideration.

3. Acquisitions (Continued) 

Acquisition of Callin Corp. (Continued) 

. 

On May 15, 2024, retention payment
1 was met resulting in the issuance of shares of Class A Common Stock and a cash payment of . Retention payment 2 was
reclassified to equity because the number of shares to be issued if the contingency is met is now fixed. As a result, the Company recognized
 in equity and in accounts payable and accrued liabilities. As of September 30, 2024, retention payment 2 has not been
met. 

The Company has recognized a change
in fair value for the retention payment 1 and 2 contingent consideration of nil and due to the change in the Company s
stock price and the probability of each contingency being met for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. 

Milestone payments 1 and 2 

The Company has determined that milestone
payments 1 and 2 are separate units of account because a fixed number of shares will be issued if each contingency is met, and meeting
one contingency is not dependent on the other. The key inputs into the fair value determination are the probability of each contingency
being met, and the share price on the Acquisition Date. As of September 30, 2024, milestone payments 1 and 2 were met resulting in the
issuance of shares of Class A Common Stock and a cash payment of . 

The acquired goodwill relates to Callin s
workforce and synergies that are expected to be realized upon the integration of Callin s technology with the Rumble platform. Such
synergies will include the ability to leverage the creator relationships that Rumble has secured to date and will allow for a greater
ability to establish brand recognition and monetization of the Callin platform in the future. The goodwill is not expected to be deductible
for tax purposes.

Legal Proceedings 

In the normal course of business, to
facilitate transactions in services and products, the Company indemnifies certain parties. The Company has agreed to hold certain parties
harmless against losses arising from a breach of representations or covenants, or out of intellectual property infringement or other claims
made against certain parties. Several of these agreements limit the time within which an indemnification claim can be made and the amount
of the claim. In addition, the Company has entered into indemnification agreements with its officers and directors, and its bylaws contain
similar indemnification obligations to its agents. 

Furthermore, many of the Company s
agreements with its customers and partners require the Company to indemnify them for certain intellectual property infringement claims
against them, which would increase costs as a result of defending such claims, and may require that we pay significant damages if there
were an adverse ruling in any such claims. Customers and partners may discontinue the use of the Company s services and technologies
as a result of injunctions or otherwise, which could result in loss of revenues and adversely impact the business. 

It is not possible to make a reasonable
estimate of the maximum potential amount under these indemnification agreements due to the unique facts and circumstances involved in
each particular agreement. As of September 30, 2024, there were no material indemnification claims that were probable or reasonably possible. 

As of September 30, 2024, Rumble was
defending a lawsuit against the Company and one of its shareholders seeking a variety of relief including rescission of a share redemption
sale agreement with the Company or damages alleged to be worth million. 

The Company is defending the claims
and considers that the likelihood that it will be required to make a payment to plaintiffs to be remote.

liability was derecognized. One of the contingent payments was settled through the issuance of shares and the remaining contingent payment
was reclassified to equity and accounts payable.

Refer to Note 2, Summary
of Significant Accounting Policies, to the Company s annual consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023 Annual Financial Statements 

Expenses 

Expenses primarily include
cost of services, general and administrative, research and development, sales and marketing, acquisition-related transaction costs, amortization
and depreciation, and changes in fair value of contingent consideration. The most significant component of our expenses on an ongoing
basis are programming and content, service provider costs, and staffing-related costs. 

We expect to continue to invest
substantial resources to support our growth and anticipate that each of the following categories of expenses will increase in absolute
dollar amounts for the foreseeable future. 

26 

Cost of Services (Exclusive of Amortization
and Depreciation) 

Cost of services consists
of costs related to obtaining, supporting and hosting the Company s product offerings. These costs primarily include: 

Programming and content costs related to compensation to content
providers, including share-based compensation, from whom video and other content are licensed. These costs are paid to these providers
based on revenues generated, or in fixed amounts. In certain circumstances, we incur additional costs related to incentivizing top content
creators to promote and join our platform; and 

Other cost of services such as third-party service provider
costs, including data center and networking, as well as payment processing fees and costs paid to publishers. 

General and Administrative Expenses 

General and administrative
expenses consist primarily of payroll and related expenses, which include bonuses and share-based compensation for our executives and
certain other employees. General and administrative expenses also include legal and professional fees, business insurance costs, operating
lease costs and other costs. As a public company, we expect to continue to incur material costs related to compliance with applicable
laws and regulations, including audit and accounting fees, legal, insurance, investor relations and other costs. 

Research and Development Expenses 

Research and development expenses
consist primarily of payroll and related expenses, which include bonuses and share-based compensation for our employees on our engineering
and development teams. Research and development expenses also include consultant fees related to our development activities to originate,
develop and enhance our platforms. 

Sales and Marketing Expenses 

Sales and marketing expenses
consist primarily of payroll and related expenses, which include bonuses and share-based compensation for our employees associated with
our sales and marketing functions. Sales and marketing expenses also include consultant fees and direct marketing costs related to the
promotion of our platforms and solutions. We expect our sales and marketing expenses to increase over time as we promote our platform
and brand, increase marketing activities, and grow domestic and international operations. 

Acquisition-related Transaction Costs 

Acquisition-related transaction
costs consist of transaction expenses related to the Callin acquisition. 

Amortization and Depreciation 

Amortization and depreciation
represent the recognition of costs of assets used in operations, including property and equipment and intangible assets, over their estimated
service lives. 

Change in Fair Value of Contingent Consideration

Certain contingent consideration
associated with the Callin acquisition does not meet the criteria for equity classification, and must be recorded as a liability in accordance
with guidance contained in ASC 815-40, Derivatives and Hedging Contracts in Entity s Own Equity ASC 815-40 ).
Because the contingent consideration meets the definition of a liability under ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging ASC 815 ),
it is measured at fair value at inception and at each reporting date in accordance with the guidance in ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement
 ASC 820 ), with any subsequent changes in fair value recognized in the consolidated statement of operations in the applicable
period of change. 

27 

Non-Operating Income and Other Items 

Interest Income 

Interest income consists of
interest earned on our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. We invest in highly liquid securities such as money market funds,
treasury bills and term deposits. 

Other Income (Expense) 

Other income (expense) consists
of miscellaneous income earned outside of normal company revenue as well as foreign exchange gains and losses related to gains and losses
on transactions denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. 

Change in Fair Value of Warrant Liability 

We account for our outstanding
warrants in accordance with ASC 815-40, under which the warrants issued in connection with Business Combination do not meet the criteria
for equity classification, and must be recorded as liabilities. As these warrants meet the definition of a liability under ASC 815, they
are measured at fair value at inception and at each reporting date in accordance with the guidance in ASC 820, with any subsequent changes
in fair value recognized in the consolidated statement of operations in the applicable period of change. 

Income Tax Benefit (Expense) 

Income tax benefit (expense)
consists of the estimated federal, state, and foreign income taxes incurred in the U.S. and other jurisdictions in which we operate. 

Key Business Metrics 

To analyze our business performance,
determine financial forecasts and help develop long-term strategic plans, we review the key business metrics described below. 

Monthly Active Users MAUs 

We use MAUs as a measure of
audience engagement to help us understand the volume of users engaged with our content on a monthly basis. MAUs represent the total web,
mobile app, and connected TV users of Rumble for each month, which allows us to measure our total user base calculated from data provided
by Google, a third-party analytics provider. Google defines active users as the [n]umber of distinct users who visited
your website or application. 1 We have used the Google
analytics systems since we first began publicly reporting MAU statistics, and the resulting data have not been independently verified. 

As of July 1, 2023, Universal
Analytics UA ), Google s analytics platform on which we historically relied for calculating MAUs using company-set
parameters, was phased out by Google and ceased processing data. At that time, Google Analytics 4 GA4 succeeded UA as
Google s next-generation analytics platform, which has been used to determine MAUs since the third quarter of 2023 and which we
expect to continue to use to determine MAUs in future periods. Although Google has disclosed certain information regarding the transition
to GA4, 2 Google does not currently make available sufficient
information relating to its new GA4 algorithm for us to determine the full effect of the switch from UA to GA4 on our reported MAUs. Because
Google has publicly stated that metrics in UA may be more or less similar to metrics in GA4, and that [i]t is not
unusual for there to be apparent discrepancies between the two systems, 3 
we are unable to determine whether the transition from UA to GA4 has had a positive or negative effect, or the magnitude of such effect,
if any, on our reported MAUs. It is therefore possible that MAUs that we reported based on the UA methodology MAUs (UA) for periods prior to July 1, 2023, cannot be meaningfully compared to MAUs based on the GA4 methodology MAUs (GA4) in
subsequent periods.

Comparing Metrics: Google Analytics 4 vs. Universal Analytics, https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/11986666#zippy= 2Cin-this-article
(last accessed Mar. 15, 2024) [hereinafter: Google, Comparing Metrics. ] (providing the technical criteria Google uses to
calculate active users). 

2 Id . 

3 Id . 

28 

MAUs (GA4) represent the total
web, mobile app, and connected TV users of Rumble for each month, 4 
which allows us to measure our total user base calculated from data provided by Google. 5 
Connected TV users were not counted within MAUs within MAUs (UA) for periods prior to July 1, 2023, and we believe the number of such
users was immaterial in those prior periods. We also believe that fewer than 1 million MAUs in the current period are from connected TV,
making them similarly immaterial. Google s parameters for measuring active users appear to exclude many, but not all,
users who access content on Rumble through embedded videos on domains other than rumble.com, and we are unable to determine
the exact number of users who access embedded content within our total number of MAUs. In addition, MAUs (GA4) may rely
on statistical sampling and may be based on estimates of data that Google is missing due to factors such as cookie consent. 6 

As with our earlier MAU reporting,
there is a potential for minor overlap in the resulting data due to users who access Rumble s content through the web, our mobile
apps, and connected TVs in a given measurement period; however, given that we believe this minor overlap to be immaterial, we do not separately
track or report unique users as distinct from MAUs. Our reported MAUs have not historically included users of Locals, however,
starting in mid-May 2024, Locals users began using Rumble s single sign-on technology to access their account, which we expect will
reduce the number of Locals users not included in our Rumble MAU reporting. We also do not separately report the number of users who register
for accounts in any given period, which is different from MAUs. 

Like many other major social
media companies, we rely on significant paid advertising in order to attract users to our platform; however, we cannot be certain that
all or substantially all activity that results from such advertising is genuine. Spam activity, including inauthentic and fraudulent user
activity, if undetected, may contribute to some amount of overstatement of our performance indicators, including reporting of MAUs by
Google. We continually seek to improve our ability to estimate the total number of spam-generated users, and we eliminate material activity
that is substantially likely to be spam from the calculation of our MAUs. We will not, however, succeed in identifying and removing all
spam. 

MAUs (GA4) were 67 million
on average in the third quarter of 2024, an increase of 26 from the second quarter of 2024. We believe that this increase is attributable
to an increased interest in political news in the third quarter of 2024, including the lead-up to the United States presidential election. 

4 During the measurement period, Rumble was available on the following
connected TV systems: Roku, Android TV, Amazon Fire, LG, and Samsung TVs. 

5 Google provides additional information on its definition of
an active user, see Google, Comparing Metrics. 

6 According to the GA4 dashboard, [a]s of August 26, 2023,
Analytics is estimating data that s missing due to factors such as cookie consent.

Average Revenue Per User ARPU 

We use ARPU as a measure of
our ability to monetize our user base. Quarterly ARPU is calculated as quarterly Audience Monetization revenue divided by MAUs for the
relevant quarter (as reported by Google Analytics). ARPU does not include Other Initiatives revenue. 

ARPU was 0.33 in the third
quarter of 2024, a decrease of 11 from the second quarter of 2024. Given that we are currently in the early stages of monetizing our
user base, we expect to see some lag in revenue relative to our users, particularly during periods of high user growth. As a result,
in the third quarter we saw a decrease in ARPU as revenue growth slightly lagged our strong MAU growth from the lead-up to the United
States presidential election. 

30 

We regularly review, have
adjusted in the past, and may in the future adjust our processes for calculating our key business metrics to improve their accuracy, including
through the application of new data or technologies or product changes that may allow us to identify previously undetected spam activity.
As a result of such adjustments, our key business metrics may not be comparable period-over-period.

Revenues 

Revenues increased by 7.1
million to 25.1 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, of which
 5.9 million was attributable to an increase in Audience Monetization revenues and 1.2 million was attributable to higher Other Initiatives.
The increase in Audience Monetization revenues was mainly due to higher advertising and subscription revenue. The increase in revenue
from Other Initiatives was mostly due to more advertising inventory being monetized by our publisher network and an increase in cloud
services offered. 

31 

Cost of Services 

Cost of services decreased
by 3.3 million to 36.4 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The
decrease was due to a decrease in programming and content costs of 5.4 million, offset by an increase of 1.7 million in share-based
compensation and 0.4 million in other cost of services. The decrease in programming and content costs was primarily due to a reduction
of 7.9 million in guaranteed creator commitment costs, which was partially offset by a 2.5 million increase in the creators share
of revenue. 

General and Administrative Expenses 

General and administrative expenses increased by
 23.0 thousand to 9.7 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The
increase was mainly due to payroll and related expenses offset by a decrease in other administrative expenses such as public company-related
costs, including legal, insurance, and other administrative services. 

Research and Development Expenses 

Research and development expenses
decreased by 0.5 million to 4.7 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30,
2023. The decrease was mainly due to a decrease in payroll and related expenses of 0.5 million. 

Sales and Marketing Expenses 

Sales and marketing expenses
increased by 0.8 million to 4.0 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30,
2023. The increase was due to an increase in payroll and related expenses of 0.8 million. 

Acquisition-related Transaction Costs 

Acquisition-related transaction
costs decreased by 0.4 million to nil in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30,
2023. Acquisition-related transaction costs for the three months ended September 30, 2023 consisted of transaction costs incurred related
to acquisitions completed in 2023. 

Amortization and Depreciation 

Amortization and depreciation
increased by 1.8 million to 3.1 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30,
2023. The increase was due to an increase of 0.6 million from depreciation on our property and equipment as we continue to build out
our infrastructure as well as an increase in amortization from intangible assets of 1.2 million. 

Change in Fair Value of Contingent Consideration 

Change in fair value of contingent
consideration increased by 1.3 million to nil for the three months ended September 30, 2024. The contingent consideration liability
arose in connection with the Callin acquisition and the fair value of this contingent consideration was measured using the fair value
of the expected number of shares to be issued and the Company s share price at closing. The gain from the change in fair value of
contingent consideration in 2023 was directly attributable to changes in the Company s share price since the closing and the probability
of contingencies being met. On May 15, 2024, the contingent consideration was derecognized and reclassified to equity. 

32 

Interest Income 

Interest income decreased
by 1.7 million to 1.9 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The
decrease was due to the fact that the Company invested less in money market funds, treasury bills, and term deposits. 

Other Income (Expense) 

Other income (expense) decreased
by 0.1 million to an immaterial amount for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30,
2023. The decrease was primarily due to lower foreign currency rate fluctuation as we maintained the majority of our cash balance in U.S.
dollars, which is our functional currency, as of September 30, 2024. 

Change in Fair Value of Warrant Liability 

Change in fair value of warrant
liability decreased by 8.2 million resulting in a loss of 0.8 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024. The warrant liability
arose in connection with the warrants offered as part of the Business Combination. As these warrants meet the classification of a financial
liability in accordance with ASC 815-40, the related warrant liability is measured at its fair value, determined in accordance with ASC
820, at each reporting period. The fair value of this warrant liability was measured using the fair value of the Company s warrants
listed on the Nasdaq. The decrease in the change in fair value of warrant liability is directly attributable to changes in the trading
price of Rumble s warrants. 

Income Tax Benefit (Expense) 

Income tax benefit (expense)
increased by 0.1 million to 0.1 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30,
2023.

Revenues 

Revenues increased by 4.7
million to 65.3 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, of which 2.4
million was attributable to an increase in Audience Monetization revenues and higher Other Initiatives revenues of 2.3 million. The increase
in Audience Monetization was mainly due to increases in subscription, platform hosting fees and tipping fees, offset by decreases in advertising
fees. The increase in revenue from Other Initiatives was mostly due to more advertising inventory being monetized by our publisher network
and cloud services offered. 

Cost of Services 

Cost of services decreased
by 2.7 million to 103.9 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The
decrease was due to a decrease in programming and content costs of 7.6 million, offset by an increase of 1.5 million in other cost of
services and 3.4 million in share-based compensation. The decrease in programming and content costs was primarily due to a reduction
of 9.0 million in guaranteed creator commitment costs, which was partially offset by a 1.4 million increase in the creators share
of revenue. 

34 

General and Administrative Expenses 

General and administrative
expenses increased by 2.0 million to 29.4 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September
30, 2023. The increase was due to increases in payroll and related expenses of 1.2 million and share-based compensation of 2.6 million,
offset by a decrease in other administrative expenses of 1.8 million. The 2.6 million increase in share-based compensation was related
to the recognition of contingent shares issued in connection with the Callin acquisition that was accounted for as a post-combination
expense as well as the expense of previously and newly granted restricted stock units and stock options for certain employees and executives.
The 1.8 million decrease in other administrative expenses was mainly driven by public company-related costs, including legal, insurance,
and other administrative services. 

Research and Development Expenses 

Research and development expenses
increased by 2.4 million to 14.5 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30,
2023. The increase was due to an increase in payroll and related expenses of 2.1 million, as well as a 0.3 million increase in costs
related to computer software and hardware, and other expenses used in research and development-related activity. 

Sales and Marketing Expenses 

Sales and marketing expenses
increased by 3.3 million to 13.5 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30,
2023. The increase was due to an increase of 2.3 million in payroll and related expenses, 0.5 million in consulting services, and 0.5
million due to other marketing and public relations activities. 

Acquisition-related Transaction Costs 

Acquisition-related transaction
costs decreased by 1.2 million to nil in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023.
Acquisition-related transaction costs for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 consisted of transaction costs incurred related to
acquisitions completed in 2023. 

Amortization and Depreciation 

Amortization and depreciation
increased by 6.0 million to 9.1 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30,
2023. The increase was due to an increase of 1.9 million from depreciation on our property and equipment as we continue to build out
our infrastructure as well as an increase in amortization from intangible assets of 4.1 million. 

Change in Fair Value of Contingent Consideration 

Change in fair value of contingent
consideration increased by 3.1 million resulting in a loss of 1.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The contingent
consideration liability arose in connection with the Callin acquisition and the fair value of this contingent consideration was measured
using the fair value of the expected number of shares to be issued and the Company s share price at closing. The gain/loss from
the change in fair value of contingent consideration can be directly attributable to changes in the Company s share price since
the closing and the probability of contingencies being met. 

Interest Income 

Interest income decreased
by 3.9 million to 6.6 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The
decrease was due to the fact that the Company invested less in money market funds, treasury bills, and term deposits. 

35 

Other Income (Expense) 

Other income (expense) decreased
by 0.2 million to 0.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The
decrease was primarily due to lower foreign currency rate fluctuation as we maintained the majority of our cash balance in U.S. dollars,
which is our functional currency, as of September 30, 2024. 

Change in Fair Value of Warrant Liability 

Change in fair value of warrant
liability decreased by 2.1 million resulting in a loss of 1.5 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The warrant liability
arose in connection with the warrants offered as part of the Business Combination. As these warrants meet the classification of a financial
liability in accordance with ASC 815-40, the related warrant liability is measured at its fair value, determined in accordance with ASC
820, at each reporting period. The fair value of this warrant liability was measured using the fair value of the Company s warrants
listed on the Nasdaq. The decrease in the change in fair value of warrant liability is directly attributable to changes in the trading
price of Rumble s warrants. 

Income Tax Expense 

Income tax expense decreased
by an immaterial amount in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Since the completion of our
Business Combination in September 2022, we have financed operations primarily through cash generated from operating activities and the
funds raised from our Business Combination. The primary short-term requirements for liquidity and capital are to fund general working
capital and capital expenditures. 

As of September 30, 2024,
our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balance was 132.0 million. Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities consist
of cash on deposit with banks and amounts held in money market funds, treasury bills, and term deposits. 

As
we have consistently stated, we are using a substantial portion of funds to acquire content by providing economic incentives to a small
number of content creators, including sports leagues. As of September 30, 2024, we had entered into programming and content agreements
with a minimum contractual cash commitment of 38 million. A significant amount of these minimum contractual cash commitments will be
paid over 12 to 24 months, commencing in 2024. 

The following table presents
a summary of the unaudited condensed consolidated interim statement of cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:

 9.9 million changes in amortization and depreciation, 1.3 million changes in trade and barter revenue and expense, as well as changes
in operating assets and liabilities. The increase in net cash used in operating activities during the nine months ended September 30,

assets, 3.9 million in cash paid in connection with the acquisitions of Callin and North River, and 0.1 million in purchase of marketable
securities, net of sales and maturities of marketable securities. The increase in net cash used in investing activities during the nine
months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was due to an increase in purchases of intangible
assets and marketable securities, which were partially offset by reduced spending on property and equipment. Additionally, the increase
in net cash used was related to cash paid to non-accredited investors related to the Callin acquisition and cash paid in connection with
the North River acquisition in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as well as cash acquired in connection with the Callin acquisition
in the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 

To supplement our consolidated
financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, we use certain non-GAAP financial measures, as described
below, to understand and evaluate our core operating performance. These non-GAAP financial measures, which may be different than similarly
titled measures used by other companies, are presented to enhance investors overall understanding of our financial performance
and should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP.
We use the non-GAAP financial measure of: Adjusted EBITDA, which is defined as net income (loss) excluding interest income (expense),
net, other income (expense), net; provision for income taxes, depreciation and amortization, share-based compensation expense, acquisition-related
expense, change in fair value of warrants, and change in fair value of contingent consideration. The Company s management believes
that it is important to consider Adjusted EBITDA, in addition to net income (loss), as it helps identify trends in our business that could
otherwise be masked by the effect of the gains and losses that are included in net income (loss) but excluded from Adjusted EBITDA. 

Adjusted EBITDA should not
be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. There are a number of
limitations related to the use of Adjusted EBITDA rather than net income (loss), the nearest GAAP equivalent. As a result of these limitations,
you should consider Adjusted EBITDA alongside other financial performance measures, including net income (loss) and our other financial
results presented in accordance with GAAP. The following table presents a reconciliation of net income (loss), the most directly comparable
financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, to Adjusted EBITDA:

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 

We prepare our unaudited condensed consolidated
interim financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America US
GAAP ). The preparation of condensed consolidated interim financial statements also requires us to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs and expenses and related disclosures. We evaluate our estimates
on a continuous basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable
under the circumstances. Actual results could differ significantly from the estimates made by our management. To the extent that there
are differences between our estimates and actual results, our future financial statement presentation, financial condition, results of
operations and cash flows will be affected. 

We believe the following key
accounting policies require significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our condensed consolidated interim financial
statements. Critical accounting policies and estimates are those that we consider the most important to the portrayal of our financial
condition and results of operations because they require our most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the
need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. Accordingly, we believe that these are the most critical
to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our financial condition and results of operations. 

For further information on
the summary of significant accounting policies and the effect on our condensed consolidated interim financial statements, see Note 2,
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the Annual Financial Statements. 

Acquisitions (Business Combination vs Asset
Acquisition) 

The Company evaluates whether
acquired net assets should be accounted for as a business combination or an asset acquisition by first applying a screen test to determine
whether substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or group of similar
identifiable assets. If so, the transaction is accounted for as an asset acquisition. If not, the Company applies its judgment to determine
whether the acquired net assets meet the definition of a business by considering if the set includes an acquired input, process, and the
ability to create outputs. 

Valuation of Intangible Assets 

The Company acquired intangible
assets in connection with the acquisitions of Callin and North River. A valuation was performed to determine the estimated fair value
of identifiable intangible assets related to the acquisition. Judgment is required to estimate the fair value of these identifiable intangible
assets. We may use quoted market prices, prices for similar assets, present value techniques, and other valuation techniques such as the
depreciated replacement cost and relief from royalty methods to prepare these estimates. We may need to make estimates of future cash
flows and discount rates as well as other assumptions in order to implement these valuation techniques. Due to the degree of judgment
involved in our estimation techniques, our estimate may result in a significant difference in the estimation of fair value. 

Share-based Compensation 

The Company issues equity
awards such as stock options and restricted stock units to certain of its employees, directors, officers and consultants. We account for
equity awards by recognizing the fair value of share-based compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the service period of the
award. 

For equity awards with a service
condition, the fair value is estimated on the grant date using the Black-Scholes option pricing model which takes into account the following
inputs: stock price, expected term, volatility, and risk-free interest rate. For equity awards with a market condition, the fair value
is estimated on the grant date using a Monte Carlo simulation methodology that includes simulating the stock price using a risk-neutral
Geometric Brownian Motion-based pricing model. Changes in the estimated inputs or using other option valuation methods may result in materially
different option values and share-based compensation expense. 

39 

For equity awards with a
performance condition, the Company assesses the likelihood of the performance condition underlying an award being met and recognizes a
share-based compensation expense associated with that award only if it is probable the performance condition will be met. Where the performance
condition underlying an award is a change in control, the Company considers the performance condition to be probable only when it occurs. 

Income Taxes 

The Company is subject to
income taxes in the United States and other foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income
taxes and income tax assets and liabilities, including evaluating uncertainties in the application of accounting principles and complex
tax laws. 

Uncertain tax positions are
accounted for using a comprehensive model for the manner in which a company should recognize, measure, present and disclose in its financial
statements all material uncertain income tax positions. The Company reviews its nexus in various tax jurisdictions and the Company s
tax positions related to all open tax years for events that could change the status of its tax liability, if any, or require an additional
liability to be recorded. Such events may be the resolution of issues raised by a taxing authority, expiration of the statute of limitations
for a prior open tax year or new transactions for which a tax position may be deemed to be uncertain. Those positions, for which management s
assessment is that there is more than a 50 percent probability of sustaining the position upon challenge by a taxing authority based
upon its technical merits, are subjected to the measurement criteria. 

Trade and Barter Transactions 

The Company engages in trade
and barter transactions whereby the Company and its counterparty exchange media campaigns or other promotional services. The Company reviews
each transaction to ensure the advertising it receives has economic substance and records revenue in an amount equal to the fair value
of the products and services received unless this is not reasonable to estimate, in which case the consideration is measured based on
the standalone selling price of the advertising inventory promised or delivered to the customer. Trade and barter revenue is recognized
when the performance obligation is fulfilled and follows the same pattern of recognition as the Company s normal advertising revenue.
Trade and barter expense is recorded when goods or services are consumed. The trade and barter expense is recorded in sales and marketing
expense in the condensed consolidated interim statement of operations. 

New Accounting Pronouncements 

See Note 2, Summary of
Significant Accounting Policies, to our Annual Financial Statements for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022. 

JOBS Act Accounting Election 

We are an emerging growth
company, as defined in the JOBS Act. Under the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies can delay adopting new or revised accounting standards
until such time as those standards apply to private companies. We intend to elect to adopt new or revised accounting standards under private
company adoption timelines. Accordingly, the timing of our adoption of new or revised accounting standards will not be the same as other
public companies that are not emerging growth companies or that have opted out of using such extended transition period and our financial
statements may not be comparable to the financial statements of public companies that comply with such new or revised accounting standards. 

40 

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE
DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 

We are exposed to certain
market risks as part of our ongoing business operations. 

Credit and Concentration Risk 

We are exposed to credit
risk on our cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, and accounts receivable. We place cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities
with financial institutions with high credit standing, and we place excess cash in money market funds, treasury bills, and deposits. We
are exposed to credit risk on our accounts receivable in the event of default by a customer. We bill our customers under customary payment
terms and review customers for their creditworthiness. The term between invoicing and payment due date is not significant. A meaningful
portion of our revenue is attributable to service agreements with one customer. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023,
one customer accounted for 3,192,053 and 5,751,157 or 13 and 32 of revenue, respectively. For the nine months
ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, one customer accounted for 11,671,470 and 29,762,071 or 18 and 49 of revenue,
respectively. As of September 30, 2024, one customer accounted for 11 of accounts receivable. As of December 31, 2023, one customer
accounted for 35 of accounts receivable. 

Interest Rate Risk 

We are exposed to interest
rate risk on our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. As of September 30, 2024, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable
securities of 132.0 million, consisting of investments in money market funds, treasury bills, and term deposits for which the fair
market value would be affected by changes in the general level of interest rates. However, due to the short-term maturities and the low-risk
profile of our investments, an immediate 10 change in interest rates would not have a material effect on the fair market value of our
cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation of Disclosure
Controls and Procedures 

Our
management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, have reviewed and evaluated the
effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )) as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report. Based
on this review and evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure
controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information required by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange
Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms and (ii) accumulated
and communicated to management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Changes in Internal
Controls over Financial Reporting 

There
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the period covered by this Quarterly Report that have materially
affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

41 

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS. 

We are, and from time to time
may become, involved in various legal proceedings arising in the normal course of our business activities, such as copyright infringement
and tort claims arising from user-uploaded content, patent infringement claims, breach of contract claims, government demands, putative
class actions based upon consumer protection or privacy laws and other matters. The amounts that may be recovered in such matters may
be subject to insurance coverage. 

On January 2022, we received
notification of a lawsuit filed by Kosmayer Investment Inc. KII against Rumble and Mr. Pavlovski in the Ontario Superior
Court of Justice, alleging fraudulent misrepresentation in connection with KII s decision to redeem its shares of Rumble in August
2020. The case remains in discovery. KII is seeking rescission of such redemption such that, following such rescission, KII would own
20 of the issued and outstanding shares of Rumble or, in the alternative, damages for the lost value of the redeemed shares, which KII
has alleged to be worth 419.0 million (based on the value ascribed to the shares of Rumble in the Business Combination), together with
other damages including punitive damages and costs. The case remains in discovery. Although we believe that the allegations are meritless
and intend to vigorously defend against them, the result or impact of such claim is uncertain, and could result in, among other things,
damages, and/or awards of attorneys fees or expenses. 

In January 2021, we filed
an antitrust lawsuit against Google in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, alleging that Google
unlawfully gives an advantage to its YouTube platform over Rumble in search engine results and in the mobile phone market. In June 2021,
Google filed a partial motion to dismiss the lawsuit and a motion to strike; in July 2022, the court denied Google s motion. On
October 11, 2024, Google filed a motion for summary judgment; the court has scheduled a hearing on that motion for January 23, 2025. Trial
remains scheduled for May 19, 2025. 

In addition in May 2024, we
filed a second antitrust lawsuit against Google, also in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, related
to Google s monopolization of the online advertising market. This lawsuit is separate and distinct from the self-preferencing lawsuit
filed in January 2021. In August 2024, we filed an amended complaint, and in September 2024, Google filed a motion to dismiss. In parallel
to the proceedings in the Northern District of California, the U.S. Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation (JPML) filed a conditional
order to transfer the case to the existing proceeding, In re: Google Digital Advertising Antitrust Litigation (JPML No. 3010).
Google has opposed that motion, and the JPML has set a hearing on the transfer for December 5, 2024. 

Along with co-plaintiff Eugene
Volokh, in December 2022, we filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York to block the enforcement
of New York State s Social Media Law. In February 2023, the court granted our motion for a preliminary injunction, halting enforcement
of the law. The New York Attorney General appealed that decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, where the appeal
remains pending. 

In November 2023, we
filed a defamation lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida against Nandini Jammi and Claire Atkin, co-founders
of an organization that targets news outlets and platforms that do not adhere to their political worldview. The lawsuit seeks actual,
presumed, and punitive damages against Jammi and Atkin for their defamatory statements about Rumble, in addition to all costs and fees
associated with the case. We have also asked the court to prohibit the defendants from repeating their false statements. In May 2024,
the defendants filed a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim. That motion is pending before the court, which held a hearing on
November 7, 2024. 

In August 2024, we filed an
antitrust lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas against the World Federation of Advertisers, WPP plc,
and GroupM Worldwide LLC alleging a conspiracy to withhold advertising revenue from Rumble and other digital media platforms. The lawsuit
seeks a declaration that the defendants conduct is illegal, a permanent injunction against the conduct, damages, interest, and
legal fees, among other relief. In September 2024, we filed an amended complaint, which added Diageo plc as a defendant. We are in the
process of serving the amended complaint on the defendants. 

42 

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS. 

Except as set forth below,
there have been no material changes to the risk factors described under the caption Risk Factors in our Annual Report on
Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. You should carefully consider the risks, uncertainties and cautionary statements described
therein, together with the other disclosures in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in our other public filings with the SEC. Any such
risks and uncertainties, as well as risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial, may
materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. 

Risks Relating to Our Business 

We have offered and intend to continue to
offer incentives, including economic incentives, to content creators to join our platform, and these arrangements may involve fixed payment
obligations that are not contingent on actual revenue or performance metrics generated by the applicable content creator but rather are
based on our modeled financial projections for that creator, which if not satisfied may adversely impact our financial performance, results
of operations and liquidity. 

Our user base and user engagement
growth are directly driven by the content available on our platform. We have acquired and expect to continue to acquire content by providing
economic incentives, including minimum guaranteed earnings, to a limited number of content creators, including sports leagues. These incentives
have included and may continue to include equity grants and cash payments. This content acquisition strategy is intended to allow us to
enter key content verticals and secure top content creators in those verticals before we have full monetization capabilities in place.
Our present focus is to grow users and usage consumption and experiment with monetization levers, which may not maximize profitability
in the immediate term, but which we believe positions our business for the long term. As of September 30, 2024, we had entered into programming
and content agreements with a minimum contractual cash commitment of 38 million. In addition to the minimum contractual cash commitments,
we have programming and content agreements that have variable cost arrangements. These future costs are dependent upon many factors and
are difficult to anticipate, however, these costs may be substantial. To the extent our revenue and/or user growth assumptions associated
with any particular creator do not meet our expectations, our financial performance, results of operations and liquidity may be negative
impacted, since a failure to achieve these expectations is not expected to reduce our fixed payment obligations to any such creator. 

In addition, when these programming
and content agreements expire, content creators may choose to leave the Rumble video platform in favor of competing platforms, especially
if competing platforms offer superior monetization opportunities. Creators may choose to leave our platform for other monetization-related
reasons. For example, we currently do not apportion revenues related to Rumble Premium, our subscription service that provides users ad-free
access to our content, among content creators. The loss of a material portion of our existing content creators could result in reductions
to our user base and material harm to our business and results of operations. 

Our recently launched cloud services business
may not achieve success, and, as a result, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. 

Our recent expansion into
the cloud service business may not be successful and involves various risks relating to this business that may negatively affect our operating
results, including: 

our ability to derive an optimal pricing model that enables us to derive sufficient value from our customers
while attracting new customers and retaining existing customers; 

our reliance on third-party providers for data center space and colocation services and on public cloud
providers to prevent service disruptions; 

the intense competition that we face, including from companies with longer operating histories, greater
name recognition, larger customer bases and significantly greater financial, technical, sales, marketing and other resources than we have; 

our ability to attract and retain highly qualified personnel, particularly software and cloud engineers
and sales and customer experience personnel; 

the possibility that we may be unable to maintain and improve our platform performance, especially during
peak usage times; 

43 

the possibility that we may underestimate or overestimate our data center capacity requirements and our
capital expenditures on data centers, servers and equipment; 

our ability to obtain or retain standard industry security certifications for our platform and products; 

our exposure to possible liability and harm to our reputation if the security of our cloud is breached,
resulting in the exposure of our customers data, including personal information, to cyber criminals and other nefarious actors; 

the possibility that we may be unable to maintain the compatibility of our platform with third-party applications
that our customers use in their businesses; and 

our ability to respond to rapid technological changes with new solutions and services offerings. 

The occurrence of any of these
factors, or our inability to successfully mitigate the results of the associated impact, could also damage our reputation, negatively
impact our relationship with our customers, and otherwise materially harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition. 

Risks related to our e-commerce business may result in our broader
business, financial condition and results of operations being adversely affected. 

We recently launched partnerships through which
we sell Rumble-branded products through our online store, and we plan to expand such product partnerships in the future. This expansion
involves various risks that may negatively affect our operating results, including: 

expansion into new brands, products, services, and technologies will subject us to additional reputational, business, legal, regulatory
and financial risks; 

inability to build and maintain strong brands, including due to unfavorable customer feedback and negative publicity; 

notwithstanding agreements by our partners to assume liability for the Rumble-branded products they place in our online store, we
may be subject to product liability and similar claims and regulatory actions if products sold through our store result in harm, personal
injury, death, or environmental or property damage; 

risks related to additional tax liabilities and collection obligations; 

market competition could adversely affect prices and demand for the Rumble-branded products we distribute; 

disruptions in our supply chain and other factors affecting the availability and distribution of our products could adversely impact
our business; and 

risks related to online transactions and payment methods. 

The occurrence of any of these factors, or our
inability to successfully mitigate the results of the associated impact, could also damage our reputation, negatively impact our relationships
with our customers, and otherwise materially harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition. 

We derive the majority of our revenue from advertising. The failure
to attract new advertisers, the loss of existing advertisers, or the reduction of or failure by existing advertisers to maintain or increase
their advertising budgets may adversely affect our business and operating results. 

For the years ended December
31, 2023 and 2022, advertising revenue represents 74 and 79 of total revenue. In addition, a substantial portion of our revenue is derived
one advertiser accounting for approximately 46 and 45 of our revenue for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. As
is common in our industry, our advertisers do not have long-term advertising commitments with us. In addition, many of our advertisers
purchase advertising services through one of several large advertising agency holding companies. Our revenue could be harmed by the loss
of, or a deterioration in our relationship with, any of our largest advertisers or with any advertising agencies or the holding companies
that control them. Advertising agencies and potential new advertisers may view our advertising products and services as experimental and
unproven, and we may need to devote additional time and resources to educate them about our products and services. Advertisers may cease
doing business with us, or they may reduce the prices they are willing to pay to advertise with us, if we do not deliver ads in an effective
manner, or if they do not believe that their investment in advertising with us will generate a competitive return relative to alternatives,
including online, mobile, and traditional advertising platforms. Advertisers may refuse to advertise on our platform due to a perceived
risk to their brand safety standards, especially given the concentration of news and political content on our platform. We believe that
our access to certain advertisers has been, and may continue to be, inhibited by the apparent political bias of these companies, some
of whom we believe may exercise near monopolistic control over the advertising industry. In response, we recently filed an antitrust lawsuit
alleging a conspiracy to withhold advertising revenue from Rumble and other digital media platforms. Our actions to counter these efforts,
whether through litigation or publicity campaigns, may not be successful. Any of the foregoing developments may adversely affect our business
and operating results. 

44 

Negative media campaigns may adversely impact
our financial performance, results of operations, and relationships with our business partners, including content creators and advertisers. 

Our commitment to diversity
of opinion and refusal to censor content on our platforms has in the past resulted and is likely to continue to result in malicious media
campaigns and advertiser boycotts directed against us. For example, in August 2024, we filed a lawsuit against the World Federation of
Advertisers, as well as the advertising agency WPP and its subsidiary GroupM. Our lawsuit alleges that an initiative called the Global
Alliance for Responsible Media (GARM), created by the WFA, established arbitrary standards for the content on digital platforms where
its members may want to advertise. GARM used those one-size-fits-all standards to perpetrate an advertiser boycott against Rumble and
other platforms. The suit also notes that GARM has vast reach since it counts the six largest ad agency holding companies among its members,
including defendant WPP. We subsequently amended our complaint to add Diageo plc as a defendant. 

Media campaigns and advertising
boycotts against us may be intended to interfere with our relationships with streaming partners and advertisers, and these campaigns and
boycotts may intensify if political polarization increases in the United States and Canada. 

We expect that the proliferation
of alternative media, including on our platform, will continue to be viewed as a growing competitive threat by established news organizations,
and may result in an escalation, both in frequency and intensity, of negative publicity campaigns against us and our creators. Such campaigns,
even if groundless in nature, may result in negative public perception and damage to relationships with our business partners, including
additional or more intense advertiser boycotts, which may negatively impact our operating results and future growth potential.
