 The Company uses certain operating performance measures, specifically consolidated gross margin, operating margin by segment and consolidated operating margin, to manage the Company's businesses, set operational goals, and establish performance targets for incentive compensation for the Company's employees. The Company defines consolidated gross margin as a percentage of total consolidated gross profit to total consolidated net sales. The Company defines operating margin by segment as a percentage of total income from operations by segment to total net sales by segment and consolidated operating margin as a percentage of total consolidated income from operations to total consolidated net sales. The Company believes consolidated gross margin, consolidated operating margin, and operating margin by segment may be useful to investors in evaluating the profitability of the Company's segments and the Company on a consolidated basis. 
 
 Overview 
 Gibraltar Industries, Inc. (the "Company") is a leading manufacturer and provider of products and services for the residential, renewable energy, agtech and infrastructure markets. 
 The Company operates and reports its results in the following four reporting segments: 
 Residential 
 Renewables 
 Agtech 
 Infrastructure 
 The Company serves customers primarily in North America including home improvement retailers, wholesalers, distributors, contractors, renewable energy (solar) developers, and institutional and commercial growers of fruits, vegetables, flowers and other plants. 
 At September 30, 2024, the Company operated twenty-eight facilities, comprised of twenty-one manufacturing facilities, two distribution centers, and five offices, which are located in fifteen states, Canada, and China. The Company's operational infrastructure provides the necessary scale to support local, regional, and national customers in each of the Company's markets.

Table of Contents 

 Recent Trends 
 The Company's customers in the Renewables business continue to be impacted by regulatory, trade and tax policy changes, uncertainty primarily due to investigations and pending finalization of governmental guidance. These include but are not limited to: 
 In May 2024, a second independent anti-dumping and countervailing duties ("AD/CVD") investigation was initiated by the U.S. Department of Commerce claiming potentially illegal trade practices with Cambodia, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam, the same four countries named in the 2022 AD/CVD case, for which resolution is anticipated in 2025; 
 Expiration in 2024 of the Presidential Executive Order that paused tariffs on imports of solar modules for two years. Modules procured during this pause could be subject to significant tariffs if not installed and operating prior to the December 3, 2024 expiration of the tariff moratorium; and 
 The Department of Treasury has not yet published final guidance relative to rules under the Inflation Reduction Act in order to maximize tax incentives. 
 As this uncertainty continues, a portion of our customers paused signing new contracts as they work through trade and/or regulatory issues specific to their projects, including gathering documents to satisfy solar module import tracking requirements. 
 Business Strategy 
 The Company's mission is to make life better for people and the planet, fueled by advancing the disciplines of engineering, science, and technology. The Company is innovating to reshape critical markets in sustainable power, comfortable and efficient living, and productive growing throughout North America. Furthermore, the Company strives to create compounding and sustainable value for its stockholders and stakeholders with strong and relevant leadership positions in higher growth, profitable end markets focused on addressing some of the world's most challenging opportunities. The foundation of the Company's strategy is built on three core pillars: Business System, Portfolio Management, and Organization Development. 
 1. Business System reflects the necessary systems, processes, and management tools required to deliver consistent and continuous performance improvement, every day. The Company's business system is a critical enabler to grow, scale, and deliver its plans. The Company's focus is on deploying effective tools to drive growth, improve operating performance, and develop the organization utilizing 80/20 and lean quote-to-cash initiatives along with digital systems for speed, agility and responsiveness. The Business System pillar challenges existing operating paradigms, drives day-to-day performance, forces prioritization of resources, tests the Company's business models, and drives new product and services innovation. 
 2. Portfolio Management is focused on optimizing the Company s business portfolio in higher growth markets with leadership positions while ensuring its financial capital and human resources are effectively and efficiently deployed to deliver sustainable, profitable growth while increasing its relevance with customers and shaping its markets. 
 3. Organization Development drives the Company s continuous focus on ensuring it has the right design and structure to scale the organization in order to execute the Company s plans and meet commitments. The Company's focus is on creating an environment for our people to have the best opportunity for success, continue to develop, grow and learn. At core of this pillar is the Company s development process focused on helping employees reach their potential, improve performance, develop career roadmaps, identify ongoing education requirements, and respective succession plans. The Company believes doing so helps it attract and retain the best people to execute its business plans. 
 The Company believes the key elements of the Company's strategy enable the Company to respond timely to changes in the end markets the Company serves, including the broader market dynamics experienced over the past few years. The Company continues to examine the need for restructuring of the Company's operations, including consolidation of facilities, reducing overhead costs, curtailing investments in working capital, and managing the Company's business to generate incremental cash. The Company believes its strategy enables the Company to respond to volatility in commodity and other input costs and fluctuations in customer demand, along with striving to maintain and improve margins. The Company has used cash flows generated by these initiatives to improve the Company's liquidity position, invest in growth initiatives and return capital to the Company's shareholders through share repurchases. Overall, the Company continues to strive to achieve stronger financial results, make more efficient use of capital, and deliver higher stockholder returns.

 Consolidated net sales decreased by 29.5 million, or 7.6 , to 361.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The net sales decrease was largely due to a 6 decrease in organic revenue, the result of a 7 volume decline partially offset by a 1 increase in pricing to customers, along with portfolio management activities in the prior year quarter. Growth in the Company's Agtech segment was more than offset by a 5.5 million decrease in net sales related to portfolio management along with a decline in revenue in the Company's Residential, Renewables and Infrastructure segments. Consolidated backlog decreased 15 to 319 million, as compared to prior year. 
 Net sales in the Company's Residential segment decreased 15.4 million, or 6.7 , to 212.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 227.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The sales decline was driven by a slowdown in the residential market, including the repair and remodel sector, which is impeding the timing and benefit of participation gains as customers take longer to flush inventory from incumbent suppliers. 
 Net sales in the Company's Renewables segment decreased 22.3 million, or 21.0 , to 84.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 106.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023.

 Sources of Liquidity 
 The Company's primary sources of liquidity are comprised of cash on hand and its available borrowing capacity provided under the Company's Credit Agreement (the "Credit Agreement"). The Credit Agreement provides for a revolving credit facility and letters of credit in an aggregate amount equal to 400 million and terminates on December 8, 2027. The Company can request additional financing to increase the revolving credit facility to 700 million or enter into a term loan of up to 300 million subject to conditions set forth in the Credit Agreement.

 Uses of Cash / Cash Requirements 
 The Company's material short-term cash requirements primarily include accounts payable, certain employee and retiree benefit-related obligations, operating lease obligations, capital expenditures, and other purchase obligations originating in the normal course of business for inventory purchase orders and contractual service agreements. The Company's principal capital requirements are to fund its operations' working capital and capital improvements, as well as provide capital for acquisitions and to strategically allocate capital through repurchases of Company stock under the Company's current authorized program ending May 2, 2025. The Company will continue to invest in growth opportunities as appropriate while focusing on working capital efficiency and profit improvement opportunities to minimize the cash invested to operate its business. 
 Over the long-term, the Company expects that future investments, including strategic business acquisitions, may be financed through a number of sources, including internally available cash, availability under the Credit Agreement, new debt financing, the issuance of equity securities, or any combination of the aforementioned. 
 These expectations are forward-looking statements based upon currently available information and may change if conditions in the credit and equity markets deteriorate or other circumstances change. To the extent that operating cash flows are lower than current levels, or sources of financing are not available or not available at acceptable terms, the Company's future liquidity may be adversely affected. 
 Except as disclosed above, there have been no material changes in the Company's cash requirements since December 31, 2023. See Part II, Item 7 "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.
