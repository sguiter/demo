From time to time, we or our representatives have made or may make forward-looking statements, orally or in writing. 
 Such forward-looking statements may be included in various filings made by us with the SEC, in press releases or in oral statements made by or with the approval of one of our authorized executive officers.

 unexpected terminations of client contracts on short notice or reduced spending by clients for reasons beyond our control; 
 challenges related to growing our business organically as well as inorganically through acquisitions, and our ability to achieve our targeted growth rates; 
 our ability to successfully implement our NextGen program and the amount of costs, timing of incurring costs, and ultimate benefits of such plans; 
 our ability to achieve our profitability goals and maintain our capital return strategy; 
 fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, or the failure of our hedging strategies to mitigate such fluctuations; 
 our ability to meet specified service levels or milestones required by certain of our contracts;

 our ability to meet ESG expectations and commitments;

 restrictions on visas, in particular in the United States, UK and EU, or immigration more generally or increased costs of such visas or the wages we are required to pay employees on visas, which may affect our ability to compete for and provide services to our clients; 
 risks related to anti-outsourcing legislation, if adopted, and negative perceptions associated with offshore outsourcing, both of which could impair our ability to serve our clients;

During the third quarter of 2024, we borrowed million under our revolving credit facility to partially fund the acquisition of Belcan. We are required under the Credit Agreement to make scheduled quarterly principal payments on the Term Loan. 
 
 The Credit Agreement requires interest to be paid, at our option, at either the Term Benchmark, Adjusted Daily Simple RFR or the ABR Rate (each as defined in the Credit Agreement), plus, in each case, an Applicable Margin (as defined in the Credit Agreement). Initially, the Applicable Margin is with respect to Term Benchmark loans and RFR loans and with respect to ABR loans. Subsequently, the Applicable Margin with respect to Term Benchmark loans and RFR loans will be determined quarterly and may range from to , depending on our public debt ratings or, if we have not received public debt ratings, from to , depending on our Leverage Ratio, which is the ratio of indebtedness for borrowed money to Consolidated EBITDA, as defined in the Credit Agreement. Since issuance of the Term Loan, t he Term Loan has been a Term Benchmark loan. The Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants as well as a financial covenant. We were in compliance with all debt covenants and representations of the Credit Agreement as of September 30, 2024.

 Note 8 Income Taxes 
 
 Our effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, benefited from discrete items, which decreased our effective tax rate in those periods. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized a million deferred tax asset related to foreign tax credits. Additionally, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized a discrete benefit related to U.S. state income taxes. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we reached a settlement related to U.S. state income taxes, and reached an agreement with the IRS, settling tax years 2017 and 2018, both of which decreased our effective tax rate in that period. 
 We are involved in two separate ongoing disputes with the ITD in connection with previously disclosed share repurchase transactions undertaken by CTS India in 2013 and 2016 to repurchase shares from its shareholders (non-Indian Cognizant entities) valued at million and billion, respectively. 
 The 2016 transaction was undertaken pursuant to a plan approved by the High Court in Chennai, India, and resulted in the payment of million in Indian income taxes - an amount we believe includes all the applicable taxes owed for this transaction under Indian law. In March 2018, the ITD asserted that it is owed an additional billion Indian rupees million at the September 30, 2024 exchange rate) on the 2016 transaction. We deposited billion Indian rupees, representing of the disputed tax amount related to the 2016 transaction, with the ITD. Additionally, certain time deposits of CTS India were placed under lien in favor of the ITD, representing the remainder of the disputed tax amount. As of December 31, 2023, the balance of deposits under lien was billion Indian rupees, including previously earned interest, or million, was presented in "Long-term investments". 
 
 In April 2020, we received a formal assessment from the ITD on the 2016 transaction, which is consistent with the ITD's previous assertions. Our appeal was ruled unfavorably by the CITA in March 2022 and by the ITAT in September 2023. We filed an appeal against the order of the ITAT with the High Court. On January 8, 2024, the SCI ruled that, in order to proceed with the appeal, we must deposit billion Indian rupees million at the December 31, 2023 exchange rate), representing the time deposits of CTS India under lien, on the condition that, if CTS India prevails at the High Court, the amount deposited will be returned to CTS India, along with interest accrued, within four weeks of the judgment. We made the required deposit in January 2024 and, in April 2024, the case commenced before the High Court. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the deposit with the ITD was million and million, respectively at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 exchange rates, respectively presented in "Other noncurrent assets". As of December 31, 2023, million of the million in deposits under lien were held in time deposits with a maturity of less than 30 days qualifying as cash equivalent instruments and thus were considered restricted cash equivalents as of December 31, 2023. 
 The dispute in relation to the 2013 share repurchase transaction is also in litigation. At this time, the ITD has not made specific demands with regards to the 2013 transaction. 
 
 We continue to believe we have paid all applicable taxes owed on both the 2016 and the 2013 transactions and we continue to defend our positions with respect to both matters. Accordingly, we have not recorded any reserves for these matters as of September 30, 2024.

 Cash Flow Hedges 
 We have entered and continue to enter into a series of foreign exchange derivative contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges of Indian rupee denominated payments in India. These contracts are intended to partially offset the impact of movement of the Indian rupee against the U.S. dollar on future operating costs and are scheduled to mature each month during the remainder of 2024, 2025 and the first nine months of 2026. The changes in fair value of these contracts are initially reported in "Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)" in our unaudited consolidated statements of financial position and are subsequently reclassified to earnings within "Cost of revenues" and "Selling, general and administrative expenses" in our unaudited consolidated statements of operations in the same period that the forecasted Indian rupee denominated payments are recorded in earnings.

 We measure the fair value of money market funds based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and measure the fair value of our equity investment security based on the published daily net asset value at which investors can freely subscribe to or redeem from the fund. The carrying value of the time deposits approximated fair value as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
 We estimate the fair value of each foreign exchange forward contract by using a present value of expected cash flows model. This model calculates the difference between the current market forward price and the contracted forward price for each foreign exchange forward contract and applies the difference in the rates to each outstanding contract. The market forward rates include a discount and credit risk factor. We estimate the fair value of each foreign exchange option contract by using a variant of the Black-Scholes model. This model uses present value techniques and reflects the time value and intrinsic value based on observable market rates. 
 We estimate the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities associated with acquisitions using a variation of the income approach, which utilizes one or more significant inputs that are unobservable. This approach calculates the fair value of such liabilities based on the probability-weighted expected performance of the acquired entity against the target performance metric, discounted to present value when appropriate. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and the year ended December 31, 2023, there were no transfers among Level 1, Level 2 or Level 3 financial assets and liabilities.

 million, including million in punitive damages. On April 20, 2021, the USDC-SDNY issued a post-trial order that, among other things, affirmed the jury s award of million in actual damages, but reduced the award of punitive damages from million to million, thereby reducing the overall damages award from million to million. The USDC-SDNY subsequently issued a final judgment consistent with the April 20 th order. On May 26, 2021, Syntel filed a notice of appeal to the Second Circuit, and on June 3, 2021 the USDC-SDNY stayed execution of judgment pending appeal. On May 25, 2023, the Second Circuit issued an opinion affirming in part and vacating in part the judgment of the USDC-SDNY and remanding the case for further proceedings consistent with its opinion. The Second Circuit affirmed the judgment in all respects on liability but vacated the million award that had been based on avoided development costs under the DTSA, and it remanded the case to the USDC-SDNY for further evaluation of damages. On June 23, 2023, the Second Circuit issued its mandate returning the case to the USDC-SDNY. On March 13, 2024, the USDC-SDNY issued a ruling that vacates the alternate compensatory damages awards that were within the scope of the Second Circuit s remand and awards TriZetto and Cognizant approximately million in attorney s fees. On October 23, 2024, the USDC-SDNY granted TriZetto and Cognizant s motion for a new trial on the amount of compensatory damages owed to TriZetto and Cognizant. TriZetto and Cognizant will continue to vigorously pursue our claims against Syntel. We will not record any gain in our financial statements until it becomes realizable. 
 On February 28, 2019, a ruling of the SCI interpreting the India Defined Contribution Obligation altered historical understandings of the obligation, extending it to cover additional portions of the employee s income. As a result, the ongoing contributions of our affected employees and the Company were required to be increased. In the first quarter of 2019, we accrued million with respect to prior periods, assuming retroactive application of the SCI s ruling, in "Selling, general and administrative e xpenses" in our unaudited consolidated statement of operations. There is significant uncertainty as to how the liability should be calculated as it is impacted by multiple variables, including the period of assessment, the application with respect to certain current and former employees and whether interest and penalties may be assessed. Since the ruling, a variety of trade associations and industry groups have advocated to the Indian government, highlighting the harm to the information technology sector, other industries and job growth in India that would result from a retroactive application of the ruling. It is possible the Indian government will review the matter and there is a substantial question as to whether the Indian government will apply the SCI s ruling on a retroactive basis. As such, the ultimate amount of our obligation may be materially different from the amount accrued. 
 On October 31, 2016, November 15, 2016 and November 18, 2016, three putative shareholder derivative complaints were filed in New Jersey Superior Court, Bergen County, naming us, all of our then current directors and certain of our current and former officers at that time as defendants. These actions were consolidated in an order dated January 24, 2017. The complaints assert claims for breach of fiduciary duty, corporate waste, unjust enrichment, abuse of control, mismanagement, and/or insider selling by defendants. On April 26, 2017, the New Jersey Superior Court deferred further proceedings by dismissing the consolidated putative shareholder derivative litigation without prejudice but permitting the parties to file a motion to vacate the dismissal in the future. 
 
 On February 22, 2017, April 7, 2017, May 10, 2017 and March 11, 2019, four additional putative shareholder derivative complaints were filed in the USDC-NJ, naming us and certain of our current and former directors and officers at that time as defendants. These actions were consolidated in an order dated May 14, 2019. On August 3, 2020, lead plaintiffs filed a consolidated amended complaint.

Executive Summary 
 Cognizant is one of the world s leading professional services companies, engineering modern businesses and delivering strategic outcomes for our clients. We help clients modernize technology, reimagine processes and transform experiences so they can stay ahead in a fast-changing world. We provide industry expertise and close client collaboration, combining critical perspective with a flexible engagement style. We tailor our services and solutions to specific industries with an integrated global delivery model that employs client service and delivery teams based at client locations and dedicated global and regional delivery centers. Our collaborative services include digital services and solutions, consulting, application development, systems integration, quality engineering and assurance, application maintenance, infrastructure and security as well as business process services and automation. Digital services continue to be an important part of our portfolio, aligning with our clients' focus on becoming data-enabled, customer-centric and differentiated businesses. 
 In the second quarter of 2023, we initiated the NextGen program aimed at simplifying our operating model, optimizing corporate functions and consolidating and realigning office space to reflect the post-pandemic hybrid work environment. Our drive for simplification includes operating with fewer layers in an effort to enhance agility and enable faster decision making. We expect the savings generated by the program to help fund continued investments in our people, revenue growth opportunities and the modernization of our office space. 
 In connection with the NextGen program, in the third quarter of 2024 we incurred 33 million of employee separation, facility exit and other costs. Since the inception of the program, we incurred 314 million in total costs. See Note 4 to our unaudited consolidated financial statements. We currently expect to incur costs of approximately 105 million for the full year 2024, which is expected to bring the total charges under the program to approximately 335 million. The estimates of the charges and expenditures that we expect to incur in connection with the NextGen program, and the timing thereof, are subject to a number of assumptions, including local law requirements in various jurisdictions, and actual amounts may differ materially from estimates. In addition, we may incur other charges or cash expenditures not currently contemplated due to unanticipated events that may occur in connection with the NextGen program.

 our Health Sciences segment, partially offset by weakness in our Products and Resources (excluding the impact of our recently completed acquisitions) and Communications, Media and Technology segments. 
 Our operating margin increased to 14.6 for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, from 14.0 for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. Our Adjusted Operating Margin 2 decreased to 15.3 for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, from 15.5 for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. Our GAAP and Adjusted Operating Margins for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the quarter ended September 30, 2023 were positively impacted by net savings generated from our NextGen program and the beneficial impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements, while being negatively impacted by increased compensation costs, primarily as a result of a merit increase cycle completed during the quarter, and the dilutive impact of recently completed acquisitions, primarily driven by transaction and integration related expenses and amortization of acquired intangibles. In addition, our GAAP operating margins for the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, were negatively impacted by the NextGen charges, as discussed in Note 4 to our unaudited consolidated financial statements, which were excluded from our Adjusted Operating Margin. 
 As a global professional services company, we compete on the basis of the knowledge, experience, insights, skills and talent of our employees and the value they can provide to our clients. We closely monitor attrition trends focusing on the metric that we believe is most relevant to our business. This metric, which we refer to as Voluntary Attrition - Tech Services, includes all voluntary separations with the exception of employees in our Intuitive Operations and Automation practice. For the trailing twelve months ended September 30, 2024 our Voluntary Attrition - Tech Services was 14.6 as compared to 16.2 for the trailing twelve months ended September 30, 2023. We finished the third quarter of 2024 with approximately 340,100 employees, inclusive of Belcan employees, as compared to 346,600 employees at the end of the third quarter of 2023. 
 Business Outlook 
 We continue to expect the long-term focus of our clients to be on their digital transformation into AI-ready, software-driven, data-enabled, customer-centric and differentiated businesses. We believe clients will continue to contend with industry-specific changes driven by evolving digital technologies, uncertainty in the regulatory environment, industry consolidation and convergence as well as international trade policie s and other macroeconomic and geopolitical factors, including the uncertainty related to the global economy, which has affected and may continue to affect their demand for our services. 
 We increasingly use AI-based technologies, including GenAI, in our client offerings and our own internal operations. AI technologies and services are part of a highly competitive and rapidly evolving market. We plan to make significant investments in our AI capabilities to meet the needs of our clients and harness its value in a flexible, secure, scalable and responsible way. As AI-based technologies evolve, we expect that some services that we currently perform for our clients will be replaced by AI or other forms of automation. This may lead to reduced demand for certain services or harm our ability to obtain favorable pricing or other terms for our services. 
 We currently expect to incur total costs of approximately 335 million in connection with the NextGen program, which started in the second quarter of 2023, with approximately 105 million of such costs anticipated in 2024. See "Executive Summary". In addition to the NextGen program, potential tax law and other regulatory changes, including possible U.S. corporate income tax reform and the Code on Social Security, 2020 in India, among other items, may impact our future results. We expect that the Code on Social Security, 2020, if enacted as currently written, could result in a material one-time increase to our post-employment liability for past service and would also modestly increase our costs for employment and post-employment benefits prospectively. In addition, in March 2024, India and Mauritius signed a Protocol to amend the India-Mauritius Income Tax Treaty. We are currently evaluating the potential impact of the amendment, which, depending on its final terms when entered into force, could increase our effective income tax rate, as CTS India is a subsidiary of our wholly-owned Mauritius entity. 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we completed the acquisition of Belcan. See Note 3 to our unaudited consolidated financial statements. This acquisition is expected to have a modest near-term dilutive impact to operating margin, primarily due to transaction and integration-related expenses and amortization of acquired intangibles.

Change in revenues was driven by the following factors: 4 
 Reduced demand for discretionary work negatively impacted revenues across all segments. Clients in our Communications, Media and Technology, Products and Resources and Financial Services segments were particularly affected; 
 Recently completed acquisitions contributed approximately 200 basis points of growth to the overall change in revenues, including approximately 750 basis points of growth to our Products and Resources segment (primarily in North America) and approximately 100 basis points of growth to our Communications, Media and Technology segment (primarily in North America); 
 Health Sciences revenues in the North America were positively impacted by the ramp up of several recently won large deals and the resale of third-party products in connection with our integrated offerings strategy; 
 Revenue growth in the Financial Services segment was positively impacted by growth among banking clients, while being negatively impacted by lower resales of third-party products in connection with our integrated offerings strategy in the current period; and 
 Communications, Media and Technology revenues, in our North America and Europe regions, were negatively impacted by weakness from technology customers.

Our cost of revenues consists primarily of salaries, incentive-based compensation, stock-based compensation expense, employee benefits, project-related immigration and travel for technical personnel, subcontracting and costs of third-party products and services relating to revenues. The increase, as a percentage of revenues, was primarily driven by increased compensation costs, primarily as a result of a merit increase cycle completed in the quarter, partially offset by foreign currency exchange rate movements. 

SG A Expenses (Exclusive of Depreciation and Amortization Expense) 
 
 SG A expenses consist primarily of salaries, incentive-based compensation, stock-based compensation expense, employee benefits, immigration, travel, marketing, communications, management, finance, administrative and occupancy costs. The increase, as a percentage of revenues, was primarily attributed to the impact of recently completed acquisitions, driven by transaction and integration-related expenses, and increased compensation costs, primarily as a result of a merit increase cycle completed in the quarter, partially offset by net savings generated from our NextGen program.

 A predominant portion of our costs in India are denominated in the Indian rupee, representing approximately 24 of our global operating costs during the three months ended September 30, 2024. These costs are subject to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, which have an impact on our results of operations. We enter into foreign exchange derivative contracts to hedge certain Indian rupee denominated payments in India. These hedges are intended to mitigate the volatility of the changes in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the Indian rupee. Net of the impact of the hedges, the depreciation of the Indian rupee positively impacted our operating margin for the three months ended September 30, 2024 by 45 basis points as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Excluding the impact of applicable designated cash flow hedges, the depreciation of the Indian rupee against the U.S. dollar positively impacted our operating margin by 25 basis points during the three months ended September 30, 2024. Each additional 1.0 change in exchange rate between the Indian rupee and the U.S. dollar will have the effect of moving our operating margin by 18 basis points (excluding the impact of the hedges). The settlement of our cash flow hedges had a positive impact of 10 basis points on our operating margin during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to a negative impact of 10 basis points during the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Segment Operating Profit 
 
 Segment operating profit and operating margin percentage were as follows: 

Segment operating profit Segment operating margin 
 In the third quarter of 2024, segment operating margins across all our segments were positively impacted by savings generated from our NextGen program and the beneficial impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements, partially offset by increased compensation costs, primarily as a result of a merit increase cycle. Segment operating profit in the Financial Services segment in the third quarter of 2023 was negatively impacted by resales of third-party products in connection with our integrated offerings strategy. Segment operating profit in the Health Sciences segment in the third quarter of 2024 was negatively impacted by resales of third-party products in connection with our integrated offerings strategy and by higher costs typical to the initial phases of several recently won large deals in this segment. Segment operating profit in the Products and Resources segment in the third quarter of 2024 was negatively impacted by the dilutive impact of the Belcan acquisition.

 The foreign currency exchange losses were attributed to the remeasurement of net monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of our subsidiaries. The gains on foreign exchange forward contracts not designated as hedging instruments related to the realized and unrealized gains and losses on cont racts entered into to offset our foreign currency exposures. As of September 30, 2024, the notional value of our undesignated hedges was 1,026 million . Interest income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 1 million as compared to the same period in 2023. While our invested balances during the three months ended September 30, 2024 were lower as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, due to the required payment related to the ITD dispute in January 2024 (see Note 8 to our unaudited consolidated financial statements) and the Belcan acquisition in August 2024, we benefited from higher interest rates compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 Portions of our disclosure include non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles and should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, and may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures should be read in conjunction with our financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. The reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to the corresponding GAAP measures set forth below should be carefully evaluated. 
 
 Our non-GAAP financial measures Adjusted Operating Margin and Adjusted Income from Operations exclude unusual items, such as NextGen charges. Our non-GAAP financial measure Adjusted Diluted EPS excludes unusual items, such as NextGen charges, and net non-operating foreign currency exchange gains or losses and the tax impact of all the applicable adjustments. For further detail on the NextGen charges, see Note 4 to our unaudited consolidated financial statements. The income tax impact of each item excluded from Adjusted Diluted EPS is calculated by applying the statutory rate and local tax regulations in the jurisdiction in which the item was incurred. Constant currency revenue growth is defined as revenues for a given period restated at the comparative period s foreign currency exchange rates measured against the comparative period's reported revenues.

 We believe providing investors with an operating view consistent with how we manage the Company provides enhanced transparency into our operating results. For internal management reporting and budgeting purposes, we use various GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision-making, to evaluate period-to-period comparisons, to determine portions of the compensation for executive officers and for making comparisons of our operating results to those of our competitors. We believe that the presentation of non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude certain costs, read in conjunction with our reported GAAP results and reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP measure, as applicable, can provide useful supplemental information to our management and investors regarding financial and business trends relating to our financial condition and results of operations. 
 A limitation of using non-GAAP financial measures versus financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP is that non-GAAP financial measures may exclude costs that are recurring such as net non-operating foreign currency exchange gains or losses. In addition, other companies may calculate non-GAAP financial measures differently than us, thereby limiting the usefulness of these non-GAAP financial measures as a comparative tool. We compensate for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from non-GAAP financial measures to allow investors to evaluate such non-GAAP financial measures.

Change in revenues was driven by the following factors: 7 
 Reduced demand for discretionary work negatively impacted revenues across all segments. Clients in our Financial Services and Products and Resources segments were particularly affected; 
 Recently completed acquisitions contributed approximately 100 basis points to the overall revenue growth, including approximately 300 basis points of growth to our Products and Resources segment (primarily in North America) and approximately 150 basis points of growth to our Communications, Media and Technology segment (primarily in North America and Continental Europe); 
 The resale of third-party products, primarily in the Health Sciences segment in North America, in connection with our integrated offerings strategy, contributed approximately 100 basis points of growth to the overall change in revenue; 
 North America revenues in the Communications, Media and Technology and Health Sciences segments were positively impacted by the ramp up of several recently won large deals; 
 Health Sciences revenues were negatively impacted by the renegotiation of a large contract with a payer client in 2023 in our North America region, which reduced the scope of services but improved the profitability of the contract; 
 Revenue decline in our United Kingdom region was primarily driven by weakness in the Financial Services and Communications, Media and Technology segments; and 
 Revenue decline in our Rest of World region was primarily driven by weakness in the Products and Resources and Financial Services segments.

Our cost of revenues consists primarily of salaries, incentive-based compensation, stock-based compensation expense, employee benefits, project-related immigration and travel for technical personnel, subcontracting and costs of third-party products and services relating to revenues. The increase, as a percentage of revenues, was due to higher compensation costs, primarily as a result of a merit increase cycle, and the impact of the resale of third-party products in connection with our integrated offerings strategy, partially offset by the beneficial impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements. 

SG A Expenses (Exclusive of Depreciation and Amortization Expense) 
 
 SG A expenses consist primarily of salaries, incentive-based compensation, stock-based compensation expense, employee benefits, immigration, travel, marketing, communications, management, finance, administrative and occupancy costs. The decrease, as a percentage of revenues, was primarily driven by the net savings generated from our NextGen program, partially offset by the impact of recently completed acquisitions, primarily driven by transaction and integration related expenses.

 Depreciation and amortization expense decreased by 1.0 , and decreased by 0.1 as a percentage of revenues, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the 2023 peri od. The decline of depreciation expense, which was driven by actions taken under our NextGen program, was partially offset by an increase in amortization expense driven by an increase in intangible assets related to our recently completed acquisitions. 
 Operating Margin and Adjusted Operating Margin 8 - Overall 

The increase in our 2024 GAAP operating margin and Adjusted Operating Margin 8 was primarily driven by net savings generated from our NextGen program and the beneficial impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements, partially offset by increased compensation costs, primarily as a result of a merit increase cycle, and the impact of the resale of third-party products in connection with our integrated offerings strategy. In addition, our 2023 and 2024 GAAP operating margins were negatively impacted by the NextGen charges, as discussed in Note 4 to our unaudited consolidated financial statements, which were excluded from our Adjusted Operating Margin.

The effective income tax rate in both periods reflects the benefits of discrete items related to U.S. state income taxes. The effective tax rate in 2024 additionally benefited from the recognition of a 40 million deferred tax asset related to foreign tax credits. The effective income tax rate in 2023 additionally benefited from the effective settlement of the IRS examination for tax years 2017 and 2018. 

In December 2021, the OECD adopted model rules for a global framework to impose a 15 global minimum tax referred to as Pillar Two with an effective date of January 1, 2024. Although management continues to monitor additional guidance from the OECD and countries implementation of Pillar Two, based on current guidance, there was no material impact for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and we believe that our net income, cash flows, or financial condition will not be materially impacted in the future by Pillar Two.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Our cash generated from operations has historically been the primary source of liquidity to fund operations and investments to grow our business. As of September 30, 2024, we had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of 2,025 million. During the third quarter of 2024, we borrowed 600 million under our revolving credit facility, to partially fund the acquisition of Belcan, bringing the available capacity under our credit facility to approximately 1.3 billion.

 Operating activities 
 The decrease in cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, was primarily driven by the 360 million payment made in relation to our dispute with the ITD in January 2024 (see Note 8 to our unaudited consolidated financial statements). 
 We monitor turnover, aging and the collection of accounts receivable by client. Our DSO calculation includes receivables, net of allowance for doubtful accounts, and contract assets, reduced by the uncollected portion of deferred revenue. Our DSO was 81 days as of September 30, 2024, an increase of 4 days from 77 days as of December 31, 2023. Our DSO was 77 days as of September 30, 2023, an increase of 3 days from 74 days as of December 31, 2022. 
 Investing activities 
 The increase in cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, was primarily driven by higher payments for business combinations, partially offset by higher net maturities of investments in 2024 as compared to 2023. 
 Financing activities 
 The decrease in cash used in financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, was primarily driven by our borrowing under the revolving credit facility to finance the Belcan acquisition in the third quarter of 2024 and lower repurchases of common stock. 
 We have a Credit Agreement providing for a 650 million Term Loan and a 1,850 million unsecured revolving credit facility, which are each due to mature in October 2027. As of September 30, 2024, we had 600 million outstanding under the revolving credit facility, consisting of a Term Benchmark loan with a maturity of October 2027 and an Interest Period (as defined in the Credit Agreement) of one month. We are required under the Credit Agreement to make scheduled quarterly principal payments on the Term Loan. We believe that we currently meet all conditions set forth in the Credit Agreement to borrow thereunder, and we are not aware of any conditions that would prevent us from borrowing part or all of the remaining available capacity under the revolving credit facility as of September 30, 2024 and through the date of this filing. See Note 7 to our unaudited consolidated financial statements. 
 
 Capital Allocation 
 Acquisitions Share Repurchases Dividend payments 

We review our capital allocation on an ongoing basis, considering our financial performance and liquidity position, investments required to execute our strategic plans and initiatives, acquisition opportunities, the economic outlook, regulatory changes and other relevant factors. As these factors may change over time, the actual amounts expended on stock repurchase activity, dividends, and acquisitions, if any, during any particular period cannot be predicted and may fluctuate from time to time. 

Other Liquidity and Capital Resources Information 
 We seek to ensure that our worldwide cash is available in the locations in which it is needed. As part of our ongoing liquidity assessments, we regularly monitor the mix of our domestic and international cash flows and cash balances. We evaluate on an ongoing basis what portion of the non-U.S. cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments is needed locally to execute our strategic plans and what amount is available for repatriation back to the United States. 
 We expect operating cash flows, cash and short-term investment balances, together with the available capacity under our revolving credit facilities, to be sufficient to meet our operating requirements, including purchase commitments, tax payments, including Tax Reform Act transition tax payments, and servicing our debt for the next twelve months. The ability to expand and grow our business in accordance with current plans, make acquisitions, meet long-term capital requirements beyond a twelve-month period and execute our capital return plan will depend on many factors, including the rate, if any, at which cash flow increases, our ability and willingness to pay for acquisitions with capital stock and the availability of public and private debt, including the ability to extend the maturity of or refinance our existing debt, and equity financing. We cannot be certain that additional financing, if required, will be available on terms and conditions acceptable to us, if at all.

 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 Management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our unaudited consolidated financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported for assets and liabilities, including the recoverability of tangible and intangible assets, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates. The most significant estimates relate to the recognition of revenue and profits, including the application of the cost-to-cost method of measuring progress to completion for certain fixed-price contracts, income taxes, business combinations and valuation of goodwill and other long-lived assets. We base our estimates on historical experience, current trends and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The actual amounts may differ from the estimates used in the preparation of the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements. For a discussion of our critical accounting estimates, see Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

The repurchase program does not have an expiration date and had a remaining balance of 1,377 million as of September 30, 2024.
