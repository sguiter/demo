NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

 September 30, 2024 

(25,000 Euros), as
well as additional patent applications for cash consideration of and share purchase warrants with a fair value of 
(Note 4). 

The Company s financial statements are prepared
consistent with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States applicable to a going concern. 

The Company has not developed a commercially viable
product, has not generated any significant revenue to date, and has incurred losses since inception, resulting in a net accumulated deficit
at September 30, 2024. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. 

The Company needs additional working capital to continue
its medical research or to be successful in any future business activities and continue to pay its liabilities. Therefore, continuation
of the Company as a going concern is dependent upon obtaining the additional working capital necessary to accomplish its objective. 
Management is presently engaged in seeking additional working capital through equity financing or related party loans. In addition, any
significant disruption of global financial markets, reducing our ability to access capital, could negatively affect our liquidity and
ability to continue operations. The exact impact is and will remain unknown and largely dependent upon future developments, including
but not limited to restrictions on the activities of our domestic and international suppliers and shipment of goods. 

The accompanying financial statements do not
include any adjustments to the recorded assets or liabilities that might be necessary should the Company fail in any of the above objectives
and is unable to operate for the coming year. 

stock options (September 30, 2023 ), and warrants (September 30, 2023 were not included in the computation of diluted loss per share for all periods presented because it was anti-dilutive due to the Company s
losses. 

Share-based compensation for non-employees in
exchange for goods and services used or consumed in an entity s own operations are also recorded at fair value on the measurement
date and accounted for in accordance with ASC 718. The measurement of share-based compensation is subject to periodic adjustment as the
underlying instruments vest. The fair value of stock options is estimated using the Black-Scholes Option Pricing Model and the compensation
charges are amortized over the vesting period.

 0.10 per share for a period of five years. The Patent Application Rights had a total fair value of 35,000, which was allocated as 10,000
to the cash consideration paid, with the remaining 25,000 being allocated to the warrant component of the overall consideration. The
Company incurred an additional 608,218 in direct costs relating to the Patent Application Rights, of which were incurred during
the nine month period ended September 30, 2024.

Patent Application Rights ). In exchange for the New Patent Application Rights, the Company agreed to pay 1 (paid). 
The Company incurred in direct costs relating to the New Patent Application Rights during the year ended December 31, 2016. 

The Company amortizes patents and licenses that have
been filed over their useful lives which range between to years. The costs of provisional patents and pending applications is

Gross Profit and Expenses 

The Company s net loss was 261,676 for the
nine month period ended September 30, 2024 compared to 303,007 for the nine month period ended September 30, 2023. The expenses
were primarily incurred for professional fees, consulting services related to the operations of the Company s business, research
and development and other general and administrative expenses. Significant changes from the prior nine month period ended September
30, 2024 include: 

General and administrative fees dropped by 41,429
from 85,018 to 43,589 primarily from a decrease in spending on social media advertising, and a planned reduction in market services
provided by the OTC market exchange. Additionally, there are no current year project expenses related to product development. 

Professional fees decreased by 9,934 from 108,581
to 98,647 as a result lower year -to-date audit and legal fees while accumulated accounting fees are unchanged from prior year. 

Research and development expenditures increased slightly
year over year with a change of 2,669 from 75,956 to 78,625 as the Company paid for molecule storage and study results. The company
continues to pursue research partners for cost sharing and engages institutes with grants available for continued studies on our patented
AAGP molecule. 

Share-based compensation increased to 1,354 for current
nine month period and Nil as at September 30, 2023 as a result stock options being granted to a consultant to the company.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

The following summarizes our balance sheet at September 30, 2024 and December
31, 2023:

 Cash 
 5,690 
 20,408 

Working Capital (deficiency) 
 (81,009 
 (23,238 

At September 30, 2024, we had 5,690 in cash and 6,740
in total current assets and a negative working capital equity position of (81,009). Based upon
our working capital equity as of September 30, 2024, we will require additional equity and/or debt financing in order to meet cash flow
projections and carry forward our business objectives. 

There can be no assurance that in the future we will
be able to raise capital from outside sources in sufficient amounts to fund our new business. The failure to secure adequate outside funding
would have an adverse effect on our plan of operation and results therefrom and a corresponding negative impact on stockholder liquidity. 

Sources and Uses of Cash 

Net Cash Used in Operating Activities 

Net cash used in operating activities fell by 120,715
from 298,523 to 177,808 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, and 2024, respectively. With the year over year change primarily
from a drop in company activity including marketing and research. 

Net Cash Used in Investing Activities 

Net cash used in investing activities was 52,910
for the nine month period ended September 30, 2024 while the Company had net cash used in investing activities of 34,631 for the comparative
period. The difference is attributable to expanded patent application costs for the three quarters of the current year. 

Net Cash Provided by Financing Activities 

Net cash provided by financing activities decreased
 104,000 from 320,000 to 216,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, and 2024, respectively. The decrease of funding from
private placements through the third quarter of 2024 reflects the focus on scaling back of operations and finding financial partners for
further research and development. 

Going Concern 

 The accompanying financial statements have been
prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States U.S. GAAP ), which contemplate
continuation of the Company as a going concern. The history of losses and the inability for the Company to make a profit from selling
a good or service has raised substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. In spite of the fact that the current
cash obligations of the Company are relatively minimal, given the cash position of the Company, we have very little cash to operate. We
intend to fund the Company and attempt to meet corporate obligations by selling common stock. However, the price and volume of the
Company s common stock is volatile. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

None. 

Contractual Obligations 

As a smaller reporting company, we are not required
to provide the information required by paragraph (a)(5) of this Item. 

Critical Accounting Policies 

The preparation of financial statements in conformity
with U.S. GAAP requires management to make a variety of estimates and assumptions that affect (i) the reported amounts of assets and liabilities
and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements, and (ii) the reported amounts of revenues
and expenses during the reporting periods covered by the financial statements. 

Our management routinely makes judgments and estimates
about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. As the number of variables and assumptions affecting the future resolution
of the uncertainties increase, these judgments become even more subjective and complex. Although we believe that our estimates and assumptions
are reasonable, actual results may differ significantly from these estimates. Changes in estimates and assumptions based upon actual results
may have a material impact on our results of operation and/or financial condition. Our significant accounting policies are disclosed in
Note 2 to the Financial Statements included in this Form 10-Q. 

While all of the significant accounting policies are
important to the Company s financial statements, the following accounting policies and the estimates derived there from have been
identified as being critical. 

19 

Share-Based Compensation 

The Company has granted warrants and options to purchase
shares of the Company s common stock to various parties for consulting services. The fair values of the warrants and options
issued have been estimated using the Black-Scholes Option Pricing Model. 

The Company accounts for stock compensation with persons
classified as employees for accounting purposes in accordance with ASC 718 Compensation Stock Compensation , which
recognizes awards at fair value on the date of grant and recognition of compensation over the service period for awards expected to vest. Cliff
Vesting is used and awards vest on the last day of the vesting period. The fair value of stock options is determined using the Black-Scholes
Option Pricing Model. The fair value of common shares issued for services is determined based on the Company s stock price on the
date of issuance. 

Share-based compensation for non-employees in exchange
for goods and services used or consumed in an entity s own operations are also recorded at fair value on the measurement date and
accounted for in accordance with ASC 718. The measurement of share-based compensation is subject to periodic adjustment as the underlying
instruments vest. The fair value of stock options is estimated using the Black-Scholes Option Pricing Model and the compensation charges
are amortized over the vesting period. 

Sales and Marketing 

The Company is currently not selling or marketing any products. 

Inflation 

Although management expects that our operations will
be influenced by general economic conditions, we do not believe that inflation had a material effect on our results of operations during
the three months ended September 30, 2024. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure
About Market Risk 

As a smaller reporting company as defined
by Item 10 of Regulation S-K, we are not required to provide information required by this item. 

Item 4: Controls and Procedures 

Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and
other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the 1934
Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s
rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information
required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the 1934 Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including our principal
executive officer and our principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Our management, under the direction of our Chief Executive
Officer (who is our principal executive officer), and Chief Financial Officer (who is our principal accounting officer) has evaluated
the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as required by 1934 Act Rule 13a-15(b) as of September 30, 2024 (the end of
the period covered by this report). Based on that evaluation, our principal executive officer and our principal accounting officer concluded
that these disclosure controls and procedures are not effective as of September 30, 2024 to provide reasonable assurance that information
required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the 1934 Act is accumulated and communicated to
management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure
and are not effective to provide reasonable assurance that such information is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the
time periods specified by the SEC s rules and forms. 

The Company, including its Chief Executive Officer
and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that its internal controls and procedures will prevent or detect all error and all fraud.
A control system, no matter how well conceived or operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of
the control system are met. 

Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

There were no changes in our internal control over
financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) promulgated by the SEC under the 1934 Act) during the nine months ended
September 30, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial
reporting.
