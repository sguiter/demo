(ii) million if aggregate net sales of all Products in the United States during a calendar year reach million and (iii)

will pay us royalties on net sales of all Products in the United States at a royalty rate of on the first million in annual
net sales and on annual net sales above million, subject to certain adjustments, for a period of years following the Closing
Date. The royalty rate will decrease to on a Product-by-Product basis upon the earlier to occur of (i) the expiration or revocation
of the last patent covering a Product and (ii) a generic version of a Product launching in the United States. Mayne Pharma will pay us
minimal annual royalties of million per year for years, adjusted for inflation at an annual rate of , subject to certain further
adjustments, including as described below. Upon the expiry of the -year royalty term, the licenses granted to Mayne Pharma under the
Mayne License Agreement will become a fully paid-up and royalty free license for the Licensed Products.

the contingent consideration set forth in the Mayne License Agreement, as amended. The acquisition of net working capital was determined
in accordance with the Transaction Agreement and included significant estimates which could change materially for a period of up to two
years following the Closing Date.

four quarterly payments that would have otherwise been payable pursuant to the Mayne License Agreement by an amount equal to thousand
per quarterly royalty payment plus interest calculated at per annum accruing from the Closing Date until the date such quarterly royalty
payment was paid to us. We and Mayne Pharma settled the million of consideration due to Mayne Pharma for the assumed obligations
under a long-term services agreement, including our minimum payment obligations thereunder. As the parties agreed, during the second quarter
of 2023 Mayne Pharma held back our royalty payment of million and we funded an additional million in August 2023 to settle the
original million payable.

 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 

The Company conducts regular reviews of the individual patents and
portfolios. As a result of this review, also based on input from its licensing partners in the three months ended June 30, 2024, the Company
determined it had an indicator of impairment, as it had abandoned the legal right and title to a portion of its granted patent portfolio
and had ceased pursuit of a portion of its pending patents based on input from its licensing partners. The Company recognized an impairment
loss of thousand related to those abandoned patents and applications, which is classified as an impairment of long-lived assets
on the Company s condensed consolidated statements of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

million at closing on
December 30, 2022, for the acquisition of net working capital, subject to certain adjustments as determined in accordance with the Transaction
Agreement. While the Transaction Agreement calls for much of the net working capital to be trued-up shortly after the Closing Date in
2023, for a period of one year following the Closing Date in the case of payer rebates and wholesale distributor fees and two years following
the Closing Date in the case for allowance for returns, net working capital amounts will be adjusted to arrive at final net working capital
under the Transaction Agreement. 

In September 2023, we increased certain accrual estimates including
increasing our working capital adjustment accrual by million for amounts anticipated to be owed under the Transaction Agreement.
In December 2023, we made a million payment to Mayne Pharma to settle certain working capital amounts that were required to
be trued-up shortly after the Closing Date, excluding the allowance for returns, allowance for payer rebates, and allowance for wholesale
distributor fees. Of the million, million increased the allowance for net working capital allowances remaining to be trued up. 

The Company s estimate of the allowance for payer rebates and
wholesale distributor fees was determined in accordance with the Transaction Agreement which establishes the process for the determination
of net working capital. In February 2024, the Company received Mayne Pharma s calculation of allowance for payer rebates and wholesale
distributor fees which differed significantly from the Company s estimate of the allowances. The Company intends
to resolve this matter through the dispute resolution process outlined in the Transaction Agreement. 

The Company believes its estimated allowances for payer rebates and
wholesale distributor fees are reasonable. The timing and outcome of this matter is uncertain at this point. As a result, the Company
cannot reasonably estimate a range of loss, and accordingly, the Company has not accrued any additional liability associated with Mayne
Pharma s allowance calculation for payer rebates and wholesale distributor fees. 

In addition, the Company has received information from Mayne
Pharma pertaining to the allowance for returns that differs from the Company s estimate of the allowance. As of September 30,
2024, the Company believes no additional accrual is required for amounts that may be owed for the allowance for returns, as the
Company cannot reasonably estimate a range of loss. The Company has not recorded any contingent gains or receivables for any such
allowances. Management continues to monitor the unresolved and pending net working capital items as changes to estimated amounts
owed or amounts due from Mayne Pharma may be material. 

Mayne Pharma has also made certain indemnification demands under
the Transaction Agreement, which the Company disputes. As of September 30, 2024, the Company believes no additional accrual is
required for such claims, as the Company cannot reasonably estimate a range of loss. 

11 

thousand in prepaid expenses and other current assets as of September 30, 2024, for the IMVEXXY Paragraph IV
legal proceeding since we believe that we will successfully prevail in this legal proceeding. Upon the successful conclusion of the legal
proceeding, the related capitalized legal costs will be reclassified to patents, in license rights and other intangible assets, net, in
the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets, and such costs will be amortized over the remaining useful life of the patents.
If we are unsuccessful in this legal proceeding, then the related capitalized legal costs for this legal preceding and any unamortized
IMVEXXY patent costs that were previously capitalized will be immediately expensed in the period in which we become aware of an unsuccessful
legal proceeding. 

In June 2024, Mayne received a Paragraph IV certification notice letter
(the Sun Notice Letter regarding an ANDA submitted to the FDA by Sun Pharma Inc. Sun Pharma ). The ANDA seeks
approval from the FDA to commercially manufacture, use, or sell a generic version of the 4 mcg and 10 mcg doses of IMVEXXY. In the Sun
Notice Letter, Sun Pharma alleges that the IMVEXXY Patents are invalid, unenforceable, and/or will not be infringed by Sun Pharma s
commercial manufacture, use, or sale of its proposed generic drug product. The IMVEXXY Patents identified in the Sun Notice Letter expire
in 2032 or 2033. In July 2024, we and Mayne Pharma filed a complaint for patent infringement against Sun Pharma in the United States District
Court for the District of New Jersey arising from Sun Pharma s ANDA filing with the FDA. We are seeking, among other relief, an
order that the effective date of any FDA approval of Sun Pharma s ANDA would be a date no earlier than the expiration of the IMVEXXY
Patents and equitable relief enjoining Sun Pharma from infringing the IMVEXXY Patents. 

Beginning on December 30, 2022 and per the Mayne License Agreement,
Mayne Pharma is responsible for all enforcement of our patents, including the responsibility for and costs of litigation discussed above
with respect to Teva and Sun Pharma. 

From time to time, we are involved in other litigations and proceedings
in the ordinary course of business. We are currently not involved in any other litigations and proceedings that we believe would have
a material effect on our condensed consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. 

Off-balance sheet arrangements 

As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 there were no off-balance
sheet arrangements that have had or are reasonably likely to have current or future effects on our financial condition, changes in financial
condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that we consider material.

Share-based payment compensation cost 

Share-based payment compensation expense for PSUs is based on 
vesting which was a part of the termination benefits for all employees who were terminated in 2022. We recorded share-based payment award
compensation costs related to previously issued options, RSU and PSUs, as well as shares of common stock issued under our employee stock
purchase plan ESPP totaling thousand and thousand for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively,
and thousand and thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 

As of September 30, 2024, we had thousand of unrecognized share-based
payment award compensation cost related to unvested options, RSUs and PSUs as well as shares issuable under our ESPP, which may be adjusted
for future changes in forfeitures and is included as additional paid-in capital in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets.
No tax benefit was realized due to a continued pattern of net losses. The unrecognized compensation cost of thousand is expected to
be recognized as share-based payment award compensation over a weighted average period of years.

year reach million, (ii) million if aggregate net sales of all Products in the United States during a calendar year reach
 million and (iii) million if aggregate net sales of all Products in the United States during a calendar year reach 
million. Further, Mayne Pharma will pay to the Company royalties on net sales of all Products in the United States at a royalty rate of
 on the first million in annual net sales and on annual net sales above million, subject to certain adjustments, for
a period of years following the Closing Date. The royalty rate will decrease to on a Product-by-Product basis upon the earlier
to occur of (i) the expiration or revocation of the last patent covering a Product and (ii) a generic version of a Product launching in
the United States. Mayne Pharma will pay to the Company minimal annual royalties of million per year for years, adjusted for inflation
at an annual rate of , subject to certain further adjustments. Upon the expiry of the -year royalty
term, the licenses granted to Mayne Pharma under the Mayne License Agreement will become a fully paid-up and royalty free license for
the Licensed Products.

Our company 

TherapeuticsMD was previously a women s healthcare company with
a mission of creating and commercializing innovative products to support the lifespan of women from pregnancy prevention through menopause.
In December 2022, we changed our business to become a pharmaceutical royalty company, primarily collecting royalties from our licensees.
We are no longer engaged in research and development or commercial operations. On December 30, 2022 (the Closing Date ),
we completed a transaction (the Mayne Transaction with Mayne Pharma LLC, a Delaware limited liability company Mayne
Pharma and subsidiary of Mayne Pharma Group Limited, an Australian public company, pursuant to which we (i) granted Mayne Pharma
an exclusive license to commercialize IMVEXXY, BIJUVA and prescription prenatal vitamin products sold under the BocaGreenMD and vitaMedMD
brands (collectively, the Licensed Products in the United States and its possessions and territories, (ii) assigned to
Mayne Pharma our exclusive license to commercialize ANNOVERA (together with the Licensed Products, collectively, the Products in the United States and its possessions and territories, and (iii) sold certain other assets to Mayne Pharma in connection therewith. 

17 

Pursuant to a License Agreement, dated December 4, 2022, between TherapeuticsMD
and Mayne Pharma (the Mayne License Agreement ), we granted Mayne Pharma, on the Closing Date, (i) an exclusive, sublicensable,
perpetual, irrevocable license to research, develop, register, manufacture, have manufactured, market, sell, use, and commercialize the
Licensed Products in the United States and its possessions and territories and (ii) an exclusive, sublicensable, perpetual, irrevocable
license to manufacture, have manufactured, import and have imported the Licensed Products outside the United States for commercialization
in the United States and its possessions and territories. Pursuant to the Mayne License Agreement, Mayne Pharma will pay us one-time,
milestone payments of each of (i) 5.0 million if aggregate net sales of all Products in the United States during a calendar year reach
 100.0 million, (ii) 10.0 million if aggregate net sales of all Products in the United States during a calendar year reach 200.0 million
and (iii) 15.0 million if aggregate net sales of all Products in the United States during a calendar year reach 300.0 million. Further,
Mayne Pharma will pay us royalties on net sales of all Products in the United States at a royalty rate of 8.0 on the first 80 million
in annual net sales and 7.5 on annual net sales above 80.0 million, subject to certain adjustments, for a period of 20 years following
the Closing Date. The royalty rate will decrease to 2.0 on a Product-by-Product basis upon the earlier to occur of (i) the expiration
or revocation of the last patent covering a Product and (ii) a generic version of a Product launching in the United States. Mayne Pharma
will pay us minimum annual royalties of 3.0 million per year for 12 years, adjusted for inflation at an annual rate of 3 , subject to
certain further adjustments, including as described below (the Minimum Annual Royalty ). Upon the expiry of the 20-year royalty
term, the licenses granted to Mayne Pharma under the Mayne License Agreement will become a fully paid-up and royalty free license for
the Licensed Products. 

Pursuant to a Transaction Agreement, dated December 4, 2022, between
TherapeuticsMD and Mayne Pharma (the Transaction Agreement ), we sold to Mayne Pharma, at closing, certain assets for Mayne
Pharma to commercialize the Products in the United States, including our exclusive license from the Population Council to commercialize
ANNOVERA (the Transferred Assets ). 

The total consideration from Mayne Pharma to us for the purchase of
the Transferred Assets and the grant of the licenses under the Mayne License Agreement was (i) a cash payment of 140.0 million at closing,
(ii) a cash payment of approximately 12.1 million at closing for the acquisition of net working capital as determined in accordance with
the Transaction Agreement and subject to certain adjustments, (iii) a cash payment of approximately 1.0 million at closing for prepaid
royalties in connection with the Mayne License Agreement Amendment (as defined below) and (iv) the right to receive the contingent consideration
set forth in the Mayne License Agreement, as amended. The acquisition of net working capital was determined in accordance with the Transaction
Agreement and included significant estimates which could change materially for a period of up to two years following the Closing Date. 

On the Closing Date, TherapeuticsMD and Mayne Pharma entered into Amendment
No. 1 to the Mayne License Agreement (the Mayne License Agreement Amendment ). Pursuant to the Mayne License Agreement Amendment,
Mayne Pharma agreed to pay us approximately 1.0 million in prepaid royalties on the Closing Date. The prepaid royalties reduced the first
four quarterly payments that would have otherwise been payable pursuant to the Mayne License Agreement by an amount equal to 257 thousand
per quarterly royalty payment plus interest calculated at 19 per annum accruing from the Closing Date until the date such quarterly royalty
payment was paid to us. We and Mayne Pharma settled the 1.5 million of consideration due to Mayne for the assumed obligations under a
long-term services agreement, including our minimum payment obligations thereunder. As the parties agreed, during the second quarter of
2023, Mayne Parma held back our royalty payment of 0.6 million and we funded an additional 0.9 million in August 2023 to settle the
original 1.5 million payable. 

This action represented a shift in our business and therefore, the
related assets and liabilities associated with commercial operations are classified as discontinued operations on our condensed consolidated
balance sheets and the results of operations have been presented as discontinued operations within our condensed consolidated statements
of operations for all periods presented. See Note 2 Discontinued Operations to the condensed consolidated financial statements
included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further details. 

18 

We also have license agreements with strategic partners to commercialize
IMVEXXY and BIJUVA outside of the U.S. 

In July 2018, we entered into a license and supply agreement (the Knight License Agreement with Knight Therapeutics Inc. Knight pursuant to which we granted Knight an exclusive license to commercialize IMVEXXY and BIJUVA in Canada and Israel. Knight obtained regulatory approval for IMVEXXY and BIJUVA and began commercialization efforts in 2024. 

In September 2019, we entered into an exclusive license and supply agreement (the Theramex License Agreement with Theramex HQ UK Limited Theramex to commercialize IMVEXXY and BIJUVA outside of the U.S., excluding Canada and Israel. In 2021, Theramex secured regulatory approval for BIJUVA in certain European countries and began commercialization efforts in those countries. 

In connection with our transformation into a pharmaceutical royalty
company, the termination of our executive management team (except for Mr. Marlan Walker, our former General Counsel and current Chief
Executive Officer) and all other employees was completed by December 31, 2022. Severance obligations for all employees other than executive
officers were paid in full in the first quarter of 2023 and severance obligations for terminated executive officers have been paid in
accordance with their employment agreements and separation agreements as previously disclosed. As of December 31, 2023 and September 30,
2024, we employed one full-time employee primarily engaged in an executive position. We have engaged external consultants, including certain
former members of our management team, who support our relationship with current partners and assist with certain financial, legal and
regulatory matters and the continued wind-down of our historical business operations. 

Going concern 

Following the transaction with Mayne Pharma, our primary source of
revenue is from royalties on products licensed to pharmaceutical organizations that possess commercial capabilities in the relevant territories.
We may need to raise additional capital to provide additional liquidity to fund our operations until we become cash flow positive. To
address our capital needs, we may pursue various equity and debt financing and other alternatives. The equity financing alternatives may
include the private placement of equity, equity-linked, or other similar instruments or obligations with one or more investors, lenders,
or other institutional counterparties or an underwritten public equity or equity-linked securities offering. Our ability to sell equity
securities may be limited by market conditions, including the market price of our common stock, and our available authorized shares. 

To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of
such securities, the ownership interests of our existing stockholders will be diluted, and the terms of these new securities may include
liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of our existing stockholders. If we are not successful in obtaining
additional financing, we could be forced to discontinue or curtail our business operations, sell assets at unfavorable prices, or merge,
consolidate, or combine with a company with greater financial resources in a transaction that might be unfavorable to us. 

On May 1, 2023, we entered into a Subscription Agreement (the Subscription
Agreement with Rubric Capital Management LP Rubric ), pursuant to which we agreed to sell to Rubric, or one or more
of its affiliates, up to an aggregate of 5,000,000 shares of our common stock, par value 0.001 per share (our Common Stock ),
from time to time during the term of the Subscription Agreement in separate draw-downs at our election. On June 29, 2023, we issued and
sold 312,525 shares of Common Stock at a price per share equal to 3.6797 pursuant to the Subscription Agreement. We received gross proceeds
of 1.15 million from the draw down, before expenses. On November 15, 2023, Rubric drew down an additional 877,192 shares of Common Stock
at a price per share equal to 2.2761. We received gross proceeds of 2.0 million from the drawdown, before expenses. 

Mayne Pharma paid us approximately 12.1 million at closing on
December 30, 2022, for the acquisition of net working capital, subject to certain adjustments as determined in accordance with the Transaction
Agreement. While the Transaction Agreement calls for much of the net working capital to be trued-up shortly after the Closing Date in
2023, for a period of one year following the Closing Date in the case of payer rebates and wholesale distributor fees and two years following
the Closing Date in the case for allowance for returns, net working capital amounts will be adjusted to arrive at final net working capital
under the Transaction Agreement. 

19 

In September 2023, we revised certain accrual estimates including increasing
our working capital adjustment accrual from 3.5 million to 5.5 million for amounts anticipated to be owed under the Transaction
Agreement. In December 2023, we made a 5.5 million payment to Mayne Pharma to settle certain working capital amounts that were required
to be trued-up shortly after the Closing Date, excluding the allowance for returns, allowance for payer rebates, and allowance for wholesale
distributor fees. 

The Company s estimate of the allowance for payer rebates and
wholesale distributor fees was determined in accordance with the Transaction Agreement which establishes the process for the determination
of net working capital. In February 2024, the Company received Mayne Pharma s calculation of allowance for payer rebates and wholesale
distributor fees which differed significantly from the Company s estimate of the allowances. The Company intends
to resolve this matter through the dispute resolution process outlined in the Transaction Agreement. 

The Company believes its estimated allowances
for payer rebates and wholesale distributor fees are reasonable. The timing and outcome of this matter is uncertain at this point. As
a result, the Company cannot reasonably estimate a range of loss, and accordingly, the Company has not accrued any additional liability
associated with Mayne Pharma s allowance calculation for payer rebates and wholesale distributor fees. 

In addition, the Company has received information from Mayne
Pharma pertaining to the allowance for returns that differs from the Company s estimate of the allowance. As of September 30,
2024, the Company believes no additional accrual is required for amounts that may be owed for the allowance for returns under the
Transaction Agreement, as the Company cannot reasonably estimate a range of loss. The Company has not recorded any contingent gains
or receivables for any such allowances. Management continues to monitor the unresolved and pending net working capital items as
changes to estimated amounts owed or amounts due from Mayne Pharma may be material. 

If Mayne Pharma s sales of Licensed
Products grow more slowly than expected or decline, if the net working capital settlement with Mayne Pharma under the Transaction Agreement
is greater than our current estimates, if we are unsuccessful with future financings or the supply chains related to the third-party contract
manufacturers are worse than we anticipate, our existing cash reserves may be insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements. The
potential impact of these factors in conjunction with the uncertainty of the capital markets raises substantial doubt about our ability
to continue as a going concern for the next twelve months from the issuance of these financial statements. 

The accompanying consolidated financial statements
do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if we are unable to continue as a going concern. 

Portfolio of our royalty-bearing products 

In December 2022, we changed our business to become a pharmaceutical
royalty company, currently receiving royalties on products licensed to pharmaceutical organizations that possess commercial capabilities
in the relevant territories. On December 30, 2022, we granted an exclusive license to commercialize IMVEXXY, BIJUVA, and prescription
prenatal vitamin products sold under the BocaGreenMD and vitaMedMD brands and assigning our exclusive license to commercialize ANNOVERA
to Mayne Pharma. 

IMVEXXY (estradiol vaginal inserts), 4- g and 10- g 

This pharmaceutical product is for the treatment of moderate-to-severe
dyspareunia (vaginal pain associated with sexual activity), a symptom of vulvar and vaginal atrophy due to menopause. 

On December 30, 2022, we granted an exclusive license to commercialize
IMVEXXY in the United States and its possessions and territories to Mayne Pharma. We also have entered into licensing agreements with
third parties to market and sell IMVEXXY outside of the U.S. We entered into the Knight License Agreement, with Knight pursuant to which,
we granted Knight an exclusive license to commercialize IMVEXXY in Canada and Israel. We entered into the Theramex License Agreement with
Theramex HQ UK Limited Theramex pursuant to which we granted Theramex an exclusive license to commercialize IMVEXXY for
human use outside of the U.S., except for Canada and Israel. As of September 30, 2024, no IMVEXXY sales had been made through the Theramex
licensing agreement. 

20 

BIJUVA (estradiol and progesterone) capsules, 1 mg/100 mg 

This pharmaceutical product is the first and only FDA approved bioidentical
hormone therapy combination of estradiol and progesterone in a single, oral capsule for the treatment of moderate-to-severe vasomotor
symptoms (commonly known as hot flashes or flushes) due to menopause in women with a uterus. 

On December 30, 2022, we granted an exclusive license to commercialize
BIJUVA in the United States and its possessions and territories to Mayne Pharma. We also have entered into the Knight License Agreement
with Knight pursuant to which we granted Knight an exclusive license to commercialize BIJUVA in Canada and Israel. We have entered into
the Theramex License Agreement with Theramex pursuant to which we granted Theramex an exclusive license to commercialize BIJUVA for human
use outside of the U.S., except for Canada and Israel. 

ANNOVERA (segesterone acetate SA and ethinyl estradiol EE vaginal system) 

On December 30, 2022, we assigned our exclusive license to commercialize
ANNOVERA to Mayne Pharma. This pharmaceutical product is a one-year ring-shaped contraceptive vaginal system CVS and the
first and only patient-controlled, procedure-free, reversible prescription contraceptive that can prevent pregnancy for up to a total
of 13 cycles (one year). ANNOVERA is commercially sold in the U.S. pursuant to the terms of the Population Council License Agreement. 

Prenatal vitamin products 

On December 30, 2022, we granted an exclusive license to commercialize,
in the United States and its possessions and territories, our prescription prenatal vitamin product lines under our vitaMedMD brand name
and authorized generic formulations of some of our prescription prenatal vitamin products under our BocaGreenMD Prenatal name to Mayne
Pharma. 

Results of operations 

As part of the transformation that included the Mayne License Agreement,
historical results of commercial operations have been reflected as discontinued operations in our condensed consolidated financial statements
for all periods prior to the Closing Date. Assets and liabilities associated with the commercial business are classified as assets and
liabilities of discontinued operations in our condensed consolidated balance sheets. Additional disclosures regarding discontinued operations
are provided in Note 2 to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report. 

The discussion below, and the revenues and expenses discussed below,
are based on, and relate to, our continuing operations.

Revenue. As part of our transformation and the Mayne License
Agreement, historical results of commercial operations have been reflected as discontinued operations in the condensed consolidated financial
statements for all periods presented. 

We recorded 547 thousand in license revenue for the third quarter of
2024, primarily from the Mayne License Agreement, an increase of 600 thousand, compared to (53) thousand in license revenue for
the third quarter of 2023. The increase is primarily attributable to changes in sales of licensed products. Reported negative license
revenue of 53) thousand in the third quarter of 2023 was due to product sales adjustments reported by our licensees. 

Operating expenses . Total operating expenses for the third quarter
of 2024 were 1,406 thousand, a decrease of 314 thousand, or 18.3 , compared to the third quarter of 2023. This decrease was due to the
further optimization of our business through the reduction of costs following our transition to a royalty-based business. 

Selling, general and administrative. Selling, general and administrative
expenses were 1,310 thousand for the third quarter of 2024, a decrease of 280 thousand, or 17.6 , compared to the third quarter of 2023.
This decrease was due to the increased efficiencies realized following our transition to a royalty-based business. 

Depreciation amortization. Depreciation and
amortization expense was 96 thousand for the third quarter of 2024, a decrease of 34 thousand, or 26.2 , compared to the third
quarter of 2023. In the 2024 period, this balance is entirely comprised of amortization of license rights and intangible assets. 

Loss from operations. In the third quarter of 2024, we had a
loss from operations of 859 thousand, as compared to a loss from operations of 1,773 thousand for the third quarter of 2023. This
change reflects the streamlining of our business and increased efficiencies realized as a royalty-based business. 

22 

Other income (expense), net . During the third quarter of
2024, we had other income of 292 thousand compared to other income of 339 thousand in the third quarter of 2023. Other income in
the 2024 period was mainly comprised of interest income, while other income in the prior year period was mainly comprised of
royalties. 

Provision for income taxes . During the third quarter of 2024
and 2023, we recorded no provision for income taxes for continuing operations. 

Net loss from continuing operations . For the third quarter of
2024, we had a net loss of 567 thousand, or 0.05 per basic and diluted common share,
compared to a net loss of 1,434 thousand, or 0.13 per basic and diluted common share, for the third quarter of 2023. 

Discontinued Operations Net loss from discontinued operations
was 42 thousand for the third quarter of 2024, compared to a net loss from discontinued operations of 1,944 thousand for the third quarter
of 2023.

Revenue . As part of our transformation and the Mayne License
Agreement, historical results of commercial operations have been reflected as discontinued operations in the condensed consolidated financial
statements for all periods presented. 

We recorded 1,094 thousand in
license revenue for the first nine months of 2024, primarily from the Mayne License Agreement, an increase of 294
thousand, or 36.8 , compared to 800 thousand in license revenue for the first nine months of 2023. The increase is primarily attributable
to changes in sales of licensed products. 

23 

Operating expenses . Total operating expenses for the first nine
months of 2024 were 5,535 thousand, a decrease of 2,177 thousand, or 28.2 , compared to the first nine months of 2023. This decrease
was due to the further optimization of our business through the reduction of costs following our transition to a royalty-based business
and is partially off-set by the patent impairment recognized in the second quarter of 2024. 

Selling, general and administrative. Selling, general and administrative
expenses were 3,865 thousand for the first nine months of 2024, a decrease of 3,562 thousand, or 48.0 , compared to the first nine months
of 2023. This decrease was due to the increased efficiencies realized following our transition to a royalty-based business. 

Depreciation amortization. Depreciation and amortization
expense was 409 thousand for the first nine months of 2024, an increase of 124 thousand, or 43.5 , compared to the first nine months
of 2023. In the 2024 period, this balance is entirely comprised of amortization of license rights and intangible assets. 

Loss from operations. In the first nine months of 2024, we had
a loss from operations of 4,441 thousand, as compared to a loss from operations of 6,912 thousand for the first nine months of 2023.
This change reflects the streamlining of our business and increased efficiencies realized as a royalty-based business. 

Other income, net . During the first nine months of 2024, we
had other income of 2,015 thousand compared to other income of 754 thousand in the first nine months of 2023. The difference is mainly
due to a 1,250 thousand one-time payment the Company received from its sublessee on its early termination on the sublease, which
was recognized in the second quarter of 2024. Royalties reported as other income for intellectual
property licensed by us totaled approximately 660 thousand in the first nine months of 2024. 

Provision for income taxes . During the first nine months of
2024 and 2023, we recorded no provision for income taxes for continuing operations. 

Net loss from continuing operations . For the first nine months
of 2024, we had a net loss of 2,426 thousand , or 0.21
per basic and diluted common share, compared to a net loss of 6,158 thousand, or 0.60 per basic and diluted common share, for
the first nine months of 2023. 

Discontinued Operations - Net loss from discontinued operations
was 7 thousand for the first nine months of 2024, compared to a net loss from discontinued operations of 3,237 thousand for the first
nine months of 2023. This change reflects the continued wind-down of our legacy business. 

For additional information, see Note 2 - Discontinued Operations, in
the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly Report. 

Liquidity and capital resources 

Our primary use of cash is to fund our continued operations. We have
funded our operations primarily through public offerings of our common stock and private placements of equity and debt securities, the
divestiture of our former subsidiary vitaCare, and the transactions with Mayne Pharma. As of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash
equivalents totaling 5,047 thousand. We maintain cash at financial institutions that at times may exceed the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation insured limits of 250 thousand per bank. We have never experienced any losses related to these funds. 

Mayne Pharma License Agreement 

On December 30, 2022, we granted Mayne Pharma (i) an exclusive, sublicensable,
perpetual, irrevocable license to research, develop, register, manufacture, have manufactured, market, sell, use, and commercialize the
Licensed Products in the United States and its possessions and territories and (ii) an exclusive, sublicensable, perpetual, irrevocable
license to manufacture, have manufactured, import and have imported the Licensed Products outside the United States for commercialization
in the United States and its possessions and territories. The total consideration from Mayne Pharma to us under the Mayne License Agreement
consisted of (i) a cash payment of 140.0 million at closing, (ii) a cash payment of approximately 12.1 million at closing for the acquisition
of net working capital as determined in accordance with the transaction agreement dated December 4, 2022, and subject to certain adjustments,
(iii) a cash payment of approximately 1.0 million at closing for prepaid royalties in connection with the Mayne License Agreement Amendment
and (iv) the right to receive the contingent consideration set forth in the Mayne License Agreement, as amended. 

24 

Pursuant to the Mayne License Agreement, Mayne Pharma will pay us one-time,
milestone payments of each of (i) 5.0 million if aggregate net sales of all Products in the United States during a calendar year reach
 100.0 million, (ii) 10.0 million if aggregate net sales of all Products in the United States during a calendar year reach 200.0 million
and (iii) 15.0 million if aggregate net sales of all Products in the United States during a calendar year reach 300.0 million. Further,
Mayne Pharma will pay us royalties on net sales of all Products in the United States at a royalty rate of 8.0 on the first 80 million
in annual net sales and 7.5 on annual net sales above 80.0 million, subject to certain adjustments, for a period of 20 years following
the Closing Date. The royalty rate will decrease to 2.0 on a Product-by-Product basis upon the earlier to occur of (i) the expiration
or revocation of the last patent covering a Product and (ii) a generic version of a Product launching in the United States. Mayne Pharma
will pay us minimum annual royalties of 3.0 million per year for 12 years, adjusted for inflation at an annual rate of 3 , subject to
certain further adjustments, including as described below. Upon the expiry of the 20-year royalty term, the licenses granted to Mayne
Pharma under the Mayne License Agreement will become a fully paid-up and royalty free license for the Licensed Products. 

Subscription Agreement with Rubric Capital Management LP 

On May 1, 2023, we entered into the Subscription Agreement with Rubric,
pursuant to which we agreed to sell to Rubric, or one or more of its affiliates, up to an aggregate of 5,000,000 shares of Common Stock,
from time to time during the term of the Subscription Agreement in separate drawdowns at our election, at a purchase price of the five-day
volume-weighted average price of our common stock at the time of the sale of such shares, at an aggregate purchase price of up to 5,000,000
(collectively, the Private Placement ). 

The initial draw down occurred on June 29, 2023 consisting of a sale
of 312,525 shares of Common Stock at a price per share equal to 3.6797. We received gross proceeds of 1.15 million from the drawdown,
before expenses. On November 15, 2023 Rubric drew down an additional 877,192 shares of Common Stock at a price per share equal to 2.2761.
We received gross proceeds of 2.0 million from the drawdown, before expenses. 

Managed Client Agreement with IWG 

On September 30, 2024 (the Commencement Date ), we entered
into a Managed Client Agreement (the Managed Client Agreement with RGN-MCA Florida VI, LLC IWG pursuant
to which IWG agreed to provide managed services for flexible workspaces under the HQ brand for 21,330 square feet of our
office spaces located at 951 Yamato Road, Boca Raton, Florida 33431 (the Premises ). The Managed Client Agreement is subject
to termination by us or IWG if either party does not approve the specification, plans and drawings for the fit out of the Premises on
or before the date that is 120 days after the Commencement Date. 

See Going Concern above for further discussion related
to our ability to generate and obtain adequate amounts of cash to meet our liquidity needs and our plans to satisfy our such needs
in the short-term and in the long-term. As a result, there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern for the
next twelve months from the issuance of these financial statements. 

Cash flows 

The following table reflects the major categories of cash flows for
each of the periods (in thousands). 

Nine Months Ended

Operating Activities from continuing operations . For the first
nine months of 2024, net cash provided by operating activities was 1,153 thousand, compared to net cash used in operating activities
of 18,121 thousand for the first nine months of 2023. This change of 19,274 thousand was primarily due to a 3,732 thousand decrease
in our net loss from continuing operations following our transition from a manufacturing and commercialization business to a royalty-based
business combined with the pay-down of current liabilities in the prior-year period. 

25 

Financing Activities from continuing operations. For the
first nine months of 2024, there was no cash received from financing activities, compared to net cash received from financing activities
of 1,149 thousand for the first nine months of 2023, reflecting the sale of common stock during the first nine months of 2023. 

Net cash used in discontinued operations. Net cash used in operating
activities from discontinued operations for the first nine months of 2024 was 433 thousand as compared to net cash used in operating
activities of 22,179 thousand for the first nine months of 2023. This change relates primarily to a decrease in expenses incurred and
the payment of current liabilities associated with our transition from a manufacturing and commercialization business to a royalty-based
business. 

For additional details, see the condensed consolidated statements of
cash flows in Item 1, Financial Statements, appearing elsewhere in this 10-Q Report. 

Other liquidity measures 

Receivable from Mayne . On December 30, 2022, Mayne Pharma acquired
our accounts receivable balance of approximately 29.3 million which is subject to certain working capital adjustments. As of September
30, 2024, we had a royalty receivable of 3,160 thousand relating to the short-term portion
of receivable from Mayne Pharma and 16,610 thousand relating to the long-term portion of
royalty receivable which includes royalties recognized from the Minimum Annual Royalty. See Note 1 Business, basis of presentation, new
accounting standards and summary of significant accounting policies (Revenue Recognition) to the consolidated financial statements included
in our 2023 10-K Report. 

Inventory. On December 30, 2022, Mayne Pharma acquired our inventory
balance of approximately 6.6 million, which is subject to certain net working capital adjustments. 

Contractual obligations, off-balance sheet arrangements and purchase
commitments and employment agreements 

Our contractual obligations and off-balance sheet arrangements are
set forth below. For additional information on any of the following and other obligations and arrangements, see Note 6. Commitments
and Contingencies to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this 10-Q Report. 

In the ordinary course of business, we enter into agreements with third
parties that include indemnification provisions, which, in our judgment, are normal and customary for companies in our industry sector.
Pursuant to these agreements, we agree to indemnify, hold harmless, and reimburse indemnified parties for losses suffered or omitted by
us. The maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification provisions is sometimes unlimited.
We have not incurred material costs to defend lawsuits or settle claims related to these indemnification provisions. As a result, the
estimated fair value of liabilities relating to these provisions is minimal. Accordingly, we had no liabilities recorded for these provisions
as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 

In the normal course of business, we may be confronted with issues
or events that may result in contingent liability. These generally relate to lawsuits, claims, environmental actions, or the actions of
various regulatory agencies. We consult with counsel and other appropriate experts to assess the claim. If, in our opinion, we have incurred
a probable loss as set forth by U.S. GAAP, an estimate is made of the loss and the appropriate accounting entries are reflected in our
condensed consolidated financial statements. 

Critical accounting policies and estimates 

Management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition
and results of operations are based upon our condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this 10-Q Report, which
has been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and SEC rules and regulations related to interim financial reporting. We make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts on our condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes as of the date
of the condensed consolidated financial statements. The critical accounting policies and estimates used are disclosed in Item 7 
Management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations Critical accounting policies and estimates
in our 2023 10-K Report.

Item 3. Quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market
risk 

As a smaller reporting company, as defined by Rule 12b-2
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), and pursuant to Instruction 6 to Item 201(e) of Regulation
S-K, we are not required to provide this information. 

Item 4. Controls and procedures 

Management s evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures

Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information
required to be disclosed in the reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange
Act ), is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time period specified in the SEC s rules and forms and
is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate,
in order to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Our Chief Executive Officer evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure
controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this
10-Q Report. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end
of the period covered by this 10-Q Report were effective in providing reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by
us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in the SEC s rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer
and Principal Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Our Chief Executive Officer does not expect that our disclosure controls
and procedures or our internal controls will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated,
can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control
system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs.
Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control
issues, misstatements, errors, and instances of fraud, if any, within our Company have been or will be prevented or detected. Further,
internal controls may become inadequate as a result of changes in conditions, or through the deterioration of the degree of compliance
with policies or procedures. 

Changes in internal controls over financial reporting 

In connection with our transformation into a pharmaceutical royalty
company, we terminated our executive management team and all other employees, except for our former General Counsel and current Chief
Executive Officer. As of September 30, 2024, we employed one full-time employee primarily engaged in an executive position. We have engaged
external consultants who support our relationship with current partners and assist with certain financial, legal and regulatory matters
and the continued wind-down of our historical commercial business operations. As a result of these changes, we have updated our risk assessment
and design of internal controls over financial reporting that align with reduced transaction volume and reliance on external consultants
to manage the day-to-day operations of the Company. The Company is and will continue to evaluate changes to processes, information technology
systems and other components of internal controls over financial reporting as part of its ongoing business transformation activities,
and as a result, controls may be periodically changed. The Company believes, however, that it will be able to maintain sufficient controls
over its financial reporting throughout this transformation process. 

During the first quarter of fiscal year 2024, we deployed a new ERP system
which is anticipated to enhance our operating and financial processes over time. Processes and internal controls have been updated and
are consistent with our internal control framework, and we have evaluated the operating effectiveness of related key controls. Control
processes continue to be evaluated to give appropriate consideration of modifications needed to maintain the effectiveness of internal
controls over financial reporting.

Part II - Other Information 

Item 1. Legal proceedings 

From time to time, we are involved in litigation and proceedings in
the ordinary course of our business. Other than the legal proceedings disclosed in Note 6, Commitments and contingencies in Part I, Item
1, Financial Statements, appearing elsewhere in this 10-Q Report, we are not involved in any legal proceeding that we believe would have
a material effect on our business or financial condition. 

Item 1A. Risk factors 

Our business, financial condition and operating results can be affected
by a number of factors, whether currently known or unknown, including but not limited to those described in Part I, Item 1A of the 2023
10-K Report under the heading Risk Factors, any one or more of which could, directly or indirectly, cause our actual financial
condition and operating results to vary materially from past, or from anticipated future, financial condition and operating results. Any
of these factors, in whole or in part, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and
stock price. There have been no material changes to our risk factors since the 2023 10-K Report. 

Item 2. Unregistered sales of equity securities and use of proceeds

None. 

Item 3. Defaults upon senior securities 

None. 

Item 4. Mine safety disclosures 

None. 

Item 5. Other information

directors or officers or any Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement or non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement (as such terms
are defined in Item 408 of Regulation S-K).
