 Forward-looking statements 
 
 Unless the context otherwise requires, all references to Energy Focus, we, us, our, our company, or the Company refer to Energy Focus, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and its consolidated subsidiary for the applicable periods, considered as a single enterprise. 
 This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (this Quarterly Report includes statements that express our opinions, expectations, beliefs, plans, objectives, assumptions or projections regarding future events or future results and therefore are, or may be deemed to be, forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ). These forward-looking statements can generally be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology, including the terms believes, estimates, anticipates, expects, feels, seeks, forecasts, projects, intends, plans, may, will, should, could or would or, in each case, their negative or other variations or comparable terminology. These forward-looking statements include all matters that are not historical facts. They appear in a number of places throughout this Quarterly Report and include statements regarding our intentions, beliefs, or current expectations concerning, among other things, our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, prospects, growth, strategies, capital expenditures, and the industry in which we operate. 
 By their nature, forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties because they relate to events and depend on circumstances that may or may not occur in the future. Although we base these forward-looking statements on assumptions that we believe are reasonable when made in light of information currently available to us, we caution you that forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and that our actual results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, and industry developments may differ materially from statements made in or suggested by the forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report. In addition, even if our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, and industry developments are consistent with the forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report, those results or developments may not be indicative of results or developments in subsequent periods. 
 We believe that important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, the risks and uncertainties outlined under Risk Factors under Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 and other matters described in this Quarterly Report and our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission generally. Some of these factors include: 
 our need for and ability to obtain additional financing in the near term, on acceptable terms or at all, to continue our operations; 
 our ability to maintain compliance with the continued listing standards of The Nasdaq Stock Market Nasdaq 
 our ability to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time; 
 our ability to realize synergies with our strategic investor; 
 instability in the U.S. and global economies and business interruptions experienced by us, our customers and our suppliers; 
 the competitiveness and market acceptance of our light-emitting diode LED lighting and control technologies and products; 
 our ability to compete effectively against companies with lower prices or cost structures, greater resources, or more rapid development capabilities, and new competitors in our target markets; 
 our ability to extend our product portfolio into new applications and end markets; 
 our ability to increase demand in our targeted markets and to manage sales cycles that are difficult to predict and may span several quarters; 
 the timing of large customer orders, significant expenses and fluctuations between demand and capacity as we manage inventory and invest in growth opportunities; 
 our ability to successfully scale our network of sales representatives, agents, distributors and other channel partners to compete with the sales reach of larger, established competitors; 
 our ability to implement plans to increase sales and control expenses; 
 our reliance on a limited number of customers for a significant portion of our revenue, and our ability to maintain or grow such sales levels; 
 our ability to add new customers to reduce customer concentration; 
 our ability to attract and retain a new chief financial officer; 
 our ability to manage the size of our workforce while continuing to attract, develop and retain qualified personnel, and to do so in a timely manner; 
 2 

our ability to diversify our reliance on a limited number of third-party suppliers and development partners, our ability to manage third-party product development and obtain critical components and finished products on acceptable terms and of acceptable quality despite ongoing global supply chain challenges, and the impact of our fluctuating demand on the stability of such suppliers; 
 our ability to timely, efficiently and cost-effectively transport products from our third-party suppliers by ocean marine and other logistics channels despite global supply chain and logistics disruptions; 
 the impact of any type of legal inquiry, claim or dispute; 
 the macro-economic conditions, including rising interest rates and recessionary trends, in the United States and in other markets in which we operate or secure products, which could affect our ability to obtain raw materials, component parts, freight, energy, labor, and sourced finished goods in a timely and cost-effective manner; 
 our dependence on military maritime customers and on the levels and timing of government funding available to such customers, as well as the funding resources of our other customers in the public sector and commercial markets; 
 business interruptions resulting from geopolitical actions such as war and terrorism, natural disasters, including earthquakes, typhoons, floods and fires, or from health epidemics or pandemics or other contagious outbreaks; 
 our ability to respond to new lighting and control technologies and market trends; 
 our ability to fulfill our warranty obligations with safe and reliable products; 
 any delays we may encounter in making new products available or fulfilling customer specifications; 
 any flaws or defects in our products or in the manner in which they are used or installed; 
 our ability to protect our intellectual property rights and other confidential information, and manage infringement claims by others; 
 our compliance with government contracting laws and regulations, through both direct and indirect sale channels, as well as other laws, such as those relating to the environment and health and safety; 
 risks inherent in international markets, such as economic and political uncertainty, changing regulatory and tax requirements and currency fluctuations, including tariffs and other potential barriers to international trade; and 
 our ability to maintain effective internal controls and otherwise comply with our obligations as a public company. 
 In light of the foregoing, we caution you not to place undue reliance on our forward-looking statements. Any forward-looking statement that we make in this Quarterly Report speaks only as of the date of such statement, and we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement or to publicly announce the results of any revision to any of those statements to reflect future events or developments, except as required by law. Comparisons of results for current and any prior periods are not intended to express any future trends or indications of future performance, unless specifically expressed as such, and should only be viewed as historical data. Furthermore, new risks and uncertainties arise from time to time, and it is impossible for us to predict those events or how they may affect us.

 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023, and total cash used in operating activities of million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023, we determined that substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern continues to exist at September 30, 2024. As a result of restructuring actions and initiatives, we have tailored our operating expenses to be more in line with our expected sales volumes; however, we continue to incur losses and have a substantial accumulated deficit. 
 Additionally, global supply chain and logistics constraints are impacting our inventory purchasing strategy, as we seek to manage both shortages of available components and longer lead times in obtaining components while pursuing cost-saving measures to enhance profitability. As a result, we will continue to review and pursue selected external funding sources to ensure adequate financial resources to execute across the timelines required to achieve these objectives including, but not limited to, the following: 
 obtaining financing from traditional or non-traditional investment capital organizations or individuals; 
 obtaining funding from the sale of our common stock or other equity or debt instruments; and 
 obtaining debt financing with lending terms that more closely match our business model and capital needs. 
 There can be no assurance that we will obtain funding on acceptable terms, in a timely fashion, or at all. Obtaining additional funding contains risks, including: 
 additional equity financing may not be available to us on satisfactory terms, particularly in light of the current price of our common stock, and any equity we are able to issue could lead to dilution for current stockholders and have rights, preferences and privileges senior to our common stock; 
 loans or other debt instruments may have terms or conditions, such as interest rate, restrictive covenants, conversion features, refinancing demands, and control or revocation provisions, which are not acceptable to management or the Company s Board of Directors (the Board of Directors and 
 the current environment in the capital markets and volatile interest rates, combined with our capital constraints, may prevent us from being able to obtain adequate debt financing. 
 Considering both quantitative and qualitative information, we continue to believe that the combination of our plans to ensure adequate external funding, timely re-organizational actions, current financial position, liquid resources, obligations due or anticipated within the next year, development and implementation of an excess inventory reduction plan, plans and initiatives in our research and development, product development and sales and marketing, and development of potential channel partnerships, if adequately executed, could provide us with an ability to finance our operations through the next twelve months and may mitigate the substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. 
 Nasdaq Capital Market Compliance 
 As of the date of this Quarterly Report, the Company believes it has maintained compliance with the Minimum Stockholders Equity Rule, which requires listed companies to maintain stockholders equity of at least million for continued listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market. To become compliant with the Bid Price Rule, which has a minimum bid price of at least per share as one of its continued listing requirements, the Company effected a 1-for-7 reverse stock split to increase the per share trading price of the common stock, effective June 16, 2023 (See Note 8, Stockholders Equity ). 
 However, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to maintain compliance with the Minimum Stockholders Equity Rule, Bid Price Rule, or other Nasdaq listing requirements. If the Company fails to maintain compliance with Nasdaq s continued listing standards in accordance with the Panel s decision, the Company s common stock will be subject to delisting from Nasdaq

 As a result of the net loss we incurred for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, convertible securities representing approximately thousand shares of common stock were excluded from the basic loss per share calculation as their inclusion would have been anti-dilutive. 
 . One product was sold in 2020 with a warranty. Warranty settlement costs consist of actual amounts expensed for warranty, which are largely a result of the cost of replacement products or rework services provided to our customers. A liability for the estimated future costs under product warranties is maintained for products under warranty based on the actual claims incurred to date and the estimated nature, frequency, and costs of future claims. These estimates are inherently uncertain and changes to our historical or projected experience may cause material changes to our warranty reserves in the future. We continuously review the assumptions related to the adequacy of our warranty reserve, including product failure rates, and make adjustments to the existing warranty liability when there are changes to these estimates or the underlying replacement product costs, or the warranty period expires.

 We require substantial amounts of purchased materials from selected vendors. With specific materials, all of our purchases are from a single vendor. The availability and costs of materials may be subject to change due to, among other things, new laws or regulations, suppliers allocation to other purchasers, interruptions in production by suppliers, global health issues such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and changes in exchange rates and worldwide price and demand levels. Our inability to obtain adequate supplies of materials for our products at favorable prices could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, or results of operations by decreasing our profit margins and by hindering our ability to deliver products to our customers on a timely basis. Additionally, certain vendors require advance deposits prior to the fulfillment of orders. Deposits paid on unfulfilled orders totaled million and million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes thereto included in Part I, Item 1, Financial Statements of this Quarterly Report, as well as Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 2023 Annual Report ). 
 
 Overview 
 Energy Focus, Inc. engages primarily in the design, development, manufacturing, marketing and sale of energy-efficient lighting systems and controls. We develop, market and sell high quality light-emitting diode LED lighting and controls products in the commercial market and military maritime market MMM ). Our mission is to enable our customers to run their facilities with greater energy efficiency, productivity, and human health and wellness through advanced LED retrofit solutions. Our goal is to be a market leader for the most demanding applications where performance, quality, value, environmental impact and health are considered paramount. We specialize in energy efficient LED lighting retrofit product, replacing fluorescent, high-intensity discharge lighting and other types of lamps in institutional buildings for primarily indoor lighting applications with our innovative, high-quality commercial and military-grade tubular LED TLED products, as well as other LED and lighting control products for commercial and consumer applications. We are also evaluating adjacent technologies, including Gallium Nitride GaN based power supplies and additional market opportunities for energy solution products that support sustainability in our existing channels. 
 The LED lighting industry has changed dramatically over the past several years due to increasing competition and price erosion. We have been experiencing these industry forces in both our military and commercial business since 2016, when we once commanded significant price premiums for our flicker-free TLEDs with industry leading warranties. In more recent years, we have focused on redesigning our products for lower costs and consolidated our supply chain for stronger purchasing power in an effort to price our products more competitively while not impacting the performance and quality. Despite these efforts, our legacy products continue to face extreme price competition and a convergence of product functionality in the marketplace, and we have shifted to diversifying our supply chain in an effort to increase value and remain competitive. These trends are not unique to Energy Focus as evidenced by the increasing number of industry peers facing challenges, exiting LED lighting, selling assets and even going out of business. 
 In addition to continuously pursuing cost reductions, our strategy to combat these trends is to innovate both our technology and product offerings with differentiated products and solutions that offer greater, distinct value. Specific examples of these products we have developed include the RedCap , our patented emergency backup battery integrated TLED, as well as our robust MMM product offering. The Company has enhanced the performance of our RedCap product by providing a more user friendly experience. We continue to evaluate our sales strategy and believe our go-to-market strategy that focuses more on direct-sales marketing, selectively expanding our channel partner network to cover territories across the country, and listening to the voice of the customer will lead to better and more impactful product development efforts that we believe will eventually translate into larger addressable markets and greater sales growth for us. 
 Since 2023, the Company has continued to make significant cost cutting efforts to address operational expenses while maintaining customer satisfaction and delivering goods on-time. Investments into Energy Focus have contributed to the ability of the Company to continue to not only provide quality products and services, but to both expand and rationalize product offerings. 
 It is our belief that the continued dramatic rightsizing efforts undertaken in 2023 and 2024, along with reorganization of the sales team and ongoing development of innovative, high-value products and an expanded distribution network, will over time result in improved sales and bottom-line performance for the Company. 
 During 2023, our MMM business continued to face challenges resulting from the delayed availability of government funding and the timing of U.S. Navy awards, with several anticipated projects facing repeated and ongoing delays. This sector also maintains very long sales cycles. The timeline between bid to order can often take at least six months, and many MMM products are built-to-order with resultant lead times before orders become revenue. We continue to pursue opportunities from the U.S. Navy and the government sector to minimize such volatility. Previously in our MMM business, significant efforts undertaken to reduce costs in our product offerings have positioned us to be more competitive along with improved production efficiencies. Such efforts allowed us to continue to win bids and proposals that helped grow our MMM sales pipeline in the second half of 2023. While we continue to aggressively seek to increase sales of our commercial products, the MMM business offers us continued sales opportunities, in addition to validating our product quality and strengthening our brand trust in the marketplace. During 2023, we thoroughly reviewed and adjusted our commercial pricing 
 27 

position as well as our strategic relationships and partnerships within the commercial LED market space. We believe our new pricing position will give us a greater advantage than previously held against the competition and offer a more attractive entry point for our end customer base. 
 Meanwhile, we continue to seek additional external funding alternatives and sources to support our growth strategies, plans and initiatives. The strategic investments in 2023 and 2024 by Sander Electronics, Inc. Sander ), a shareholder of the Company, contributed meaningful external capital, as well as presented synergistic opportunities to improve and diversify our supply chain and product offerings. 
 Despite continuing progress on cost reduction throughout 2023 and 2024, the Company s results reflect the challenges due to long and unpredictable sales cycles, unexpected delays in MMM and commercial customer retrofit budgets and project starts, and supply chain issues. There has also been continuing aggressive price competition in the lighting industry. We continue to incur losses and we have a substantial accumulated deficit, which continues to raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern at September 30, 2024. 
 Our Business Strategy 
 Demand-oriented Approach 
 
 In order to deepen our relationships with customers, we are in the process of re-establishing our service model, aiming to provide richer and more targeted customer service. We believe that by increasing opportunities for interaction with our customers, we can better understand their needs, thereby enhancing their loyalty to our brand. 
 
 To ensure that EFOI s products, pricing, and customer service lifecycle are better aligned, we are building a comprehensive value model to ensure consistency in the products and services we provide throughout the customer journey. We have begun an in-depth analysis of our current and past top 10 customers over the last five years to identify the core factors that make them loyal customers. By analyzing this data, we hope to reveal the key elements that enhance customer stickiness, providing them with more reasons and value to stay with us. In particular, we are actively focusing on customers with high loyalty to better meet their needs. This is not only an acknowledgment of our products but also a validation of the quality of our service. 
 
 Supply-oriented Approach 
 
 EFOI is committed to adopting three main sustainable economy strategies: Green Supply Chain , Green Product , and Green Manufacturing , aiming to promote sustainability throughout the entire value chain. The Company is working closely with its supply chain partners to optimize recycling mechanisms and strengthen packaging design, integrating sustainable economy principles into the core of supply chain management. 
 
 Guided by the vision of transcending traditional corporate social responsibility and creating shared value , EFOI s team is focusing on stakeholders, aiming to achieve a dual profit engine effect by combining financial performance and Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) practices. This strategy not only aligns with the Company s responsibility and sustainability goals but is also expected to enhance overall performance and market competitiveness. EFOI's operational team's new strategy focuses on integrating environmental and economic benefits, aiming to create a win-win situation that benefits the company, society, and the environment. 
 
 Under the premise of a similar industrial environment and familiar relationships, our professional skills complement those of our supply chain partners. This foundation of cooperation enables us to more easily achieve common goals of cost reduction, profit sharing, and exploring new business opportunities. This not only strengthens our cooperative relationship but also lays a solid foundation for our joint efforts towards a better future.. 
 
 Financial-oriented Approach 
 
 The Company applies strategic financial management in the below perspective. 
 
 Control and Monitoring of Assets and Liabilities 
 Assets: Regularly evaluate all assets, especially inventory, to ensure they remain in optimal condition in terms of value and performance. Minimize or mitigate the impact of inefficient and aging assets, focusing on assets with high efficiency and return. 
 28 

Liabilities: Ensure a robust liability structure, optimize the cost of liabilities, and seek lower interest rates and more favorable repayment terms. Regularly review the liability situation to ensure the company s level of liabilities remains within a safe range. 
 
 Structured Profitability 
 Revenue Growth: Develop diversified revenue streams, reduce dependency on single business or market, continuously optimize products and services, and enhance market competitiveness. 
 Cost Control: Strictly control operating costs, seek opportunities to reduce costs, and ensure the efficient use of resources to optimize operations. 
 Cash Flow Management: Establish a sound accounts receivable and payable management system to ensure timely collection of receivables and reasonable arrangement of payments. Maintain sufficient cash reserves to cope with potential funding shortages.

 Net sales of 1.2 million for the third quarter of 2024 decreased 0.1 million, or 11 , compared to third quarter of 2023 net sales of 1.3 million, primarily driven by a decrease in commercial sales of 0.1 million, or 30 , that was partially offset by a 1 increase in MMM sales.

 Net sales of 3.6 million for the first nine months of 2024 increased 0.3 million, or 8 , compared to the same period in 2023, primarily driven by a 20 decrease in commercial product sales, that was partially offset by an increase in MMM product sales of 25 for the first nine months of 2024, as compared to the same period of 2023.

The 5 thousand decrease primarily resulted from lower payroll-related expenses due to reduction in the headcount offset by an increase in traveling expenses and product testing fees. Product development expenses relate to customization of product offerings for key customers. 
 Product development expenses were 405 thousand for the first nine months of 2024, a 38 thousand decrease compared to 443 thousand for the first nine months of 2023. The decrease is primarily related to payroll expense and decreased headcount, offset by an increase in traveling expense and product testing fee. 
 Selling, general and administrative 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses were 0.4 million for the third quarter of 2024, down 37 as compared to 0.7 million in the third quarter of 2023.

 30 

Selling, general and administrative expenses were 1.6 million for the first nine months of 2024, compared to 2.9 million for the first nine months of 2023.

 Other Expense (Income) 
 Interest expense 
 There was no interest expense for the third quarter of 2024, compared to interest expense of 34 thousand for the third quarter of 2023. The decrease in interest expense is primarily related to early termination of the 2022 Streeterville Note.

 Due to the operating losses incurred during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, and after application of the annual limitation set forth under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, it was not necessary to record a provision for U.S. federal income tax or various state income taxes as income tax benefits are fully offset by a valuation allowance recorded. 
 
 Net loss 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, our net loss of 0.3 million decreased 67 from 0.9 million net loss for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease is primarily due to a decrease in operating expenses and increase in gross profit in the third quarter of 2024 from the third quarter of 2023. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our net loss of 1.3 million decreased 63 from 3.4 million net loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

Financial condition 
 At September 30, 2024, we had 0.8 million in cash and no outstanding debt. We have historically incurred substantial losses, and as of September 30, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of 154.6 million. Additionally, our sales have been concentrated among a few major customers and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, three customers accounted for approximately 39 of net sales. 
 We remain committed to building upon the transformation activities started during 2019 that sought to stabilize and regrow our business. These efforts include the following key developments: 
 We reinvested in our MMM sales channel and are pursuing existing and new sales opportunities, though the sales cycles for what are frequently made-to-order products are longer than commercial offerings. 
 The Company has aggressively re-evaluated operating expenses, and reduced its workforce significantly throughout 2023 and into 2024 to manage fixed costs. 
 We continued to seek additional external funding alternatives and sources to support our growth strategies, plans and initiatives. 
 
 We continue to closely monitored our cost control efforts to streamline our operations by closely managing all spending done throughout the Company, while carefully investing in new products and strategies that sought to reenergize sales. 
 We will seek to remain agile as an organization to respond to potential or continuing weakness in the macroeconomic environment and in the meantime seek to expand sales channels and enter new markets that we believe will provide additional growth opportunities. We plan to achieve profitability through developing and launching new, innovative products, our Redcap emergency battery backup tubular TLEDs, evaluating new growth opportunities such as GaN-based power supply circuitry and other energy solution products, as well as executing on our multi-channel sales strategy that targets key verticals, such as government, healthcare, education and commercial and industrial, complemented by our marketing outreach campaigns and expanding channel partnerships. In addition, we intend to continue to apply rigorous financial discipline in our organizational structure, decision-making, business processes and policies, strategic sourcing activities and supply chain practices to help accelerate our path towards profitability.
