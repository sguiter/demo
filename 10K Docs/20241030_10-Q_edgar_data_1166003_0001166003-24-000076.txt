 insurance companies in a case captioned Allianz Global Risks US Ins. Co. v. ACE Property Casualty Ins. Co., et al., Multnomah County Circuit Court (Case No. 1204-04552). Allianz Global Risks US Ins. Co. Allianz sought contribution on environmental and product liability claims that Allianz agreed to defend and indemnify on behalf of its insured, Daimler Trucks North America DTNA ). Defendants had insured Freightliner s assets, which DTNA acquired in 1981. Con-way, Freightliner s former parent company, intervened. We acquired Con-way in 2015. Con-way and Freightliner had self-insured under fronting agreements with defendant insurers ACE, Westport, and General. Under those agreements, Con-way agreed to indemnify the fronting carriers for damages assessed under the fronting policies. Con-way s captive insurer, Centron, was also a named defendant. After a seven-week jury trial in 2014, the jury found that Con-way and the fronting insurers never intended that the insurers defend or indemnify any claims against Freightliner. In June 2015, Allianz appealed to the Oregon Court of Appeals. In May 2019, the Oregon Court of Appeals upheld the jury verdict. In September 2019, Allianz appealed to the Oregon Supreme Court. In March 2021, the Oregon Supreme Court reversed the jury verdict, holding that it was an error to allow the jury to decide how the parties intended the fronting policies to operate, and also holding that the trial court improperly instructed the jury concerning one of the pollution exclusions at issue. In July 2021, the matter was remanded to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with the Oregon Supreme Court s decision. In June 2023, the trial court decided the parties cross-motions for summary judgment, leaving open the pollution exclusion and allocation issues. The trial on the pollution exclusion issue took place in October 2024 where the jury issued a favorable verdict for the Company, finding that the pollution exclusion applied to the General policy over several years for which Allianz seeks contribution. The trial on allocation of defense and indemnity costs among the applicable insurance policies is to take place in early 2025. We have accrued an immaterial amount for the potential exposure associated with ultimate allocation to the relevant policies; however, any losses that may arise in connection with the fronting policies issued by defendant insurers ACE, Westport, and General are not reasonably estimable at this time.

 Importantly, our LTL business historically has generated a high return on invested capital and robust free cash flow. This supports our ongoing investments in our people, network capacity and proprietary technology. We manage the business to specific objectives, such as high customer service scores for on-time delivery and damage-free freight, the optimal sourcing of linehaul transportation, and the expansion of our service center footprint in strategic markets with long-term demand. Since implementing our LTL 2.0 growth plan in the fourth quarter of 2021, we have added over 4,400 tractors and 14,700 trailers. 
 In 2023, we produced over 6,400 trailers at our in-house trailer manufacturing facility, surpassing our goal of more than 6,000 trailers, and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we produced over 3,600 trailers. Our in-house trailer manufacturing is an example of a self-reliant capability that is competitively advantageous to us, particularly when industry conditions make it difficult to source equipment. 
 In December 2023, we completed the acquisition of 28 service centers previously operated by Yellow Corporation (the Yellow Asset Acquisition ), representing approximately 2,900 doors. We expect the net increase in doors to be approximately two-thirds of the gross number purchased as we look for opportunities to rationalize our existing footprint. This strategic acquisition of assets aligns with our commitment to invest in expanding our LTL network capacity. 
 As a leading provider of freight transportation services, our business can be impacted to varying degrees by factors beyond our control. In 2024, the overall freight environment continues to be recessionary, in large part due to underlying demand trends. Despite this, we continue to perform well and see growth potential ahead as we continue to expand our business by investing in capacity for the long-term, gaining profitable market share and aligning price with the value we provide to customers. 
 Specific to our technology, we believe that we have a large opportunity to drive further growth and profitability in our LTL network through innovation. For more information, see Technology below.

 XPO has a unique pan-European transportation platform with leading positions in key geographies: We are the #1 full truckload broker and the #1 pallet network (LTL) provider in France; the #1 full truckload broker and the #1 LTL provider in Iberia (Spain and Portugal); and a top-tier dedicated truckload provider in the U.K., where we also have the largest single-owner LTL network. We serve an extensive base of customers within the consumer, trade and industrial markets, including many sector leaders that have long-tenured relationships with us. 
 Our range of freight services in Europe encompasses dedicated truckload, LTL, truck brokerage, managed transportation, last mile, freight forwarding, warehousing and, increasingly, multimodal solutions, such as road-rail and road-short sea combinations that we tailor to customer needs. Our operators use our proprietary technology to manage these services within our digital ecosystem in Europe. 
 Technology 
 One of the ways in which we deliver superior service to our customers is by empowering our employees with technology. Our industry is evolving, and customers want to de-risk their supply chains by forming relationships with reliable service providers that have invested in innovation. 
 We have built a highly scalable ecosystem on the cloud that deploys our software consistently across our operating footprint. In our North American LTL business, the caliber of our technology is mission-critical to our success; it optimizes linehaul, pickup-and-delivery and pricing the main components of the service we provide. An LTL network of our scale has hundreds of thousands of activities underway at any given time, all managed on our technology. For the trailing 12 months ended September 30, 2024, we moved approximately 18 billion pounds of freight 820 million miles, including moving linehaul freight an average of 2.6 million miles a day.

 Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared with Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 Our consolidated revenue for the third quarter of 2024 increased 3.7 to 2.1 billion, compared with the same quarter in 2023. Our consolidated revenue for the first nine months of 2024 increased 6.0 to 6.2 billion, compared with the same period in 2023. The increase in both periods reflects growth in both of our reportable segments, partially offset by a decline in fuel surcharge revenue in our North American LTL segment. Foreign currency movement did not impact revenue in the third quarter of 2024 and increased revenue by approximately 0.3 percentage points in the first nine months of 2024. 
 Salaries, wages and employee benefits includes compensation-related costs for our employees, including salaries, wages, incentive compensation, healthcare-related costs and payroll taxes, and covers drivers and dockworkers, operations and facility workers and employees in support roles and other positions. Salaries, wages and employee benefits for the third quarter of 2024 was 852 million, or 41.5 of revenue, compared with 809 million, or 40.9 of revenue, for the same quarter in 2023. Salaries, wages and employee benefits for the first nine months of 2024 was 2.5 billion, or 41.3 of revenue, compared with 2.4 billion, or 40.6 of revenue, for the same period in

Table of Contents 

 2023. The year-over-year increase as a percentage of revenue in both periods primarily reflects the impact of inflation on our cost base and the insourcing of a greater proportion of linehaul from third-party transportation providers. 
 Purchased transportation includes costs of procuring third-party freight transportation. Purchased transportation for the third quarter of 2024 was 430 million, or 20.9 of revenue, compared with 437 million, or 22.1 of revenue, for the same quarter in 2023. Purchased transportation for the first nine months of 2024 was 1.30 billion, or 21.2 of revenue, compared with 1.34 billion, or 23.1 of revenue, for the same period in 2023. The year-over-year decrease as a percentage of revenue in both periods primarily reflects the insourcing of a greater proportion of linehaul from third-party transportation providers and, to a lesser extent, lower rates paid to third-party providers for purchased transportation miles in our North American LTL segment, partially offset by higher purchased transportation in our European Transportation segment. 
 Fuel, operating expenses and supplies includes the cost of fuel purchased for use in our vehicles as well as related taxes, maintenance and lease costs for our equipment, including tractors and trailers, costs related to operating our owned and leased facilities, bad debt expense, third-party professional fees, information technology expenses and supplies expense. Fuel, operating expenses and supplies for the third quarter of 2024 was 399 million, or 19.4 of revenue, compared with 406 million, or 20.5 of revenue, for the same quarter in 2023. Fuel, operating expenses and supplies for the first nine months of 2024 was 1.21 billion, or 19.7 of revenue, compared with 1.22 billion, or 21.1 of revenue, for the same period in 2023. The year-over-year decrease as a percentage of revenue in both periods primarily reflects lower fuel costs. 
 Operating taxes and licenses includes tax expenses related to our vehicles and our owned and leased facilities as well as license expenses to operate our vehicles. Operating taxes and licenses for the third quarter of 2024 was 21 million, compared with 15 million for the same quarter in 2023. Operating taxes and licenses for the first nine months of 2024 was 61 million, compared with 45 million for the same period in 2023. The year-over-year increase in both periods primarily reflects property taxes on service centers acquired in the Yellow Asset Acquisition. 
 Insurance and claims includes costs related to vehicular and cargo claims for both purchased insurance and self-insurance programs. Insurance and claims for the third quarter of 2024 was 33 million, compared with 39 million for the same quarter in 2023. Insurance and claims for the first nine months of 2024 was 105 million, compared with 129 million for the same period in 2023. The year-over-year decrease in both periods reflects lower expense due to improved damage frequency, partially offset by higher vehicular insurance costs. 
 (Gains) losses on sales of property and equipment for the third quarter of 2024 was 0 million, compared with a loss of 1 million for the same quarter in 2023. (Gains) losses on sales of property and equipment in the first nine months of 2024 was a gain of 5 million, compared with a gain of 4 million for the same period in 2023. 
 Depreciation and amortization expense for the third quarter of 2024 was 126 million, compared with 110 million for the same quarter in 2023. Depreciation and amortization expense for the first nine months of 2024 was 365 million, compared with 318 million for the same period in 2023. The year-over-year increase in both periods reflects the impact of capital investments, in particular tractors and trailers, as well as service centers acquired in the Yellow Asset Acquisition. 
 Transaction and integration costs for the third quarter of 2024 were 13 million, compared with 8 million for the same quarter in 2023. Transaction and integration costs for the first nine months of 2024 were 39 million, compared with 47 million for the same period in 2023. Transaction and integration costs for both periods of 2024 and 2023 are primarily comprised of stock-based compensation for certain employees related to strategic initiatives. We expect stock-based compensation costs related to our previously announced strategic initiatives to conclude in 2024. 
 Restructuring costs for the third quarter of 2024 were 3 million, compared with 1 million for the same quarter in 2023. Restructuring costs for the first nine months of 2024 were 17 million, compared with 35 million for the same period in 2023. We engage in restructuring actions as part of our ongoing efforts to best use our resources and infrastructure. For more information, see Note 4 Restructuring Charges to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.

 Other income for the third quarter of 2024 was 15 million, compared with 4 million for the same quarter in 2023. Other income for the first nine months of 2024 was 31 million, compared with 12 million for the same period in 2023. The year-over-year increase reflects 9 million of investment income in the third quarter of 2024 and 13 million of investment income in the first nine months of 2024 in Corporate on a past investment in a private company that was sold in the quarter, compared with no investment income in the 2023 periods, as well as an increase in net periodic pension income in both 2024 periods. 
 Debt extinguishment loss was 23 million for the first nine months of 2023, which related to the refinancing of our Existing Term Loan Facility (as defined below) in the second quarter of 2023. There was no debt extinguishment loss in the third quarter of 2023 or in 2024. 
 Interest expense increased to 56 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared with 41 million for the same quarter in 2023. Interest expense increased to 170 million for the first nine months of 2024, compared with 126 million for the same period in 2023. The increase in both periods is primarily due to the debt issuance in the fourth quarter of 2023 to finance the Yellow Asset Acquisition. 
 Our effective income tax rates were 29.7 and 27.0 for the third quarter of 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 16.0 and 26.4 for the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, respectively. The effective income tax rates for the third quarter and nine-month periods of 2024 and 2023 were based on forecasted full-year effective income tax rates, adjusted for discrete items that occurred within the periods presented. The increase in our effective income tax rate for the third quarter of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 was primarily driven by losses for which no tax benefit can be recognized and a reduction in the one-time tax benefit initially recognized in the second quarter of 2024 related to the legal entity reorganization in our European Transportation business, partially offset by a decrease in forecasted non-deductible executive compensation expense. The decrease in our effective income tax rate for the first nine months of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 was primarily driven by a one-time tax benefit of 40 million associated with the legal entity reorganization in our European Transportation business and a reduced impact from forecasted non-deductible executive compensation expense as a result of higher pre-tax income in 2024 compared to the same period in 2023, partially offset by the impact of losses for which no tax benefit can be recognized. 
 We expect the legal entity reorganization to generate a net cash refund of approximately 45 million, to be received primarily in 2025. 
 Segment Financial Results 
 Our chief operating decision maker CODM regularly reviews financial information at the operating segment level to allocate resources to the segments and to assess their performance. Our CODM evaluates segment profit (loss) based on adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization Adjusted EBITDA ), which we define as income from continuing operations before debt extinguishment loss, interest expense, income tax provision, depreciation and amortization expense, transaction and integration costs, restructuring costs and other adjustments. Segment Adjusted EBITDA includes an allocation of corporate costs. See Note 2 Segment Reporting to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information and a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to Income from continuing operations.

 Revenue in our North American LTL segment increased 1.9 to 1.3 billion for the third quarter of 2024, compared with 1.2 billion for the same quarter in 2023. Revenue increased 7.4 to 3.7 billion for the first nine months of 2024, compared with 3.5 billion for the same period in 2023. Revenue included fuel surcharge revenue of 195 million and 223 million, respectively, for the third quarters of 2024 and 2023, and 613 million and 636 million, respectively, for the first nine months of 2024 and 2023. The decrease in fuel surcharge revenue was primarily driven by lower diesel prices. 
 We evaluate the revenue performance of our LTL business using several commonly used metrics, including volume (weight per day in pounds) and yield, which is a commonly used measure of LTL pricing trends. We measure yield using gross revenue per hundredweight, excluding fuel surcharges. Impacts on yield can include weight per shipment and length of haul, among other factors, while impacts on volume can include shipments per day and weight per shipment. The following table summarizes our key revenue metrics: 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change 2024 2023 Change Pounds per day (thousands) 69,470 72,257 (3.9) 70,950 70,465 0.7 Shipments per day 51,921 53,637 (3.2) 52,281 51,303 1.9 Average weight per shipment (in pounds) 1,338 1,347 (0.7) 1,357 1,374 (1.2) Gross revenue per hundredweight, excluding 
 fuel surcharges 
 24.34 22.81 6.7 23.67 21.84 8.4 
 Percentages presented are calculated using the underlying unrounded amounts. 
 The year-over-year increase in revenue, excluding fuel surcharge revenue, for both the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 reflects higher yield, primarily related to our improvements in service quality and the benefit of numerous pricing initiatives, partially offset by lower volume in the third quarter of 2024. The decrease in volume per day for the third quarter of 2024 reflects lower shipments per day and average weight per shipment. Volume per day increased for the first nine months of 2024, reflecting higher shipments per day partially offset by lower average weight per shipment. 
 Adjusted EBITDA was 284 million, or 22.7 of revenue, for the third quarter of 2024, compared with 241 million, or 19.6 of revenue, for the same quarter in 2023. Adjusted EBITDA was 836 million, or 22.3 of revenue, for the first nine months of 2024, compared with 631 million, or 18.1 of revenue, for the same period in 2023. The increase in Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenue in both the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 reflects lower purchased transportation, damage claims, and fuel costs, partially offset by higher salaries, wages and employee benefits and vehicular insurance costs. 
 Depreciation and amortization expense increased to 89 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared with 75 million for the same quarter in 2023. Depreciation and amortization expense increased to 257 million in the first nine months of 2024 compared with 214 million for the same period in 2023. The increase in both the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 was due to the impact of capital investments, in particular tractors and trailers, as well as service centers acquired in the Yellow Asset Acquisition.

 Revenue in our European Transportation segment increased 6.8 to 803 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared with 752 million for the same quarter in 2023. Revenue increased 3.8 to 2.4 billion for the first nine months of 2024, compared with 2.3 billion for the same period in 2023. Foreign currency movement increased revenue by approximately 0.1 percentage points in the third quarter of 2024 and by approximately 0.9 percentage points in the first nine months of 2024. The increase in revenue during both periods in 2024, compared to the same periods in 2023, after taking into effect the impact of foreign currency movement, primarily reflects higher volume and yield. 
 Adjusted EBITDA was 44 million, or 5.4 of revenue, for the third quarter of 2024, compared with 44 million, or 5.8 of revenue, for the same quarter in 2023. Adjusted EBITDA was 131 million, or 5.4 of revenue, for the first nine months of 2024, compared with 127 million, or 5.5 of revenue, for the same period in 2023. The change in Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenue in both the third quarter and the first nine months of 2024 primarily reflects higher salaries, wages and employee benefits and purchased transportation, partially offset by lower fuel costs as a percentage of revenue. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Our cash and cash equivalents balance was 378 million as of September 30, 2024, compared to 412 million as of December 31, 2023. Our principal existing sources of cash are: (i) cash generated from operations; (ii) borrowings available under our Second Amended and Restated Revolving Loan Credit Agreement, as amended (the ABL Facility and (iii) proceeds from the issuance of other debt. As of September 30, 2024, we have 556 million available to draw under our ABL Facility, based on a borrowing base of 557 million and outstanding letters of credit of less than 1 million. Additionally, we have a 200 million uncommitted secured evergreen letter of credit facility, under which we had issued 137 million in aggregate face amount of letters of credit as of September 30, 2024. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had approximately 934 million of total liquidity. We continually evaluate our liquidity requirements in light of our operating needs, growth initiatives and capital resources. We believe that our existing liquidity and sources of capital are sufficient to support our operations over the next 12 months. 
 Trade Receivables Securitization and Factoring Programs 
 We sell certain of our trade accounts receivable on a non-recourse basis to third-party financial institutions under factoring agreements. We also sell trade accounts receivable under a securitization program for our European Transportation business. We use trade receivables securitization and factoring programs to help manage our cash flows and offset the impact of extended payment terms for some of our customers. For more information, see Note 1 Organization, Description of Business and Basis of Presentation to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 The maximum amount of net cash proceeds available at any one time under our securitization program, inclusive of any unsecured borrowings, is 200 million (approximately 223 million as of September 30, 2024). As of September 30, 2024, the maximum amount available under the program was utilized. Under the securitization program, we service the receivables we sell on behalf of the purchasers. The program expires in July 2026.

 Term Loan Facility 
 In 2015, we entered into a Term Loan Credit Agreement that provided for a single borrowing of 1.6 billion, which was subsequently amended to increase the principal balance to 2.0 billion and to extend the maturity date to February 2025 (the Existing Term Loan Facility ). 
 In the second quarter of 2023, we amended the Term Loan Credit Agreement to obtain 700 million of new term loans (the New Term Loan Facility having substantially similar terms as the Existing Term Loan Facility, except with respect to maturity date, issue price, interest rate, prepayment premiums in connection with certain voluntary prepayments and certain other provisions. The New Term Loan Facility was issued at 99.5 of the face amount and will mature in May 2028. 
 In the same period, we used net proceeds from the New Term Loan Facility, the Senior Secured Notes due 2028 (as defined below) and the Senior Notes due 2031 (as defined below), together with cash on hand, to repay 2.0 billion of outstanding principal under the Existing Term Loan Facility and to pay related fees, expenses and accrued interest. We recorded a debt extinguishment loss of 23 million in the second quarter 2023 due to this repayment. 
 In the fourth quarter of 2023, we entered into an incremental amendment to the Term Loan Credit Agreement to obtain 400 million of incremental term loans (the Incremental Term Loans ). The Incremental Term Loans are a new tranche of loans under the Term Loan Credit Agreement and will mature in February 2031. 
 The weighted average interest rate of our term loans was approximately 7.20 as of September 30, 2024. 
 Senior Notes Due 2028 and 2031 
 In the second quarter of 2023, we completed private placements of 830 million aggregate principal amount of senior secured notes due 2028 (the Senior Secured Notes due 2028 and 450 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due 2031 (the Senior Notes due 2031 ). The Senior Secured Notes due 2028 mature in June 2028 and bear interest at a rate of 6.25 per annum. The Senior Notes due 2031 mature in June 2031 and bear interest at a rate of 7.125 per annum. Interest is payable semi-annually in cash in arrears and commenced December 1, 2023. These notes were issued at par and were used to repay our Existing Term Loan Facility as described above. 
 Loan Covenants and Compliance 
 As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with the covenants and other provisions of our debt agreements. Any failure to comply with any material provision or covenant of these agreements could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and operations. 
 Sources and Uses of Cash 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, (In millions) 2024 2023 Net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations 619 443 Net cash used in investing activities from continuing operations (598) (473) Net cash used in financing activities from continuing operations (59) (72) 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we generated cash from operating activities from continuing operations of 619 million. We used cash during the period primarily to: (i) purchase property and equipment of 623 million; (ii) make payments on debt and finance leases of 64 million; and (iii) make payments of 21 million related to tax withholding obligations in connection with the vesting of restricted shares. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we: (i) generated cash from operating activities from continuing operations of 443 million; and (ii) received net proceeds of 2.0 billion from the issuance of debt. We used cash during this period primarily to: (i) purchase property and equipment of 494 million; and (ii) repurchase our Existing Term Loan Facility for 2.0 billion.

Table of Contents 

 Cash flows from operating activities from continuing operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 176 million, compared with the same period in 2023. The increase primarily reflects: (i) higher income from continuing operations of 178 million and (ii) higher non-cash depreciation and amortization of 47 million, that is added back in the determination of operating cash flows. These items were partially offset by the impact of operating assets and liabilities utilizing 166 million of cash in the first nine months of 2024, compared with utilizing 133 million during the same period in 2023. 
 Investing activities from continuing operations used 598 million of cash in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 473 million of cash in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we used 623 million to purchase property and equipment, as compared to a 494 million usage of cash in the same period in 2023. The increase reflects our continued investment to support our long-term growth targets. 
 Financing activities from continuing operations used 59 million of cash in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 72 million of cash in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The primary use of cash from financing activities during the first nine months of 2024 was 64 million used to repay borrowings, primarily related to finance lease obligations, and 21 million to make payments for tax withholdings on restricted shares. The primary uses of cash from financing activities during the first nine months of 2023 was 2.0 billion used to repay our Existing Term Loan Facility. The primary source of cash from financing activities during the first nine months of 2024 was 32 million of proceeds from bank overdrafts. The primary source of cash from financing activities during the first nine months of 2023 was 2.0 billion of net proceeds from the issuance of debt. 
 There were no material changes to our December 31, 2023 contractual obligations during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. We anticipate full year gross capital expenditures to be between 700 million and 800 million in 2024, funded by cash on hand, cash generated from operations and available liquidity. This includes capital expenditures to integrate the service centers acquired in the Yellow Asset Acquisition into our network.
