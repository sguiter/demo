for AFS securities which were sold subsequent to September 30, 2024. For those AFS debt securities in an unrealized loss position that do not meet either of these criteria, management assesses whether the decline in fair value has resulted from credit-related factors, using both qualitative and quantitative criteria. Determining the allowance under the credit loss method requires the use of a discounted cash flow method to assess the credit losses. Any credit-related impairment will be recognized in allowance for credit losses on the balance sheet with a corresponding adjustment to earnings. Noncredit-related temporary impairment, the portion of the impairment relating to factors other than credit (such as changes in market interest rates), is recognized in other comprehensive income, net of tax. 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we did t have an allowance for credit losses on our AFS securities, based on our consideration of the qualitative factors associated with each security type in our AFS portfolio. The unrealized losses on our investment and MBS are due to changes in interest rates and spreads and other market conditions. We had AFS debt securities in an unrealized loss position at September 30, 2024. Our state and political subdivisions are highly rated municipal securities with a long history of no credit losses. Our AFS MBS are highly rated securities which are either explicitly or implicitly backed by the U.S. Government through its agencies which are highly rated by major ratings agencies and also have a long history of no credit losses. Our corporate bonds and other investment securities consist of primarily investment grade bonds and private placement bonds. 
 We assess the likelihood of default and the potential amount of default when assessing our HTM securities for credit losses. We utilize term structures and, due to no prior loss exposure on our state and political subdivision securities or our corporate securities, we currently apply a third-party average loss given default rate to model these securities. We elected to use the specific identification method to model our HTM securities which aligns with our third-party fair value measurement process. As of September 30, 2024, bonds were rated below investment grade. The model determined any expected credit loss over the life of these securities to be insignificant. Management further evaluated the remote expectation of loss on the remainder of the HTM portfolio, along with the qualitative factors associated with these securities and concluded that, due to the securities being highly rated municipals and primarily investment grade corporates, private placement bonds with a long history of no credit losses, credit loss should be recognized for these securities for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 or 2023. 
 The accrued interest receivable on our debt securities is excluded from the credit loss estimate and is included in interest receivable on our consolidated balance sheets. As of September 30, 2024, accrued interest receivable on AFS and HTM debt securities totaled million and million, respectively. As of December 31, 2023, accrued interest receivable on AFS and HTM debt securities totaled million and million, respectively. HTM debt securities were past-due or on nonaccrual status as of September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023.

consisting of a loss of on the sale of approximately million of AFS municipal securities and a loss of on the unwind of the related fair value hedges, sold on October 1, 2024. There was a million net realized loss as a result of sales from the AFS securities portfolio for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, which consisted of million in realized losses and million in realized gains. There were sales from the HTM portfolio during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 or 2023. We calculate realized gains and losses on sales of securities under the specific identification method. 
 Expected maturities on our securities may differ from contractual maturities because issuers may have the right to call or prepay obligations. MBS are presented in total by category since MBS are typically issued with stated principal amounts and are backed by pools of mortgages that have loans with varying maturities. The characteristics of the underlying pool of mortgages, such as fixed-rate or adjustable-rate, as well as prepayment risk, are passed on to the security holder. The term of a mortgage-backed pass-through security thus approximates the term of the underlying mortgages and can vary significantly due to prepayments.

 Equity Investments 
 Equity investments on our consolidated balance sheets include Community Reinvestment Act funds with a readily determinable fair value as well as equity investments without readily determinable fair values. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had equity investments recorded in our consolidated balance sheets of million. 
 Any realized and unrealized gains and losses on equity investments are reported in income. Equity investments without readily determinable fair values are recorded at cost less impairment, if any. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, there was no gain or loss on the sale of equity securities.

 Equity investments are assessed quarterly for other-than-temporary impairment. Based upon that evaluation, management does t consider any of our equity investments to be other-than-temporarily impaired at September 30, 2024.

 Construction Real Estate Loans 
 Our construction loans are collateralized by property located primarily in or near the market areas we serve. A number of our construction loans will be owner occupied upon completion. Construction loans for non-owner occupied projects are financed, but these typically have cash flows from leases with tenants, secondary sources of repayment, and in some cases, additional collateral. Our construction loans have both adjustable and fixed interest rates during the construction period. Construction loans to individuals are typically priced and made with the intention of granting the permanent loan on the completed property. Commercial construction loans are subject to underwriting standards similar to that of the commercial real estate loan portfolio. Owner occupied 1-4 family residential construction loans are subject to the underwriting standards of the permanent loan. 
 1-4 Family Residential Real Estate Loans 
 Residential loan originations are generated by our mortgage loan officers, in-house origination staff, marketing efforts, present customers, walk-in customers and referrals from real estate agents and builders. We focus our lending efforts primarily on the origination of loans secured by first mortgages on owner occupied 1-4 family residences. Substantially all of our 1-4 family residential originations are secured by properties located in or near our market areas. 
 Our 1-4 family residential loans generally have maturities ranging from to years. These loans are typically fully amortizing with monthly payments sufficient to repay the total amount of the loan. Our 1-4 family residential loans are made at both fixed and adjustable interest rates. 
 Underwriting for 1-4 family residential loans includes debt-to-income analysis, credit history analysis, appraised value and down payment considerations. Changes in the market value of real estate can affect the potential losses in the residential portfolio. 
 Commercial Real Estate Loans 
 Commercial real estate loans as of September 30, 2024 consisted of billion of owner and non-owner occupied real estate, million of loans secured by multi-family properties and million of loans secured by farmland. Commercial real estate loans primarily include loans collateralized by retail, commercial office buildings, multi-family residential buildings, medical facilities and offices, senior living, assisted living and skilled nursing facilities, warehouse facilities, hotels and churches. In determining whether to originate commercial real estate loans, we generally consider such factors as the financial condition of the borrower and the debt service coverage of the property. Commercial real estate loans are made at both fixed and adjustable interest rates for terms generally up to years. 
 Commercial Loans 
 Our commercial loans are diversified loan types including short-term working capital loans for inventory and accounts receivable and short- and medium-term loans for equipment or other business capital expansion. In our commercial loan underwriting, we assess the creditworthiness, ability to repay and the value and liquidity of the collateral being offered. Terms of commercial loans are generally commensurate with the useful life of the collateral offered.

 We reversed and of interest income on nonaccrual loans during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. We had million and million of loans on nonaccrual for which there was no related allowance for credit losses as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 Collateral-dependent loans are loans that we expect the repayment to be provided substantially through the operation or sale of the collateral of the loan and for which we have determined that the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty. In such cases, expected credit losses are based on the fair value of the collateral at the measurement date, adjusted for selling costs. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had million and million, respectively, of collateral-dependent loans, secured mainly by real estate and equipment. There have been no significant changes to the collateral that secures the collateral-dependent assets. Foreclosed assets include OREO and repossessed assets. For 1-4 family residential real estate properties, a loan is recognized as a foreclosed property once legal title to the real estate property has been received upon completion of foreclosure or the borrower has conveyed all interest in the residential property through a deed in lieu of foreclosure. There were loans secured by 1-4 family residential properties for which formal foreclosure proceedings were in process as of September 30, 2024. There were million loans secured by 1-4 family residential properties for which formal foreclosure proceedings were in process as of December 31, 2023. 
 Restructured Loans 
 A loan is considered restructured if the borrower is experiencing financial difficulties and the loan has been modified. Modifications may include interest rate reductions or below market interest rates, restructuring amortization schedules and other actions intended to minimize potential losses. We may provide a combination of modifications which may include an extension of the amortization period, interest rate reduction and/or converting the loan to interest-only for a limited period of time. In most instances, interest will continue to be charged on principal balances outstanding during the extended term. Therefore, the financial effects of the recorded investment of loans restructured during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were not significant.

During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, there were restructured loans totaling of which had an extension of the amortization period and had a combination of an extension of the amortization period and an interest rate reduction. 
 On an ongoing basis, performance of restructured loans are monitored for subsequent payment default. Payment default is recognized when the borrower is 90 days or more past due. As of September 30, 2024, there was one restructured loan totaling in default. There were loans in default as of September 30, 2023. Payment defaults for restructured loans did not significantly impact the determination of the allowance for loan losses in the periods presented. At September 30, 2024, there were no commitments to lend additional funds to borrowers whose loans had been restructured.

There were million in borrowings from the FRDW at September 30, 2024, and million at December 31, 2023. To provide more stability and to assure banks have the ability to meet the needs of all of their depositors, the Federal Reserve created the BTFP in the first quarter of 2023. On March 11, 2024, the Federal Reserve stopped extending new BTFP advances. There were remaining borrowings from the BTFP at September 30, 2024 compared to million at December 31, 2023.

 million of Bank liabilities. The cash flows from the swap contracts are expected to be highly effective in hedging the variability in future cash flows attributable to fluctuations in the underlying SOFR rate. 
 In accordance with ASC Topic 815, if a hedging item is terminated prior to maturity for a cash settlement, the existing gain or loss within AOCI will continue to be reclassified into earnings during the period or periods in which the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings unless it is probable that the forecasted transaction will not occur by the end of the originally specified time period. These transactions are reevaluated on a monthly basis to determine if the hedged forecasted transactions are still probable of occurring. If at a subsequent evaluation, it is determined that the transactions are probable of not occurring, any related gains or losses recorded in AOCI are immediately recognized in earnings. During the third quarter of 2024, we terminated three interest rate swap contracts designated as a cash flow hedge, and during the second quarter of 2023, we terminated one interest rate swap contract designated as a cash flow hedge. At the time of termination, we determined the hedged forecasted transactions were still probable of occurring. The existing loss in AOCI will be reclassified into earnings in the same periods the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings. 
 Fair Value Hedges 
 Gains and losses on derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges, as well as the change in fair value of the hedged item, are recorded in interest income in the consolidated statements of income. Gains and losses due to changes in fair value of the interest rate swap agreements offset changes in the fair value of the hedged portion of the hedged item. During 2022, we entered into partial term fair value hedges for certain of our fixed rate callable AFS municipal securities. During 2024, we entered into partial term fair value hedges of fixed rate AFS MBS and fixed rate loans using the portfolio layer method. This approach allows us to designate as the hedged item a stated amount of the assets that are not expected to be affected by prepayments, defaults and other factors affecting the timing and amount of cash flows. The fair value portfolio level hedging adjustment on our hedged MBS portfolio and hedged loan portfolio has not been attributed to the individual AFS securities or individual loans in our balance sheet. The instruments are designated as fair value hedges as the changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap are expected to offset changes in the fair value of the hedged item attributable to changes in the SOFR swap rate, the designated benchmark interest rate. These derivative contracts involve the receipt of floating rate interest from a counterparty in exchange for us making fixed-rate payments over the life of the agreement, without the exchange of the underlying notional value. During 2024 and 2023, we terminated some of our securities fair value hedging relationships and sold the majority of the hedged items. As a result of the sale, the cumulative adjustments to the carrying amount was a fair value net gain of million and million recognized in earnings and recorded in noninterest income during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and year ended December 31, 2023, respectively.

 million and a loss of million, respectively, at September 30, 2024. There were discontinued hedges as of December 31, 2023. 
 Derivatives Designated as Non-Hedging Instruments 
 From time to time, we may enter into certain interest rate swaps, cap and floor contracts that are not designated as hedging instruments. These interest rate derivative contracts relate to transactions in which we enter into an interest rate swap, cap or floor with a customer while concurrently entering into an offsetting interest rate swap, cap or floor with a third-party financial institution. We agree to pay interest to the customer on a notional amount at a variable rate and receive interest from the customer on a similar notional amount at a fixed interest rate. At the same time, we agree to pay a third-party financial institution the same fixed interest rate on the same notional amount and receive the same variable interest rate on the same notional amount. These interest rate derivative contracts allow our customers to effectively convert a variable rate loan to a fixed rate loan. The changes in the fair value of the underlying derivative contracts primarily offset each other and do not significantly impact our results of operations. We recognized swap fee income associated with these derivative contracts immediately based upon the difference in the bid/ask spread of the underlying transactions with the customer and the third-party financial institution. The swap fee income is included in other noninterest income in our consolidated statements of income. 
 At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, net derivative assets included million and million, respectively, of cash collateral received from counterparties under master netting agreements. 
 The notional amounts of the derivative instruments represent the contractual cash flows pertaining to the underlying agreements. These amounts are not exchanged and are not reflected in the consolidated balance sheets. The fair value of the interest rate swaps are presented at net in other assets and other liabilities and in the net change in each of these financial statement line items in the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows when a right of offset exists, based on transactions with a single counterparty that are subject to a legally enforceable master netting agreement.

 Derivatives Derivatives are reported at fair value utilizing Level 2 inputs. We obtain fair value measurements from sources including an independent pricing service and the counterparty to the derivatives designated as hedges. The fair value measurements consider observable data that may include dealer quotes, market spreads, the U.S. Treasury yield curve, live trading levels, trade execution data, credit information and the derivatives terms and conditions, among other things. We review the prices supplied by the sources for reasonableness. In addition, we obtain a basic understanding of their underlying pricing methodology. We validate prices supplied by the sources by comparison to one another.

The higher ETR for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to a decrease in net tax-exempt income as a percentage of pre-tax income as compared to the same period in 2023. The ETR differs from the statutory rate of 21 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 primarily due to the effect of tax-exempt income from municipal loans and securities, as well as BOLI.

 Contractual commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer provided the terms established in the contract are met. Commitments to extend credit generally have fixed expiration dates and may require the payment of fees. Since some commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. Standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. These guarantees are primarily issued to support public and private borrowing arrangements. The credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in commitments to extend credit and similarly do not necessarily represent future cash obligations. 
 Standby letters of credit Total 
 
 We apply the same credit policies in making commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit as we do for on-balance-sheet instruments. We evaluate each customer s creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral obtained, if deemed necessary, upon extension of credit is based on management s credit evaluation of the borrower. Collateral held varies but may include cash or cash equivalents, negotiable instruments, real estate, accounts receivable, inventory, oil, gas and mineral interests, property, plant and equipment. 
 Leases . There were operating lease ROU assets obtained in exchange for new operating lease liabilities during the three months ended September 30, 2024 or 2023.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 The following is a discussion of our consolidated financial condition, changes in our financial condition and results of our operations, and should be read and reviewed in conjunction with the financial statements, and the notes thereto, in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, and in our 2023 Form 10-K. Certain risks, uncertainties and other factors, including those set forth under Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A. of the 2023 Form 10-K and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, may cause actual results to differ materially from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements appearing in this discussion and analysis. 
 Forward-Looking Statements 
 Certain statements of other than historical fact that are contained in this report may be considered to be forward-looking statements within the meaning of and subject to the safe harbor protections of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance, nor should they be relied upon as representing management s views as of any subsequent date. These statements may include words such as expect, estimate, project, anticipate, appear, believe, could, should, may, might, will, would, seek, intend, probability, risk, goal, target, objective, plans, potential, and similar expressions. Forward-looking statements are statements with respect to our beliefs, plans, expectations, objectives, goals, anticipations, assumptions, estimates, intentions and future performance and are subject to significant known and unknown risks and uncertainties, which could cause our actual results to differ materially from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. For example, benefits of the Share Repurchase Plan, trends in asset quality, capital, liquidity, our ability to sell nonperforming assets, expense reductions, planned operational efficiencies and earnings from growth and certain market risk disclosures, including the impact of interest rates and our expectations regarding rate increases, tax reform, inflation, the impacts related to or resulting from other economic factors are based upon information presently available to management and are dependent on choices about key model characteristics and assumptions and are subject to various limitations. By their nature, certain of the market risk disclosures are only estimates and could be materially different from what actually occurs in the future. Accordingly, our results could materially differ from those that have been estimated. The most significant factor that could cause future results to differ materially from those anticipated by our forward-looking statements include the ongoing impact of higher inflation levels, interest rate fluctuations and general economic and recessionary concerns, all of which could impact economic growth and could cause a reduction in financial transactions and business activities, including decreased deposits and reduced loan originations, our ability to manage liquidity in a rapidly changing and unpredictable market, labor shortages and changes in interest rates by the Federal Reserve. Other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, the following: 
 general (i) political conditions, including, without limitation, governmental action and uncertainty resulting from U.S. and global political trends and (ii) economic conditions, either globally, nationally, in the State of Texas, or in the specific markets in which we operate, including, without limitation, the deterioration of the commercial real estate, residential real estate, construction and development, energy, oil and gas, credit or liquidity markets, which could cause an adverse change in our net interest margin, or a decline in the value of our assets, which could result in realized losses, as well as the risk of an economic slowdown or recession; 
 inflation and fluctuations in interest rates that reduce our margins and yields, the fair value of financial instruments, the level of loan originations or prepayments on loans we have made and make, and the cost we pay to retain and attract deposits and secure other types of funding;

 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 Our accounting and reporting estimates conform with U.S. GAAP and general practices within the financial services industry. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. We consider accounting estimates that can (1) be replaced by other reasonable estimates and/or (2) changes to an estimate from period to period that have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition, changes in financial condition or results of operations as well as (3) those estimates that require significant and complex assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain to be critical accounting estimates. We consider our critical accounting estimates to include allowance for credit losses on loans and off-balance-sheet credit exposure. 
 Critical accounting estimates include a high degree of uncertainty in the underlying assumptions. Management bases its estimates on historical experience, current information and other factors deemed relevant. The development, selection and disclosure of our critical accounting estimates are reviewed with the Audit Committee of the Company s Board of Directors. Actual results could differ from these estimates. For additional information regarding critical accounting policies, refer to Part II Item 7.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 Certain non-GAAP measures are used by management to supplement the evaluation of our performance. These include the following fully taxable-equivalent measures: Net interest income (FTE), net interest margin (FTE) and net interest spread (FTE), which include the effects of taxable-equivalent adjustments using a federal income tax rate of 21 to increase tax-exempt interest income to a tax-equivalent basis. Interest income earned on certain assets is completely or partially exempt from federal income tax. As such, these tax-exempt instruments typically yield lower returns than taxable investments. 
 Net interest income (FTE), net interest margin (FTE) and net interest spread (FTE). Net interest income (FTE) is a non-GAAP measure that adjusts for the tax-favored status of net interest income from certain loans and investments and is not permitted under GAAP in the consolidated statements of income. We believe this measure to be the preferred industry measurement of net interest income, and that it enhances comparability of net interest income arising from taxable and tax-exempt sources. The most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP is our net interest income. Net interest margin (FTE) is the ratio of net interest income (FTE) to average earning assets. The most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP is our net interest margin. Net interest spread (FTE) is the difference in the average yield on average earning assets on a tax-equivalent basis and the average rate paid on average interest bearing liabilities. The most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP is our net interest spread. 
 These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered alternatives to GAAP-basis financial statements and other bank holding companies may define or calculate these non-GAAP measures or similar measures differently. Whenever we present a non-GAAP financial measure in an SEC filing, we are also required to present the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP and reconcile the differences between the non-GAAP financial measure and such comparable GAAP measure. 
 In the following table we present the reconciliation of net interest income to net interest income adjusted to a fully taxable-equivalent basis assuming a 21 marginal tax rate for interest earned on tax-exempt assets such as municipal loans and investment securities (dollars in thousands), along with the calculation of net interest margin (FTE) and net interest spread (FTE).

Tax-equivalent adjustments are reported in the respective earning asset categories as listed in the Average Balances with Average Yields and Rates tables under Results of Operations.

OVERVIEW 
 ECONOMIC CONDITIONS 
 The economic conditions and growth prospects for our markets, even against the headwinds of elevated inflation, interest rate fluctuations and potential recessionary concerns, continue to reflect a solid and positive overall outlook. Ongoing inflation levels and continued higher interest rates could have a negative impact on both our consumer and commercial borrowers. Currently, however, the Texas markets we serve continue to remain healthy due to both job and population growth. 
 DEPOSITS 
 Our deposits were 6.44 billion at September 30, 2024, a decrease of 114.0 million, or 1.7 , from December 31, 2023. At September 30, 2024, we had 179,214 total deposit accounts with an average balance of 32,000. Our estimated uninsured deposits were 35.9 of total deposits as of September 30, 2024. When excluding affiliate deposits (Southside-owned deposits) and public fund deposits (all collateralized), our total estimated deposits without insurance or collateral was 19.2 of total deposits as of September 30, 2024. 
 Our noninterest bearing deposits represent approximately 21.4 of total deposits. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, our cost of interest bearing deposits increased 43 basis points from 2.58 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 3.01 . Our cost of total deposits for the third quarter of 2024 increased 40 basis points from 1.98 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 2.38 . 
 Our cost of interest bearing deposits increased 83 basis points, from 2.16 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, to 2.99 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Our cost of total deposits increased 75 basis points, from 1.62 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, to 2.37 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY 
 Our capital ratios and contingent liquidity sources remain solid. We utilized the Federal Reserve s BTFP to reduce our overall funding costs and to enhance our interest rate risk position. On March 11, 2024, the Federal Reserve stopped extending new BTFP advances. As of September 30, 2024, we had no remaining BTFP borrowings, compared to 117.7 million at a cost of 4.37 at December 31, 2023. 
 The table below shows our total lines of credit, borrowings, total amounts available for future liquidity, and swapped value as of September 30, 2024 (in thousands):

 Operating Results 
 Net income increased 2.1 million, or 11.2 , to 20.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023. The increase in net income was a result of the 4.6 million decrease in the provision for credit losses and the 2.2 million increase in net interest income, partially offset by the 2.7 million decrease in noninterest income, the 779,000 increase in noninterest expense, and the 1.3 million increase in income tax expense. Earnings per diluted common share was 0.68 and 0.60 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our net income decreased 2.7 million, or 3.8 , to 66.7 million from 69.4 million for the same period in 2023. The decrease in net income was primarily a result of the 3.9 million decrease in noninterest income, the 3.6 million increase in noninterest expense, and the 2.0 million increase in income tax expense, partially offset by the 4.9 million decrease in provision for credit losses and the 1.9 million increase in net interest income. Earnings per diluted common share decreased 0.04, or 1.8 , to 2.20 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 2.24 for the same period in 2023.

Financial Condition 
 Our total assets increased 77.3 million, or 0.9 , to 8.36 billion at September 30, 2024 from 8.28 billion at December 31, 2023. Our securities portfolio increased by 93.5 million, or 3.6 , to 2.70 billion, compared to 2.60 billion at December 31, 2023. The increase in the securities portfolio was due to purchases of MBS, partially offset by a decrease in municipal bonds during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Our FHLB stock increased 28.4 million, or 237.6 , to 40.3 million from 11.9 million at December 31, 2023, due to the increase in our FHLB borrowings during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Loans at September 30, 2024 were 4.58 billion, an increase of 53.5 million, or 1.2 , compared to December 31, 2023, due to increases of 254.2 million in commercial real estate loans and 58.7 million in 1-4 family residential loans. The increases were partially offset by decreases of 203.9 million in construction loans, 39.1 million in municipal loans, 8.2 million in loans to individuals and 8.0 million in commercial loans. Loans held for sale decreased 10.1 million, or 93.0 , to 768,000 at September 30, 2024 from 10.9 million at December 31, 2023 due to the sale of a 7.9 million commercial real estate loan relationship during the first quarter of 2024. 
 Our nonperforming assets at September 30, 2024 increased 3.7 million, or 91.4 , to 7.7 million and represented 0.09 of total assets, compared to 4.0 million, or 0.05 of total assets, at December 31, 2023. Nonaccruing loans increased 3.4 million, or 86.5 , to 7.3 million, and the ratio of nonaccruing loans to total loans was 0.16 and 0.09 for September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The increase in nonaccrual loans was primarily due to one commercial real estate loan added during the third quarter of 2024. There were no restructured loans as of September 30, 2024, compared to 13,000 at December 31, 2023. Repossessed assets were 14,000 at September 30, 2024. There were no repossessed assets at December 31, 2023. There was 388,000 and 99,000 of OREO at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 Our deposits decreased 114.0 million, or 1.7 , with a balance of 6.44 billion at September 30, 2024 from 6.55 billion at December 31, 2023, which consisted of decreases of 100.6 million in interest bearing deposits and 13.4 million in noninterest bearing deposits. 
 Total FHLB borrowings increased 547.4 million, or 257.4 , to 760.0 million at September 30, 2024 from 212.6 million at December 31, 2023. 
 Other borrowings decreased 404.0 million, or 79.2 , to 105.8 million at September 30, 2024, from 509.8 million at December 31, 2023, which was primarily due to a 275.0 million decrease in borrowings from the FRDW and a 117.7 million decrease in borrowings from the BTFP. 
 Our total shareholders equity at September 30, 2024 increased 4.1 , or 32.0 million, to 805.3 million, or 9.6 of total assets, compared to 773.3 million, or 9.3 of total assets, at December 31, 2023. The increase in shareholders equity was the result of net income of 66.7 million, stock compensation expense of 2.5 million, net issuance of common stock under employee stock plans of 1.1 million and common stock issued under our dividend reinvestment plan of 886,000, partially offset by cash dividends paid of 32.7 million, other comprehensive loss of 5.0 million and repurchases of 1.5 million of our common stock. 
 Key financial indicators management follows include, but are not limited to, numerous interest rate sensitivity and interest rate risk indicators, credit risk, operations risk, liquidity risk, capital risk, regulatory risk, inflation risk, competition risk, yield curve risk, U.S. agency MBS prepayment risk and economic risk indicators.

Balance Sheet Strategy 
 Determining the appropriate size of the balance sheet is one of the critical decisions any bank makes. Our balance sheet is not merely the result of a series of micro-decisions, but rather the size is controlled based on the economics of assets compared to the economics of funding and funding sources. Changing interest rate environments and economic conditions require that we monitor the interest rate sensitivity of the assets, the funding driving our growth and closely align ALCO objectives accordingly. 
 We ended the third quarter of 2024 with approximately 352.6 million in available liquidity from the FRDW, in addition to the approximately 1.80 billion credit line available from FHLB due primarily to the blanket lien on our loan portfolio and to a lesser extent, securities available as collateral. At September 30, 2024, the estimated deposits, without insurance or collateral, to total deposits, excluding affiliate deposits (Southside-owned deposits) was 19.2 , or 1.24 billion. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we entered into an additional 50 million cash flow hedge interest rate swap contract while 150 million cash flow hedge interest rate swap contracts were terminated and 120 million matured. At September 30, 2024, FHLB advances of 310 million and brokered deposits of 480 million were hedged with our 790 million of cash flow swaps. As of September 30, 2024, a pre-tax unrealized gain of 6.8 million was recognized in other comprehensive income, and there was no ineffective portion of these hedges. We continue to evaluate the lowest cost wholesale funding sources and will utilize either brokered deposits, FHLB advances or FRDW borrowings, or a combination of the three funding sources in addition to utilizing cash flow hedges to mitigate the impacts of interest rate movements. At September 30, 2024, the majority of the securities portfolio was funded by non-maturity deposits, some of which are included in wholesale funding that accounts for approximately 57 of the funding source, of which approximately 51 is swapped at a fixed rate, providing protection from rising interest rates. 
 We utilize wholesale funding and securities to enhance overall profitability to determine the appropriate leverage of our capital, determining acceptable levels of credit, interest rate and liquidity risk consistent with prudent capital management. This balance sheet strategy currently consists of borrowing funds from the brokered market, FHLB and the FRDW. These funds are invested primarily in U.S. agency MBS and long-term municipal securities and to a lesser extent, U.S. Treasury Bills and corporate securities. Although the securities purchased often carry lower yields than loans, these securities generally (i) increase the overall quality of our assets because of either the implicit or explicit guarantees of the U.S. Government, and the guarantees of the municipalities, (ii) are more liquid than individual loans and (iii) may be used to collateralize our borrowings or other obligations. 
 Risks associated with this asset structure include a potentially lower net interest rate spread and margin when compared to our peers, changes in the slope of the yield curve, increased interest rate risk, the length of interest rate cycles, changes in volatility or spreads associated with the MBS, municipal and corporate securities, the unpredictable nature of MBS prepayments and credit risks associated with the municipal and corporate securities. See Part I - Item 1A. Risk Factors Risks Related to Our Business in the 2023 Form 10-K for a discussion of risks related to interest rates. An additional risk is significant increases in interest rates, especially long-term interest rates, which could adversely impact the fair value of the AFS securities portfolio and could also impact our equity capital. Due to the unpredictable nature of MBS prepayments, the length of interest rate cycles and the slope of the interest rate yield curve, net interest income could fluctuate more than simulated under the scenarios modeled by our ALCO and described under Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 Our securities portfolio increased from 2.60 billion at December 31, 2023 to 2.70 billion at September 30, 2024. The increase in the securities portfolio was due to securities purchased during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, which more than offset sales of securities and principal payments. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we continued to adjust the composition of the securities portfolio as U.S. Treasury Bills and MBS increased while the remaining categories in the portfolio decreased. The increase in MBS was attributable to purchases of U.S. Agency MBS, partially offset by MBS principal payments. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we purchased 482.9 million in short-term U.S. Treasury Bills to collateralize public fund deposits and 289.0 million in low premium, primarily 5.0 to 6.5 coupon MBS and to a lesser extent, discounted 4.0 to 5.5 coupon MBS. Sales during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 included 128.8 million in municipal securities and in most instances the unwinding of the related fair value hedges to align the investment portfolio with the current balance sheet strategy. Sales of AFS securities and the related fair value hedge unwinds for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 resulted in a net realized loss of 1.9 million and 2.5 million, respectively. In addition, during the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded an impairment loss of 868,000 on the sale of approximately 10.0 million in AFS municipal securities and the unwind of the related fair value hedges, sold on October 1, 2024. 
 At September 30, 2024, securities as a percentage of assets totaled 32.3 , compared to 31.4 at December 31, 2023, due to a 93.5 million, or 3.6 , increase in securities, while cash and cash equivalents decreased to 5.8 of total assets at

September 30, 2024, compared to 6.8 at December 31, 2023. Our balance sheet management strategy is dynamic and is continually evaluated as market conditions warrant. 
 During 2022, we entered into partial term fair value hedges for certain of our fixed rate callable AFS municipal securities. During 2024, we entered into partial term fair value hedges of fixed rate AFS MBS and fixed rate municipal loans using the portfolio layer method. The instruments are designated as fair value hedges as the changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap are expected to partially offset changes in the fair value of the hedged item attributable to changes in the SOFR swap rate, the designated benchmark interest rate. As of September 30, 2024, hedged municipal securities with a carrying amount of 336.9 million are included in our AFS securities portfolio in our consolidated balance sheets representing approximately 77 of the AFS municipal portfolio. As of September 30, 2024, 201.0 million in hedging instruments were used to hedge a layer of the closed portfolio of AFS MBS with a carrying value of 632.1 million, or 81 of the AFS MBS portfolio, and 155.0 million in hedging instruments were used to hedge a layer of the closed portfolio of municipal loans. These derivative contracts involve the receipt of floating rate interest from a counterparty in exchange for us making fixed-rate payments over the life of the agreement, without the exchange of the underlying notional value. 
 With respect to funding sources, we primarily utilize deposits and to a lesser extent wholesale funding to achieve our strategy of minimizing cost while achieving overall interest rate risk objectives as well as the liability management objectives of the ALCO. Our primary wholesale funding sources are FHLB, brokered deposits and borrowings from the FRDW. Our FHLB borrowings increased 257.4 , or 547.4 million, to 760.0 million at September 30, 2024 from 212.6 million at December 31, 2023. 
 As of September 30, 2024, our total wholesale funding as a percentage of deposits, not including brokered deposits, increased to 27.1 from 25.5 at December 31, 2023 and 23.3 at September 30, 2023. 
 Our brokered deposits may consist of CDs and non-maturity deposits. We had 126.4 million in brokered CDs at September 30, 2024. We had no brokered CDs at December 31, 2023. At September 30, 2024, our brokered CDs had a weighted average cost of 517 basis points and remaining maturities of approximately less than 11 months. Our brokered non-maturity deposits decreased to 627.2 million at September 30, 2024, of which 480.0 million are related to our cash flow hedges, from 828.0 million at December 31, 2023, with a weighted average cost of 345 and 323 basis points, respectively. Our wholesale funding policy currently allows for maximum brokered deposits of the lesser of 1.05 billion, or 12 of total assets. Potential higher interest expense and lack of customer loyalty are risks associated with the use of brokered deposits. 
 In connection with 790.0 million of our wholesale funds, the Bank has entered into various variable rate agreements and fixed or variable rate short-term pay agreements with an interest rate tied to SOFR. In connection with 790.0 million and 1.01 billion of the agreements outstanding at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, the Bank also entered into various interest rate swap contracts that are treated as cash flow hedges under ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging that are expected to be effective in hedging the variability in future cash flows at 2.70 with a remaining average weighted maturity of 1.8 years at September 30, 2024. Refer to Note 11 Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedging Activities in our consolidated financial statements included in this report for a detailed description of our hedging policy and methodology related to derivative instruments.

Results of Operations 
 Our results of operations are dependent primarily on net interest income, which is the difference between the interest income earned on assets (loans and investments) and interest expense due on our funding sources (deposits and borrowings) during a particular period. Results of operations are also affected by our noninterest income, provision for credit losses, noninterest expenses and income tax expense. General economic and competitive conditions, particularly changes in interest rates, changes in interest rate yield curves, prepayment rates of MBS and loans, repricing of loan relationships, government policies and actions of regulatory authorities also significantly affect our results of operations. Future changes in applicable law, regulations or government policies may also have a material impact on us.

 Net interest income is one of the principal sources of a financial institution s earnings stream and represents the difference or spread between interest and fee income generated from interest earning assets and the interest expense paid on interest bearing liabilities. Fluctuations in interest rates or interest rate yield curves, as well as repricing characteristics and volume and changes in the mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities, materially impact net interest income. During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Federal Reserve increased the target federal funds rate by 100 basis points to 5.25 to 5.50 . During the third quarter of 2024, the Federal Reserve reduced target federal funds rate by 50 basis points to 4.75 to 5.00 . If the federal funds rate remains elevated or increases further, it may negatively impact our net interest income. 
 Net interest income for the three months ended September 30, 2024, increased 2.2 million, or 4.1 , compared to the same period in 2023. The increase in net interest income for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was due to the increases in the average balance and the average yield of interest earning assets, partially offset by increases in the average rate paid on our interest bearing liabilities and the average balance of our interest bearing liabilities. Total interest income increased 12.6 million, or 13.6 , to 105.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 93.1 million during the same period in 2023. Total interest expense increased 10.4 million, or 26.2 , to 50.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 39.8 million for the same period in 2023. Our net interest margin and net interest margin (FTE), a non-GAAP measure, decreased to 2.82 and 2.95 , respectively, for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 2.85 and 3.02 , respectively, for the same period in 2023, and our net interest spread and net interest spread (FTE), also a non-GAAP measure, decreased to 2.10 and 2.23 , respectively, compared to 2.14 and 2.31 , respectively, for the same period in 2023. See Non-GAAP Financial Measures for more information and a reconciliation to GAAP.

Net interest income was 162.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 160.5 million for the same period in 2023, an increase of 1.9 million, or 1.2 . The increase in net interest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was due to increases in the average balance and the average yield of interest earning assets, partially offset by increases in the average rate paid on our interest bearing liabilities and average balance of our interest bearing liabilities. Total interest income increased 51.8 million, or 19.9 , to 312.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 260.8 million for the same period in 2023. Total interest expense increased 50.0 million, or 49.8 , to 150.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 100.3 million for the same period in 2023. Our net interest margin and net interest margin (FTE), a non-GAAP measure, decreased to 2.76 and 2.90 , respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 2.95 and 3.13 , respectively, for the same period in 2023, and our net interest spread and net interest spread (FTE), also a non-GAAP measure, decreased to 2.04 and 2.18 , respectively, compared to 2.31 and 2.48 , respectively, for the same period in 2023. See Non-GAAP Financial Measures for more information and for a reconciliation to GAAP. 
 Quarterly Analysis of Changes in Interest Income and Interest Expense 
 The following table presents on a fully taxable-equivalent basis, a non-GAAP measure, the net change in net interest income and sets forth the dollar amount of increase (decrease) in the average volume of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and from changes in yields/rates. Volume/Yield/Rate variances (change in volume times change in yield/rate) have been allocated to amounts attributable to changes in volumes and to changes in yields/rates in proportion to the amounts directly attributable to those changes (in thousands). The comparison between the quarters includes an additional change factor that shows the effect of the difference in the number of days in each period for assets and liabilities that accrue interest based upon the actual number of days in the period.

 The increase in total interest income for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was attributable to a 404.9 million, or 5.5 , increase in the average balance of interest earning assets for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023, as well as an increase in the average yield on interest earning assets to 5.51 from 5.15 for the same period in 2023. The increase in total interest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was primarily attributable to the increase in interest rates on our interest bearing liabilities to 3.28 from 2.84 for the same period in 2023, and an increase in the average balance of our interest bearing liabilities of 519.9 million, or 9.3 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023. The increase in average earning assets was primarily the result of the

Noninterest Income 
 Noninterest income consists of revenue generated from a broad range of financial services and activities and other fee-generating services that we either provide or in which we participate. 
 The following table details the categories included in noninterest income (dollars in thousands): 
 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 Change From 2024 2023 2023 Deposit services 6,199 6,479 (280) (4.3) Net gain (loss) on sale of securities AFS (1,929) 11 (1,940) (17,636.4) Gain (loss) on sale of loans 115 96 19 19.8 Trust fees 1,628 1,522 106 7.0 BOLI 857 790 67 8.5 Brokerage services 1,068 760 308 40.5 Other noninterest income 233 1,178 (945) (80.2) Total noninterest income 8,171 10,836 (2,665) (24.6) 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Change From 2024 2023 2023 Deposit services 18,341 19,192 (851) (4.4) Net gain (loss) on sale of securities AFS (2,510) (5,590) 3,080 55.1 Net gain on sale of equity securities 5,058 (5,058) (100.0) Gain (loss) on sale of loans (101) 385 (486) (126.2) Trust fees 4,420 4,479 (59) (1.3) BOLI 3,408 3,221 187 5.8 Brokerage services 3,163 2,361 802 34.0 Other noninterest income 2,731 4,227 (1,496) (35.4) Total noninterest income 29,452 33,333 (3,881) (11.6) 
 The 24.6 decrease in noninterest income for the three months ended September 30, 2024, when compared to the same period in 2023, was due to a net loss on sale of securities AFS and decreases in other noninterest income and deposit services income, partially offset by an increase in brokerage services income. The 11.6 decrease in noninterest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, when compared to the same period in 2023, was due to decreases in the net gain on sale of equity securities, other noninterest income and deposit services income and a loss on sale of loans. These decreases were partially offset by a decrease in net loss on sale of securities AFS and an increase in brokerage services income. 
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we sold municipal securities that resulted in a net loss on sale of AFS securities of 1.9 million and 2.5 million, respectively. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we sold equity securities that resulted in a net gain of 5.1 million. 
 Gain on sale of loans increased for the three months ended September 30, 2024, when compared to the same period in 2023, due to an increase in the balance of loans sold. The loss on sale of loans for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was due to the 412,000 net loss on the sale of a commercial real estate loan relationship during the first quarter of 2024. 
 Brokerage services income increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, when compared to the same periods in 2023, due to an increase in assets under management. 
 Other noninterest income decreased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, when compared to the same periods in 2023, due to an impairment loss of 868,000 for AFS securities which were sold on October 1, 2024 and a decrease in mortgage servicing fee income, partially offset by an increase in equity investment income. Additional decreases in other noninterest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, when compared to the same period in 2023, include a decrease in the gain recognized on the repurchase of our subordinated notes at a discount and a decrease in swap fee income.

 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Change From 2024 2023 2023 Salaries and employee benefits 67,330 64,473 2,857 4.4 Net occupancy 10,725 11,220 (495) (4.4) Advertising, travel entertainment 2,479 2,966 (487) (16.4) ATM expense 1,105 1,033 72 7.0 Professional fees 3,435 4,036 (601) (14.9) Software and data processing 8,667 6,751 1,916 28.4 Communications 1,282 1,034 248 24.0 FDIC insurance 2,859 2,666 193 7.2 Amortization of intangibles 922 1,327 (405) (30.5) Other noninterest expense 10,174 9,889 285 2.9 Total noninterest expense 108,978 105,395 3,583 3.4 
 The increase in noninterest expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, when compared to the same periods in 2023, was due to increases in salaries and employee benefits and software and data processing expense, partially offset by decreases in advertising, travel and entertainment expense, professional fees, net occupancy expense and amortization of intangibles. 
 Salaries and employee benefits expense increased during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same periods in 2023, due to increases in direct salary expense, retirement expense and health insurance expense. 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, direct salary expense increased 312,000, or 1.7 , and 1.9 million, or 3.4 , respectively, when compared to the same periods in 2023, primarily due to normal salary increases effective in the first quarter of 2024 and approximately 618,000 associated with future cost reductions. 
 Retirement expense, included in salaries and employee benefits, increased 400,000, or 73.8 , and 701,000, or 34.0 , for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, when compared to the same periods in 2023. This increase was due to increases in our split dollar expense, deferred compensation expense, 401(k) matching expense and post-retirement benefits expense. 
 Health and life insurance expense, included in salaries and employee benefits, increased 279,000, or 14.1 , and 237,000, or 3.9 , for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, when compared to the same periods in 2023, due to an increase in health claims expense. We have a self-insured health plan which is supplemented with a stop loss policy.

Net occupancy expense decreased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, when compared to the same periods in 2023, primarily due to decreases in repairs and depreciation expense. 
 Advertising, travel and entertainment expense decreased for the three months ended September 30, 2024, when compared to the same period in 2023, due to decreases in travel related expenses, advertising expense and donations. Advertising, travel and entertainment expense decreased for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, when compared to the same period in 2023, due to decreases in travel related expenses, advertising, media advertising and registration fees. 
 Professional fees decreased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, when compared to the same periods in 2023, due to decreases in legal and consulting fees. 
 Software and data processing expense increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, when compared to the same periods in 2023, due to new software contracts and increases in existing contract renewal costs. 
 Communications expense increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, when compared to the same periods in 2023, driven by initial costs related to a project to improve network management efficiency. 
 Amortization of intangibles decreased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, when compared to the same periods in 2023, due primarily to a decrease in core deposit intangible amortization which is recognized on an accelerated method resulting in a decline in expense over the amortization period. 

Income Taxes 
 Pre-tax income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 24.9 million and 80.9 million, respectively, an increase of 15.5 , compared to 21.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and a decrease of 0.8 compared to 81.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. We recorded income tax expense of 4.4 million and 14.2 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to income tax expense of 3.1 million and 12.2 million for the same periods in 2023. The ETR as a percentage of pre-tax income was 17.6 for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to an ETR as a percentage of pre-tax income of 14.5 and 15.0 for the same periods in 2023. The increase in the ETR for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily a result of a decrease in net tax-exempt income as a percentage of pre-tax income as compared to the same periods in 2023. The increase in income tax expense is due to the higher ETR for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods in 2023. 
 The ETR differs from the statutory rate of 21 primarily due to the effect of tax-exempt income from municipal loans and securities, as well as BOLI. The net deferred tax asset totaled 32.6 million at September 30, 2024, compared to 30.4 million at December 31, 2023. The increase in the net deferred tax asset is primarily the result of a decrease in the estimated fair value of the hedging derivatives. 
 See Note 11 Income Taxes to our consolidated financial statements included in this report. No valuation allowance was recorded at September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023, as management believes it is more likely than not that all of the deferred tax asset items will be realized in future years.

Composition of Loans 
 One of our main objectives is to seek attractive lending opportunities in Texas, primarily in the market areas in which we operate. Refer to Part I Item 1. Business Market Area in the 2023 Form 10-K for a discussion of our primary market area and the geographic concentration of our loan portfolio as of December 31, 2023. There were no substantial changes in these concentrations during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The majority of our loan originations are made to borrowers who live in and/or conduct business in the market areas of Texas in which we operate or adjoin, with the exception of municipal loans, which are made primarily throughout the state of Texas. Municipal loans are made to municipalities, counties, school districts and colleges. 
 The following table sets forth loan totals by class as of the dates presented (dollars in thousands): 
 Compared to December 31, 2023 September 30, 2023 September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 September 30, 2023 Change ) Change ) Real estate loans: Construction 585,817 789,744 720,515 (25.8) (18.7) 1-4 family residential 755,406 696,738 689,492 8.4 9.6 Commercial 2,422,612 2,168,451 2,117,306 11.7 14.4 Commercial loans 358,854 366,893 385,816 (2.2) (7.0) Municipal loans 402,041 441,168 441,512 (8.9) (8.9) Loans to individuals 53,318 61,516 65,992 (13.3) (19.2) Total loans 4,578,048 4,524,510 4,420,633 1.2 3.6 
 Our total loan portfolio increased 53.5 million, or 1.2 , and 157.4 million, or 3.6 , at September 30, 2024 compared to December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2023, respectively, with net increases in commercial real estate and 1-4 family loans, partially offset by decreases in construction, commercial loans, municipal loans and loans to individuals. 
 At September 30, 2024, our real estate loans represented 82.2 of our loan portfolio and were comprised of commercial real estate loans of 64.4 , 1-4 family residential loans of 20.0 and construction loans of 15.6 . Commercial real estate loans primarily include loans collateralized by retail, commercial office buildings, multi-family residential buildings, medical facilities and offices, senior living, assisted living and skilled nursing facilities, warehouse facilities, hotels and churches. Our 1-4 family residential loans consist primarily of loans secured by first mortgages on owner occupied 1-4 family residences. Our construction loans are collateralized by property located primarily in or near the market areas we serve. A number of our construction loans will be owner occupied upon completion. Construction loans for non-owner occupied projects are financed, but these typically have cash flows from leases with tenants, secondary sources of repayment, and in some cases, additional collateral. 
 Nonperforming Assets 
 Nonperforming assets consist of delinquent loans 90 days or more past due, nonaccrual loans, OREO, repossessed assets and restructured loans. Nonaccrual loans are loans 90 days or more delinquent and collection in full of both the principal and interest is not expected. Additionally, some loans that are not delinquent or that are delinquent less than 90 days may be placed on nonaccrual status if it is probable that we will not receive contractual principal and interest payments in accordance with the terms of the respective loan agreements. When a loan is categorized as nonaccrual, the accrual of interest is discontinued and any accrued balance is reversed for financial statement purposes. OREO represents real estate taken in full or partial satisfaction of debts previously contracted. The dollar amount of OREO is based on a current evaluation of the OREO at the time it is recorded on our books, net of estimated selling costs. Updated valuations are obtained as needed and any additional impairments are recognized. We actively market all OREO properties and do not hold them for investment purposes. Restructured loans represent loans that have been modified due to the borrower experiencing financial difficulty to provide interest rate reductions or below market interest rates, restructuring amortization schedules and other actions intended to minimize potential losses. Categorization of a loan as nonperforming is not in itself a reliable indicator of potential loan loss. Other factors, such as the value of collateral securing the loan and the financial condition of the borrower are considered in judgments as to potential loan loss.

Allowance for Credit Losses Loans 
 In accordance with ASC 326, the allowance for credit losses on loans is estimated and recognized upon origination of the loan based on expected credit losses. The CECL model uses historical experience and current conditions for homogeneous pools of loans, and reasonable and supportable forecasts about future events. The impact of varying economic conditions and portfolio stress factors are a component of the credit loss models applied to each portfolio. Reserve factors are specific to the loan segments that share similar risk characteristics based on the probability of default assumptions and loss given default assumptions, over the contractual term. The forecasted periods gradually mean-revert the economic inputs to their long-run historical trends. Management evaluates the economic data points used in the Moody s forecasting scenarios on a quarterly basis to determine the most appropriate impact to the various portfolio characteristics based on management s view and applies weighting to various forecasting scenarios as deemed appropriate based on known and expected economic activities. Management also considers and may apply relevant qualitative factors, not previously considered, to determine the appropriate allowance level. The use of the CECL model includes significant judgment by management and may differ from those of our peers due to different historical loss patterns, economic forecasts, and the length of time of the reasonable and supportable forecast period and reversion period. 
 We utilize Moody s Analytics economic forecast scenarios and assign probability weighting to those scenarios which best reflect management s views on the economic forecast. The probability weighting and scenarios utilized for the estimate of the allowance were generally reflective of continued economic and repricing uncertainty forecasted in our CECL model as of September 30, 2024. 
 When determining the appropriate allowance for credit losses on our loan portfolio, our commercial construction and real estate loans, commercial loans and municipal loans utilize the probability of default/loss given default discounted cash flow approach. Reserves on these loans are based upon risk factors including the loan type and structure, collateral type, leverage ratio, refinancing risk and origination quality, among others. Our consumer construction real estate loans, 1-4 family residential loans and our loans to individuals use a loss rate based upon risk factors including loan types, origination year and credit scores.

Loans evaluated collectively in a pool are monitored to ensure they continue to exhibit similar risk characteristics with other loans in the pool. If a loan does not share similar risk characteristics with other loans, expected credit losses for that loan are evaluated individually. 
 As of September 30, 2024, our review of the loan portfolio indicated that an allowance for loan losses of 44.3 million was appropriate to cover expected losses in the portfolio. Changes in economic and other conditions, including the application of the CECL model may require future adjustments to the allowance for loan losses. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the allowance for loan losses increased 1.6 million, or 3.8 , to 44.3 million, or 0.97 of total loans, when compared to 42.7 million, or 0.94 of total loans at December 31, 2023. 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, loan charge-offs were 773,000 and 2.1 million, respectively, and recoveries were 365,000 and 1.2 million, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, loan charge-offs were 1.3 million and 2.6 million, respectively, and recoveries were 378,000 and 1.2 million, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded a provision for credit losses for loans of 2.3 million and 2.6 million, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded a provision for credit losses for loans of 6.3 million and 6.7 million, respectively. 

Allowance for Credit Losses Off-Balance-Sheet Credit Exposures 
 
 Allowance for off-balance-sheet credit exposures were as follows (in thousands): 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Balance at beginning of period 3,208 3,207 3,932 3,687 Provision for (reversal of) off-balance-sheet credit exposures 112 646 (612) 166 Balance at end of period 3,320 3,853 3,320 3,853 
 Our off-balance-sheet credit exposures include contractual commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit. For these credit exposures we evaluate the expected credit losses using usage given defaults and credit conversion factors depending on the type of commitment and based upon historical usage rates. These assumptions are reevaluated on an annual basis and adjusted if necessary. For additional information regarding our methodology used to estimate the allowance for credit losses on off-balance-sheet credit exposures, see Note 12 Off-Balance-Sheet Arrangements, Commitments and Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements included in this report.

Capital Resources and Liquidity 
 Our total shareholders equity at September 30, 2024 increased 4.1 , or 32.0 million, to 805.3 million, or 9.6 of total assets, compared to 773.3 million, or 9.3 of total assets, at December 31, 2023. The increase in shareholders equity was the result of net income of 66.7 million, stock compensation expense of 2.5 million, net issuance of common stock under employee stock plans of 1.1 million and common stock issued under our dividend reinvestment plan of 886,000, partially offset by cash dividends paid of 32.7 million, other comprehensive loss of 5.0 million and repurchases of 1.5 million of our common stock. 
 The Company s Common Equity Tier 1 capital includes common stock and related paid-in capital, net of treasury stock, and retained earnings. The Bank s Common Equity Tier 1 capital includes common stock and related paid-in capital, and retained earnings. In connection with the adoption of the Basel III Capital Rules, we elected to opt-out of the requirement to include accumulated other comprehensive income in Common Equity Tier 1. We also elected, for a five-year transitional period, the effects of credit loss accounting under CECL from Common Equity Tier 1, as further discussed below. Common Equity Tier 1 for both the Company and the Bank is reduced by goodwill and other intangible assets, net of associated deferred tax liabilities. 
 Tier 1 capital includes Common Equity Tier 1 capital and additional Tier 1 capital. For the Company, additional Tier 1 capital at September 30, 2024 included 58.5 million of trust preferred securities. For bank holding companies that had assets of less than 15 billion as of December 31, 2009, trust preferred securities issued prior to May 19, 2010 can be treated as Tier 1 capital to the extent that they do not exceed 25 of Tier 1 capital after the application of capital deductions and adjustments. The Bank did not have any additional Tier 1 capital beyond Common Equity Tier 1 at September 30, 2024. 
 
 Total capital includes Tier 1 capital and Tier 2 capital. Tier 2 capital for both the Company and the Bank includes a permissible portion of the allowance for credit losses on loans and off-balance sheet exposures. Tier 2 capital for the Company also includes 92.0 million of qualified subordinated debt as of September 30, 2024. The permissible portion of qualified subordinated notes decreases 20 per year during the final five years of the term of the notes. 
 In April 2020, the FDIC, Federal Reserve, and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency issued supplemental instructions allowing banking organizations that implement CECL before the end of 2020, the option to delay for two years an estimate of the CECL methodologies effect on regulatory capital, relative to the incurred loss methodologies effect on capital, followed by a three-year transition period. We elected to adopt the five-year transition option. In accordance with CECL guidance, a CECL transitional amount totaling 2.0 million has been added back to CET1 as of September 30, 2024, representing 25 of the 8.2 million transitional amount at December 31, 2023. 
 Management believes that, as of September 30, 2024, we met all capital adequacy requirements to which we were subject. It is management s intention to maintain our capital at a level acceptable to all regulatory authorities and future dividend payments will be determined accordingly. Regulatory authorities require that any dividend payments made by either us or the Bank not exceed earnings for that year. Accordingly, shareholders should not anticipate a continuation of the cash dividend payments simply because of the existence of a dividend reinvestment program. The payment of dividends will depend upon future earnings, our financial condition and other related factors including the discretion of the Board.

Management of Liquidity 
 Liquidity management involves our ability to convert assets to cash with minimum risk of loss while enabling us to meet our current and future obligations to our customers at any time. This means addressing (1) the immediate cash withdrawal requirements of depositors and other fund providers; (2) the funding requirements of lines and letters of credit; and (3) the short-term credit needs of customers. Liquidity is provided by cash, interest earning deposits and short-term investments that can be readily liquidated with a minimum risk of loss. At September 30, 2024, these investments were 10.8 of total assets, as compared with 8.9 for December 31, 2023 and 6.3 for September 30, 2023. The increase to 10.8 at September 30, 2024 as compared to December 31, 2023, is reflective of an increase in the short-term investment portfolio, partially offset by a decrease in interest earning deposits and an increase in total assets. The increase at September 30, 2024 as compared to September 30, 2023, is reflective of increases in interest earning deposits, the short-term investment portfolio and to a lesser extent, cash and due from banks, partially offset by an increase in total assets. Liquidity is further provided through the matching, by time period, of rate sensitive interest earning assets with rate sensitive interest bearing liabilities. The Bank has three unsecured lines of credit for the purchase of overnight federal funds at prevailing rates with Frost Bank, Amegy Bank and TIB The Independent Bankers Bank for 40.0 million, 25.0 million and 15.0 million, respectively. There were no federal funds purchased at September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023. To provide more liquidity in response to economic conditions in recent years, the Federal Reserve has encouraged broader use of the discount window. At September 30, 2024, the amount of additional funding the Bank could obtain from the FRDW, collateralized by securities, was approximately 352.6 million. There were 25.0 million of borrowings from the FRDW at September 30, 2024, and 300.0 million at December 31, 2023. To provide more stability and to assure banks have the ability to meet the needs of all of their depositors, the Federal Reserve created the BTFP in the first quarter of 2023. On March 11, 2024, the Federal Reserve stopped extending new BTFP advances. There were no remaining borrowings from the BTFP at September 30, 2024 compared to 117.7 million at December 31, 2023. At September 30, 2024, the amount of additional funding the Bank could obtain from FHLB, collateralized by securities, FHLB stock and nonspecified loans and securities, was approximately 1.80 billion, net of FHLB stock purchases required. The Bank has a 5.0 million line of credit with Frost Bank to be used to issue letters of credit, and at September 30, 2024, the line had one outstanding letter of credit for 155,000. The Bank currently has has one outstanding letter of credit from FHLB held as collateral for its public fund deposits for 6.1 million. 
 Interest rate sensitivity management seeks to avoid fluctuating net interest margins and to enhance consistent growth of net interest income through periods of changing interest rates. The ALCO closely monitors various liquidity ratios and interest rate spreads and margins. The ALCO utilizes a simulation model to perform interest rate simulation tests that apply various interest rate scenarios including immediate shocks and MVPE to assist in determining our overall interest rate risk and the adequacy of our liquidity position. In addition, the ALCO utilizes this simulation model to determine the impact on net interest income of various interest rate scenarios. By utilizing this technology, we can determine changes that need to be made to the asset and liability mix to minimize the change in net interest income under these various interest rate scenarios.

 ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 The disclosures set forth in this item are qualified by the section captioned Forward-Looking Statements included in Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this report and other cautionary statements set forth elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 Refer to the discussion of market risks included in Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk in the 2023 Form 10-K. 
 In the banking industry, a major risk exposure is changing interest rates. The primary objective of monitoring our interest rate sensitivity, or risk, is to provide management the tools necessary to manage the balance sheet to minimize adverse changes in net interest income as a result of changes in the direction and level of interest rates. Federal Reserve monetary control efforts, the effects of deregulation, economic uncertainty and legislative changes have been significant factors affecting the task of managing interest rate sensitivity positions in recent years. 
 In an attempt to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates, management closely monitors our exposure to interest rate risk through our ALCO. Our ALCO meets regularly and reviews our interest rate risk position and makes recommendations to our board for adjusting this position. In addition, our board regularly reviews our asset/liability position. We primarily use two methods for measuring and analyzing interest rate risk: net income simulation analysis and MVPE modeling. We utilize the net income simulation model as the primary quantitative tool in measuring the amount of interest rate risk associated with changing market rates. This model quantifies the effects of various interest rate scenarios on projected net interest income and net income over the next 12 months. The model is used to measure the impact on net interest income relative to a base case scenario of rates immediately increasing 100 and 200 basis points or decreasing 50, 100 and 200 basis points over the next 12 months. These simulations incorporate assumptions regarding balance sheet growth and mix, pricing and the repricing and maturity characteristics of the existing and projected balance sheet. The impact of interest rate-related risks such as prepayment, basis and option risk are also considered. The model has interest rate floors and no interest rates are assumed to go negative. We continue to monitor interest rates and anticipate rate changes during the remainder of 2024. 
 The following table reflects the noted increases and decreases in interest rates under the model simulations and the anticipated impact on net interest income relative to the base case over the next 12 months for the periods presented. 
 Anticipated impact over the next 12 months September 30, Rate projections: 2024 2023 Increase: 100 basis points 4.49 3.14 200 basis points 7.41 6.53 Decrease: 50 basis points (2.19) (2.22) 100 basis points (3.34) (4.71) 200 basis points (3.62) (9.60)

As part of the overall assumptions, certain assets and liabilities are given reasonable floors. This type of simulation analysis requires numerous assumptions including but not limited to changes in balance sheet mix, prepayment rates on mortgage-related assets and fixed rate loans, cash flows and repricing of all financial instruments, changes in volumes and pricing, future shapes of the yield curve, relationship of market interest rates to each other (basis risk), credit spread and deposit sensitivity. Assumptions are based on management s best estimates but may not accurately reflect actual results under certain changes in interest rates. 
 Economic conditions and growth prospects are currently impacted by record inflation, continued higher interest rates and potential recessionary concerns. Furthermore, worker shortages and inflationary conditions have had some impact on the level of economic growth in our market areas. Ongoing inflation levels and higher interest rates could have a negative impact on the financial condition of both our consumer and commercial borrowers. 
 The ALCO monitors various liquidity ratios to ensure a satisfactory liquidity position for us. Management continually evaluates the condition of the economy, the pattern of market interest rates and other economic data to determine the types of investments that should be made and at what maturities. Using this analysis, management from time to time assumes calculated interest sensitivity gap positions to maximize net interest income based upon anticipated movements in the general level of interest rates. Regulatory authorities also monitor our gap position along with other liquidity ratios. In addition, as described above, we utilize a simulation model to determine the impact of net interest income under several different interest rate scenarios. By utilizing this model, we can determine changes that need to be made to the asset and liability mixes to mitigate the change in net interest income under these various interest rate scenarios.
