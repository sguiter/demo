sales of available-for-sale securities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Fair Value Measurements Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. The Company measures financial assets and liabilities at fair value at each reporting period using a fair value hierarchy which requires the Company to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. A financial instrument s classification within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Three levels of inputs may be used to measure fair value: Level 1 . Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 . Inputs other than Level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data. Level 3 . Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities, including pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies and similar techniques.

It further requires that a change in judgment related to the expected ultimate resolution of uncertain tax positions to be recognized in earnings in the period in which such determination is made. The Company will continue to review its tax positions and provide for, or reverse, unrecognized tax benefits as issues arise. As of September 30, 2024, there was no material increase in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits and no accrued interest or penalties related to uncertain tax positions.

million of unrecognized tax benefits of which million was netted against deferred tax assets with a full valuation allowance. If these amounts are recognized, there will be a tax benefit of million against the Company s effective tax rate. The Company files income tax returns in the U.S. federal, California, and foreign jurisdictions with varying statutes of limitations. The Company is generally no longer subject to tax examinations for years prior to 2020 for federal purposes and 2019 for state purposes, except in certain limited circumstances. In California, the Company's net operating loss NOL and credit carryforwards from all years may be subject to adjustment for four years for California following the year in which utilized. Currently, the Company has California NOLs and credit carryforwards from 2012 which remain subject to adjustment for four years following the year in which utilized, and therefore tax years 2012 through 2023 may remain open for state audit. The Company does not anticipate that any potential tax adjustments will have a significant impact on its financial position or results of operations. The CHIPS and Science Act of 2022 ("CHIPS") and the Inflation Reduction Act ("IRA") of 2022 were signed into law by President Biden on August 9, 2022 and August 16, 2022, respectively. The legislation introduces new options for monetizing certain credits, a corporate alternative minimum tax, and a stock repurchase excise tax. The Company has concluded that the impact of any of the provisions included in CHIPS and IRA acts did not have a material impact on the Company's unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements as of and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

 Overview 
 We are a fabless semiconductor company that designs, markets and sells mixed-signal integrated circuits for multiple video applications in the automotive and security surveillance markets. Our integrated circuits are enabling the transition from standard definition SD video to high definition HD video in the automotive and security surveillance markets. 
 Our solutions take HD video signals from a camera and convert them into analog signals for reliable long-distance transmission, then convert the HD analog signal into the appropriate format for video processing and display. Our HD analog technology operates at the same 1080p HD resolution as digital HD, but processes video in an HD analog format and transmits the video in this same analog format, thereby eliminating the need for any compression or decompression. Our integrated circuits are based on our proprietary architecture and mixed signal technologies that we believe provide high video quality, enable high levels of integration and are cost effective. 
 We derive our revenue from sales of our mixed-signal integrated circuits into the automotive and security surveillance markets. We began shipping our products in 2013 and to date, we have sold over 475 million integrated circuits. Our revenue was 51.6 million and 47.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The automotive market accounted for 73 and 66 of our revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The security surveillance market accounted for 27 and 34 of our revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. We recognized 37.6 million and 31.2 million of revenue on sales into the automotive market for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. In addition, we recognized 14.0 million and 15.8 million of revenue on sales into the security surveillance market for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. We recorded net income of 13.8 million and 12.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 We sell our products to distributors that fulfill third-party orders for our products. We also sell directly to OEM and ODM. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we derived substantially all of our revenue from products sold to distributors as compared to products sold to OEM and ODM directly. 
 We undertake significant product development efforts well in advance of a product s release and in advance of receiving purchase orders. Our product development efforts, which are focused on developing new designs with broad demand and potential for future derivative products, typically take from six to twenty-four months until production begins, depending on the product s complexity. If we secure a design win, we believe the system designer is likely to continue to use the same or enhanced versions of our product across a number of their models, extending the life cycles of our products. Conversely, if a competitor secures the design win, it may be difficult for us to sell into the end-customer s application for an extended period. Our sales cycle typically ranges from one to three years for the automotive market and three to six months for the security surveillance market. Due to the length of our product development and sales cycle, the majority of our revenue for any period is likely to be weighted toward products introduced for sale in the prior one or two years. As a result, our present revenue is not necessarily representative of future sales because our future sales are likely to be comprised of a different mix of products, some of which are now in the development stage. 
 We employ a fabless manufacturing strategy and use market-leading suppliers for all phases of the manufacturing process, including wafer fabrication, assembly, testing and packaging. This strategy significantly reduces the capital investment that would otherwise be required to operate manufacturing facilities of our own. 
 We have made significant investments in research and development in order to develop our products to attract and retain end-customers. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, our research and development expense was 6.5 million and 5.3 million, respectively. Our research and development expenses can vary from period-to-period and can be significantly impacted 
 21 

by the number of tape-outs and new products that we initiate in any given period. As of September 30, 2024, we had 103 employees, 39 of whom are in research and development. Our headquarters are located in San Jose, California, with additional operations in Japan, Taiwan, China and South Korea. 
 Effective October 9, 2019, the U.S. Commerce Department s Bureau of Industry and Security BIS added Hikvision, a customer that represented 21 and 25 of our revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, to the BIS Entity List with a license requirement for all items subject to the Export Administration Regulations EAR ). The BIS Entity List is a published list of the names of certain foreign persons, including businesses, research institutions, government and private organizations and individuals, that are subject to specific governmental license requirements for the export, reexport and/or transfer of specified items. These license requirements could make it more difficult to ship, or in some cases, prevent the shipment of products to certain foreign persons named on the BIS Entity List. 
 We have taken action to confirm whether our products are subject to EAR. We have retained the continuous assistance of outside experts and, following Hikvision s designation on the BIS Entity List, performed a comprehensive review of our products and manufacturing operations. Based on that review, we concluded that our products are not subject to EAR. Therefore, our products may continue to be shipped to Hikvision without a U.S. export license, even though Hikvision appears on the BIS Entity List. 
 On November 12, 2020, President Trump issued Executive Order 13959 on Addressing the Threat from Securities Investments that Finance Communist Chinese Military Companies which prohibits any transaction in publicly traded securities, or any securities that are derivative of, or are designed to provide investment exposure to such securities, of any identified Communist Chinese military company, which included Hikvision. On June 3, 2021, President Biden issued Executive Order 14032 amending the prior Executive Order. As amended, Executive Order 13959 continues to prohibit certain transactions involving the purchase or sale of publicly traded securities of designated companies. Restrictions are applicable to certain entities designated as Chinese Military-Industrial Complex Companies who have been placed on the CMIC List. Hikvision was listed in the Annex to Executive Order 14032 and is currently on the CMIC List. However, Hikvision is not on the Specially Designated Nationals (SDN) List and the restrictions imposed by these Executive Orders are not expected to directly impact our business. 
 On November 11, 2021, President Biden signed into law the Secure Equipment Act of 2021, pursuant to which the U.S. Federal Communications Commission FCC adopted rules on November 11, 2022 clarifying that it will no longer review or approve any application for equipment authorization for equipment that is on the list of covered communications equipment or services published by the FCC under section 2(a) of the Secure and Trusted Communications Networks Act of 2019. Items on the FCC s covered list include video surveillance and telecommunications equipment produced by Hikvision, to the extent it is used for the purpose of public safety, security of government facilities, physical security surveillance of critical infrastructure, and other national security purposes, including telecommunications or video surveillance services provided by such entity or using such equipment. The restrictions imposed by the FCC pursuant to the Secure Equipment Act of 2021 impact imports of certain Hikvision equipment into the United States by eliminating the ability of Hikvision to obtain FCC approval for its video surveillance and telecommunications equipment. In a pending rulemaking proceeding, the FCC is considering the adoption of new rules to revoke past authorization issued for Hikvision equipment, but the FCC actions taken to date are currently not expected to directly impact our business. This may or may not directly impact our revenue in the future. In the event there is an impact on our revenue, we believe that it would be gradual and limited in scope both because Hikvision continues to sell its currently approved products in the U.S. and because other manufacturers that incorporate our products could take market share from Hikvision in the U.S. We believe that our revenue would decrease only a few percentage points even if Hikvision s business is fully impacted by the restrictions to be imposed by the FCC that limit Hikvision s ability to import its future products into the U.S. Additionally, we plan to continue growing our revenue from new and existing customers, thus further limiting the impact of the restrictions to be imposed by the FCC that impact the importation of certain of Hikvision s future products into the U.S. 
 The above conclusions are as of the date of filing of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. It is possible that changes in U.S. regulations or policies in the future may impose restrictions, including the imposition of license requirements or even a full or partial prohibition, on our sale of products to Hikvision. 
 Key Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations 
 The following are key factors that impact our results of operations: 
 Macroeconomic and Geopolitical Conditions. We have been impacted by adverse macroeconomic and geopolitical conditions. These conditions include but are not limited to inflation, foreign currency fluctuations, and supply chain challenges. Management continues to actively monitor the impact of these conditions on the Company s financial condition, liquidity, operations, end-customers (including its significant end-customers), distributors, suppliers, industry, and workforce. The extent to which such events impact the Company s business, prospects and results of operations will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain. 
 22 

Ability to attract and retain customers that make large orders. While we expect the composition of our end-customers to change over time, our business and operating results depend on our ability to continually target new and retain existing end-customers that make large orders. Hikvision, the largest security surveillance manufacturer in China, is one of our significant end-customers, as previously noted. Although large customers can help us increase our revenue and improve our results of operations, reliance on large customers is a risk to our business. For example, Section 889 of the 2019 National Defense Authorization Act could adversely impact our business with Hikvision. Section 889(a)(1)(A) went into effect on August 13, 2019 and prohibits U.S. government agencies from procuring or obtaining equipment or services that use covered telecommunications equipment or services as a substantial or essential component or critical technology, including certain video surveillance products or telecommunications equipment and services produced or provided by Hikvision. On July 14, 2020, the U.S. government issued an interim final rule that implements Section 889(a)(1)(B) effective as of August 13, 2020. This rule prohibits the U.S. government from entering into contracts with persons who use covered telecommunications equipment or services as a substantial or essential component of any system, or as critical technology as part of any system, which again includes certain of Hikvision s video surveillance products. Although Section 889 does not prohibit commercial sales of video surveillance products by Hikvision in the U.S., which we understand is the predominant business Hikvision does in the U.S. with video surveillance products that incorporate our products, the impact of these new regulations and the uncertainty of U.S. and China trade relations may adversely impact our business in the future with Hikvision and other significant customers. 
 Design wins with new and existing customers. We believe our products provide high-quality HD video with an attractive combination of characteristics, at a lower overall cost than competing solutions. In order to get our solutions designed into our end-customer s products, we work with our end-customers and potential end-customers to understand their product roadmaps and strategies. We consider design wins to be critical to our future success. We define a design win as the successful completion of the evaluation stage, where an end-customer has tested our product, verified that our product meets its requirements and qualified our integrated circuits for their products. We have secured design wins with major automotive manufacturers to sell our solutions to them for automotive backup cameras. The revenue that we generate, if any, from each design win can vary significantly. Our long-term sales expectations are based on forecasts from end-customers, internal estimates of end-customer demand factoring in expected time to market for end-customer products incorporating our solutions and associated revenue potential and internal estimates of overall demand based on historical trends. 
 Pricing, product cost and gross margins of our products. Our gross margin has been and will continue to be affected by a variety of factors, including the timing of changes in pricing, shipment volumes, new product introductions, changes in product mixes, changes in our purchase price of fabricated wafers and assembly and test service costs, manufacturing yields and inventory write downs, if any. In general, newly introduced products and products with higher performance and more features tend to be priced higher than older, more mature products. Average selling prices in the semiconductor industry typically decline as products mature. Consistent with the historical trend, we expect that the average selling prices of our products will, in the longer term, decline as our product lines mature. In the normal course of business, we will seek to offset the effect of declining average selling prices on existing products by reducing manufacturing costs and introducing new and higher value-added products. If we are unable to maintain overall average selling prices or offset any declines in average selling prices with realized savings on product costs, our gross margin will decline. 
 Product adoption and safety regulations in the automotive market. We have secured design wins with major automotive equipment manufacturers to sell our solutions to them for automotive backup cameras. Certain jurisdictions have passed laws and regulations requiring that all new cars sold after a certain date must contain back-up cameras, including with respect to cars sold in the United States after May 2018. If these jurisdictions do not maintain and implement these rules, or if back-up cameras are not put into automobiles sold in other locations as well, or do so more slowly than we expect, our financial results could be adversely affected. 
 Investment in growth. We have invested, and intend to continue to invest, in expanding our operations, increasing our headcount, developing our products and differentiated technologies to support our growth and expanding our infrastructure. We expect our total operating expenses to increase significantly in the foreseeable future to meet our growth objectives. We plan to continue to invest in our sales and support operations throughout the world, with a particular focus in the near term of adding additional sales and field applications personnel in the Asia-Pacific region to further broaden our support and coverage of our existing end-customer base, in addition to developing new end-customer relationships and generating design wins. We also intend to continue to invest additional resources in research and development to support the development of our products and differentiated technologies. Any investments we make in our sales and marketing organization, or research and development will occur in advance of experiencing any benefits from such investments, and the return on these investments may be lower than we expect. In addition, as we invest in expanding our operations into new areas internationally, our business and results will become further subject to the risks and challenges of operations in those locations, including potentially higher operating expenses and the impact of legal and regulatory developments.

Components of Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income 
 Revenue 
 We derive substantially all of our revenue through the sale of our products to distributors who, in turn, sell to our end-customers, which consists of OEM, ODM, contract manufacturers and design houses. Revenue is recognized in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606 after we (1) identify the contract with a customer; (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determine the transaction price; (4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (5) satisfy the performance obligation when control is transferred to the customer. 
 Cost of Revenue 
 Cost of revenue primarily consists of costs paid to our third-party manufacturers for wafer fabrication, assembly and testing of our products. To a lesser extent, cost of revenue also includes write-downs of inventory for excess and obsolete inventory, depreciation of test equipment, and expenses relating to manufacturing support activities, including personnel-related costs, logistics and quality assurance and shipping. 
 Research and Development Expenses 
 Research and development expenses consist primarily of compensation and associated costs of employees engaged in research and development, contractor costs, tape-out costs, development testing and evaluation costs, and depreciation expense. Before releasing new products, we incur charges for mask sets, prototype wafers and mask set revisions, which we refer to as tape-out costs. Tape-out costs may cause our research and development costs to increase in absolute dollars in the future as we increase our investment in new product development and headcount to support our development efforts. 
 Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 
 Selling expenses consist primarily of personnel-related costs for our sales, business development, marketing, and applications engineering activities, promotional and other marketing expenses, and travel expenses. We expect selling expenses to increase in absolute dollars for the foreseeable future as we continue to expand our sales teams and increase our marketing activities. General and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel-related costs, consulting expenses, professional fees and facility costs. Professional fees principally consist of legal, audit, tax and accounting services. We expect general and administrative expenses to increase in absolute dollars for the foreseeable future as we hire additional personnel, make improvements to our infrastructure and incur significant additional costs for the compliance requirements of operating as a U.S. company that is publicly traded in Japan, including higher legal, insurance and accounting expenses. Personnel-related costs, including salaries, benefits, bonuses and stock-based compensation, are the most significant component of each of selling expenses and general and administrative expenses. 
 Provision for Income Taxes 
 The provision for income taxes consists of our estimated federal, state and foreign income taxes based on our pre-tax income. Our provision differs from the federal statutory rate primarily due to the research and development credit, foreign derived intangible income deduction and stock-based compensation deduction.

Revenue increased by 1.0 million, or 6 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. This was primarily attributable to a 0.7 million increase in security surveillance market revenue as a result of an increase in the volume of shipments, offset by a decrease in average selling prices attributable to product mix, and a 0.3 million increase in automotive revenue as a result of an increase in the volume of shipments, offset by a decrease in average selling prices attributable to product mix. 
 Revenue increased by 4.6 million, or 10 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This was primarily attributable to a 6.4 million increase in automotive market revenue as a result of an increase in volume of shipments, offset by a decrease in average selling prices attributable to product mix. Security surveillance market revenue decreased by 1.8 million due to a decrease in the volume of shipments and a decrease in average selling price attributable to product mix. 
 Our product pricing increases or decreases in our target markets in response to our increased or decreased manufacturing costs. Additionally, fluctuations in our overall average selling price are directly attributable to changes in product mix given the natural pricing variation of the products in our portfolio and customer base. When the product mix shifts towards the higher priced products in our portfolio, the average selling price will be higher than when the product mix shifts towards the lower price point products.

Cost of revenue increased by 0.5 million, or 7 , and gross margin remained flat at 53 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. Cost of revenue increased by 2.6 million, or 12 , and gross margin decreased to 53 from 54 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. Gross margin for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was impacted by changes in product mix. We expect gross margins to fluctuate in future periods due to changes in customer and product mix, average unit selling prices, manufacturing costs, adjustments to inventory, if any, and end market product demand.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Our primary use of cash is to fund our operations as we continue to grow our business. Cash used to fund operating expenses is impacted by the timing of when we pay expenses, as reflected in the changes in our outstanding accounts payable and accrued expenses. Our cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments as of September 30, 2024 were 68.5 million. We believe our existing cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, and cash we expect to generate from operations in the future will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next 12 months. 
 In 2021, our board of directors adopted a dividend policy to link dividend payments to business performance on an ongoing basis. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, cash used in financing activities consists primarily of 9.2 million in dividend payments to holders of our common stock (including common stock underlying JDS) under this recently adopted dividend policy. 
 Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our growth rate, the timing and extent of our spending to support research and development activities, the timing and cost of establishing additional sales and marketing capabilities, the introduction of new and enhanced products and our costs to implement new manufacturing technologies or potentially acquire and integrate other companies or assets. In the event that additional financing is required from outside sources, we may not be able to raise it on terms acceptable to us or at all. Any debt financing obtained by us in the future could also involve restrictive covenants relating to our capital-raising activities and other financial and operational matters, which may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities, including potential acquisitions. Additionally, if we raise additional funds through further issuances of equity, or issue convertible debt securities or other securities convertible into equity, our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution in their percentage ownership, and any new equity securities we issue could have rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us when we require it, our ability to continue to grow or support our business and to respond to business challenges could be significantly limited. 
 A summary of operating, investing and financing activities are shown in the following table (in thousands):

Operating Activities 
 Our primary source of cash from operating activities has been from cash collections from our customers. We expect cash flows from operating activities to be affected by fluctuations in sales. Our primary uses of cash from operating activities have been for personnel costs and investments in research and development and sales and marketing. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash provided by operating activities was 10.8 million, due to net income of 13.8 million, net adjustments from non-cash charges of a 0.2 million deduction and net cash outflows from changes in operating assets and liabilities of 2.8 million. 
 Net adjustments from non-cash charges of a 0.2 million deduction primarily consisted of accretion of premium on available-for-sale investments of 1.0 million, an increase in deferred tax assets of 0.9 million, and gain on disposal of fixed asset of 0.1 million, partially offset by stock-based compensation of 1.2 million, amortization of operating lease right-of-use assets of 0.5 million, and depreciation and amortization of 0.2 million. 
 Net cash outflows from changes in operating assets and liabilities totaled 2.8 million, primarily consisting of a 4.2 million increase in inventory, net of valuation adjustment, as units manufactured during the period and on hand were in excess of product sales, a 0.3 million decrease in other liabilities, a 0.2 million decrease in lease liabilities, and a 0.2 million decrease in accounts 
 28 

payable due to the timing of vendor payments. Outflows were partially offset by the inflow from a 1.4 million increase in accrued liabilities due to the timing of customer payments, and a 0.5 million increase in customer deposit. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, net cash provided by operating activities was 17.5 million, primarily due to net income of 12.6 million, non-cash charges of 0.8 million and net cash inflows from changes in operating assets and liabilities of 4.1 million. Non-cash charges consisted of stock-based compensation of 1.1 million, amortization of operating lease right-of-use assets of 0.4 million, an increase in the inventory valuation adjustment of 0.3 million, and depreciation and amortization of 0.3 million, partially offset by an increase in deferred tax assets of 0.9 million, and accretion of premium on available-for-sale investments of 0.5 million. Net cash inflows from changes in operating assets and liabilities totaled 4.1 million, consisting of a 1.9 million decrease in inventory, net of valuation adjustment, as units manufactured during the period and on hand were less than product sales, a 1.5 million increase in customer deposit and a 1.3 million increase in accrued liabilities due to the timing of customer payments. Inflows were partially offset by outflows from a 0.4 million decrease in lease and other liabilities, and a 0.2 million increase in prepaid expense and other current asset due to timing of payments. 
 Investing Activities 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, cash provided by investing activities was 31.1 million, primarily attributable to proceeds from maturity of debt securities, net of investments in debt securities. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, cash used in investing activities was 7.9 million, primarily consisting of a 5.9 million cash outflow due to purchase of debt securities, net of proceeds from maturity of debt security, a 1.7 million in acquisition of business and intangible assets, and a 0.2 million in purchase of property and equipment. 
 Financing Activities 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, cash used in financing activities was approximately 9.3 million, primarily due to payment of dividends totaling 9.2 million in February and July, 2024. 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, cash used in financing activities was approximately 9.2 million, primarily due to payment of dividends totaling 9.1 million in February and July, 2023.

Contractual Obligations 
 Our outstanding contractual obligations as of September 30, 2024 are summarized in the following table (in thousands): 

Payments Due by Period

438 

Operating leases 

1,270 

741 

529 

Obligations under contracts that we can cancel without a significant penalty are not included in the table above. We believe our cash provided by operations is sufficient to satisfy our contractual obligations for all periods presented. 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 During the periods presented, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. 
 Critical Accounting Policies, Significant Estimates and Judgments 
 Our financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses, and related disclosures. We evaluate our estimates, assumptions, and judgments on an ongoing basis. Our estimates, assumptions and judgments are based on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different assumptions and judgments would change the estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements, which, in turn, could change the results from those reported. Please see Note 1 of Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for a summary of significant accounting policies and Part II, Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Critical Accounting Estimates of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 for a summary of our critical accounting estimates. 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 We are exposed to market risk from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, which may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. We seek to minimize these risks through regular operating activities. We do not purchase, hold or sell derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. 
 Foreign exchange rates 
 We transact business globally and are subject to risks associated with fluctuating foreign exchange rates. Substantially all of our revenue was derived from sales outside of the U.S. in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. This revenue is generated in U.S. dollars with sales through distributors worldwide. Our operating expenses are denominated in the currencies of the countries in which our subsidiaries are located and may be subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. To date, we have not entered into any hedging contracts, but may elect to do so in the future. A hypothetical increase or decrease of 10 in foreign exchange rates for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 would not have resulted in a significant increase or decrease in revenue or net income during that period. 
 The U.S. dollar is the functional currency for all of our foreign operations. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are remeasured into the functional currency of the subsidiary at the balance sheet date. The gains and losses from remeasurement of foreign currency denominated balances into the functional currency of the subsidiary are included in other income (expense), net on our condensed consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income. 
 Interest rates 
 Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our cash, cash equivalents and investments. Our cash, cash equivalents and investments consist primarily of cash, U.S. treasury bills, government agency bonds, money market funds, corporate notes and bonds, and commercial paper. The primary objectives of our investment activities are the preservation of capital, the maintenance of liquidity, and capturing a market rate of return. We seek to minimize risk by investing cash in excess of our operating needs in high-quality instruments issued by highly creditworthy financial institutions. We do not purchase investments for trading or speculative purposes. Due to the nature of these instruments, we believe that we do not have any material exposure to 
 30 

changes in the fair value of our investment portfolio as a result of changes in interest rates. Decreases in interest rates, however, would reduce future interest income. 
 A hypothetical increase or decrease of 10 in interest rates in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 would not have resulted in a significant increase or decrease in cash, cash equivalents or the fair value of our investment during those periods. 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures . 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act ), as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based on management s evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective at a reasonable assurance level. 
 In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by Rules 13a-15(d) and 15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act that occurred during the three months ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 
 31 

PART II OTHER INFORMATION 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings. 
 Although we are not currently a party to any legal proceedings, and no legal proceeding is currently threatened against us, we may be subject to legal proceedings, claims and litigation, including intellectual property litigation, arising in the ordinary course of business. Such matters are subject to many uncertainties and outcomes and are not predictable with assurance. We accrue amounts that we believe are adequate to address any liabilities related to legal proceedings and other loss contingencies that we believe may result in a probable loss that is reasonably estimable. 
 Item 1A. Ris k Factors. 
 There have been no material changes to the previously disclosed risk factors discussed in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. You should consider carefully these factors, together with all of the other information in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, before making an investment decision. 
 Item 5. Oth er Information. 
 (c) Trading Plans. 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, no director or officer or any contract, instruction or written plan for the purchase or sale of securities of the Company pursuant to Rule 10b5-1(c) or any non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement (as defined in Item 408(c) of Regulation S-K).
