WP744 Portfolio (Berubicin) 

On November 21, 2017, the Company entered into a Collaboration and
Asset Purchase Agreement with Reata Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Reata ). Through this agreement, the Company purchased all of
Reata s rights, title, interest and previously conducted research and development results in the chemical compound commonly known
as Berubicin. In exchange for these rights, the Company agreed to pay Reata an amount equal to 2.25 of the net sales of Berubicin for
a period of 10 years from the Company s first commercial sale of Berubicin plus 10,000. Reata also agreed to collaborate with the
Company on the development of Berubicin, from time to time. 

On December 28, 2017, the Company entered into a Technology Rights
and Development Agreement with Houston Pharmaceuticals, Inc. HPI ). HPI is affiliated with Dr. Waldemar Priebe, our founder.
Pursuant to this agreement, the Company obtained a worldwide exclusive license to the chemical compound commonly known as WP744. In exchange
for these rights, the Company agreed to pay consideration to HPI as follows: (i) a royalty of 2 of net sales of any product utilizing
WP744 for a period of ten years after the first commercial sale of such; and (ii) 100,000 upon beginning Phase II clinical trials (paid
in 2021); and (iii) 200,000 upon the approval by the FDA of a New Drug Application for any product utilizing WP744; and (iv) a series
of quarterly development payments totaling 750,000 beginning immediately after the Company s raise of 7,000,000 of investment
capital. In addition, the Company issued 134 shares of the Company s common stock valued at 67.50 per share to HPI upon execution
of the agreement. On November 13, 2019, the Company closed its IPO, thereby fulfilling all conditions precedent and completing the acquisition
of the intellectual property discussed in the HPI agreement. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recognized
 and related to this agreement. Unrelated to this agreement, from time to time, the Company purchases pharmaceutical products
from HPI which are necessary for the manufacturing of Berubicin API and drug product which are reviewed
and approved by the Company s audit committee based upon the standards of providing superior pricing and time to delivery than that
available from unrelated third parties. On May 14, 2024, the Company provided notice to HPI of its intent to terminate the HPI License
effective on or about July 14, 2024. 

On August 30, 2018, we entered into a sublicense agreement with WPD
Pharmaceuticals, Inc. WPD ). Pursuant to the agreement, the Company granted WPD an exclusive sublicense, even as to us,
for the patent rights we licensed pursuant to the HPI License within the following countries: Poland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Belarus,
Ukraine, Moldova, Romania, Bulgaria, Serbia, Macedonia, Albania, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Montenegro, Bosnia, Croatia, Slovenia,
Slovakia, Czech Republic, Hungary, Chechnya, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Greece, Austria, and Russia.
The sublicense agreement provides that WPD must use commercially reasonable development efforts to attempt to develop and commercialize
licensed products in the above mentioned territories, which means the expenditure of at least 2.0 million on the development, testing,
regulatory approval or commercialization of the licensed products during the three year period immediately following the date of the sublicense
agreement. In the event that WPD fails to use commercially reasonable development efforts by the foregoing three-year deadline, we have
the right to terminate this sublicense agreement. As of December 31, 2021, the Company has received reports of the WPD expenditures related
to this agreement, has conducted due inquiry into validating those expenditures, and has determined that WPD has exercised commercially
reasonable development efforts and has therefore fulfilled the terms of the agreement necessary to secure their rights under the sublicense
in perpetuity subject to the ongoing obligations of the sublicense. In consideration for the rights granted under the sublicense agreement,
to the extent we are required to make any payments to HPI pursuant to the HPI License as a result of this sublicense agreement, WPD agreed
to advance us such payments, and to pay us a royalty equal to 1 of such payments. WPD is a Polish corporation that is majority-owned
by an entity controlled by Dr. Priebe, our founder. 

On August 31, 2018, the Company entered into a sublicense agreement
with Animal Life Sciences, LLC ALI ), pursuant to which we granted ALI an exclusive sublicense, even as
to us, for the patent rights we licensed pursuant to the HPI License solely for the treatment of cancer in non-human animals through any
type of administration. In consideration for the rights granted under the sublicense agreement, ALI agreed to issue us membership interests
in ALI equal to 1.52 of the outstanding ALI membership interests. As additional consideration for the rights granted, to the extent we
are required to make any payments to HPI pursuant to the HPI License as a result of this sublicense agreement, ALI agreed to advance us
such payments, and to pay us a royalty equal to 1 of such payments. Dr. Waldemar Priebe, our founder, is also the founder of ALI. 

On June 10, 2020, the FDA granted Orphan Drug Designation ODD for Berubicin for the treatment of malignant gliomas. ODD from the FDA is available for drugs targeting diseases with less than 200,000
cases per year. ODD may enable market exclusivity of 7 years from the date of approval of an NDA in the United States. During that period
the FDA generally could not approve another product containing the same drug for the same designated indication. Orphan drug exclusivity
will not bar approval of another product under certain circumstances, including if a subsequent product with the same active ingredient
for the same indication is shown to be clinically superior to the approved product on the basis of greater efficacy or safety, or providing
a major contribution to patient care, or if the company with orphan drug exclusivity is not able to meet market demand. The ODD now constitutes
our primary intellectual property protections although the Company is exploring if there are other patents that could be filed related
to Berubicin to extend additional protections. 

On July 24, 2021, the Company received Fast Track Designation from
the FDA for Berubicin. Fast Track Designation is designed to facilitate the development and expedite the review of drugs to treat
serious conditions and fill an unmet medical need. 

WP1244 Portfolio 

On January 10, 2020, Company entered into a Patent and Technology License
Agreement (the WP1244 Agreement with The Board of Regents of The University of Texas System, an agency of the State of
Texas, on behalf of The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center UTMDACC ). Pursuant to the WP1244 Agreement, the
Company obtained a royalty-bearing, worldwide, exclusive license to certain intellectual property rights, including patent rights, related
to the Company s recently announced WP1244 drug technology. In consideration, the Company must make payments to UTMDACC including
an up-front license fee, annual maintenance fee, milestone payments and royalty payments (including minimum annual royalties) on sales
of licensed products developed under the WP1244 Agreement. The term of the WP1244 Agreement expires on the last to occur of: (a) the expiration
of all patents subject to the WP1244 Agreement, or (b) fifteen years after execution; provided that UTMDACC has the right to terminate
this WP1244 Agreement in the event that the Company fails to meet certain commercial diligence milestones. The commercial diligence milestones
are as follows (i) initiated PC toxicology to support filing of Investigational New Drug Application IND or New Drug Application NDA for the Licensed Product within the eighteen (18) month period following the Effective Date (ii) file and IND for
the Licensed Product within three (3) year period following the Effective Date and (iii) Commencement of Phase I Study within the five
(5) year period following the Effective Date. The Company has not met the commercial diligence milestones and has not paid the annual
maintenance fee required as of the date hereof. On April 25, 2024, UTMDACC provided notice to the Company of its intent to terminate the
WP1244 Agreement if the Company fails to pay the annual maintenance fee of 50,000, as well as 1,300 in expenses. On May 25, 2024 the
WP1244 Agreement was terminated. There are no termination penalty provisions in the Agreement. During the nine months ended September
30, 2024 and 2023, the Company paid 52,537 and 45,092, respectively. 

Nasdaq Capital Markets Listing Qualifications 

On September 12, 2024, the Company received a letter from the Staff
of Nasdaq notifying the Company that for the previous 30 consecutive business days the Company s common stock had not maintained
a closing bid price of 1.00 per share (the Minimum Bid Price Requirement required for continued listing on The Nasdaq
Capital Market pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2). Normally, a company would be afforded a 180-calendar day period to demonstrate
compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement. However, pursuant to Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A)(iv), the Company is not eligible
for any compliance period specified in Rule 5810(c)(3)(A) because the Company effected one or more reverse stock splits over the prior
two-year period with a cumulative ratio of 250 shares or more to one. 

The Company requested a hearing before a Hearings Panel (the Panel ),
but prior to such hearing, on October 30, 2024 the Panel provided the Company a temporary exception to regain compliance with the Minimum
Bid Price Requirement until March 11, 2025. The Panel noted that it reserves the right to reconsider the terms of this exception based
on any event, condition or circumstance that exists or develops that would, in the opinion of the Panel, make continued listing of the
Company s securities on Nasdaq inadvisable or unwarranted. The Panel notification advised the Company that the Nasdaq Listing and
Hearing Review Council may, on its own motion, determine to review any Panel decision within 45 calendar days after issuance of the written
decision. If the Listing Council determines to review the Panel s decision in the Company s matter, it may affirm, modify,
reverse, dismiss or remand the decision to the Panel.

Overview 

We are a clinical pharmaceutical company organized
as a Nevada corporation in July 2017 to focus on the development of anti-cancer drug candidates for the treatment of brain and central
nervous system tumors, based on intellectual property that we license under license agreements with Houston Pharmaceuticals, Inc. HPI and The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center UTMDACC and own pursuant to a collaboration and asset purchase
agreement with Reata Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Reata ). 

19 

We believe our lead drug candidate, Berubicin,
may be a significant development in the treatment of Glioblastoma and other CNS malignancies, and if approved by the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration FDA ), could give Glioblastoma patients an important new therapeutic alternative to the current standard
of care. Glioblastomas are tumors that arise from astrocytes, which are star-shaped cells making up the supportive tissue of the brain.
These tumors are usually highly malignant (cancerous) because the cells reproduce quickly, and they are supported by a large network of
blood vessels. Berubicin is an anthracycline, which is a class of drugs that are among the most powerful and extensively used chemotherapy
drugs known. Based on limited clinical data, we believe Berubicin is the first anthracycline that appears to cross the blood brain barrier BBB in significant concentrations targeting brain cancer cells. While our focus is currently on the development of Berubicin,
we are also in the process of attempting to secure intellectual property rights to additional compounds that we plan to develop into drugs
to treat CNS and other cancers. 

Berubicin was discovered at UTMDACC by Dr. Waldemar
Priebe, the founder of the Company. Through a series of transactions, Berubicin was initially licensed to Reata. Reata initiated several
Phase I clinical trials with Berubicin for CNS malignancies, one of which was for malignant gliomas, but subsequently allowed their IND
with the FDA to lapse for strategic reasons. This required us to obtain a new IND for Berubicin before beginning further clinical trials.
On December 17, 2020, we announced that our IND application with the FDA for Berubicin for the treatment of Glioblastoma Multiforme was
in effect. We initiated this trial for patient enrollment during the second quarter of 2021 with the first patient dosed during the third
quarter of 2021 to investigate the safety and efficacy of Berubicin in adults with Glioblastoma Multiforme who have failed first-line
therapy. The first patient on the trial was treated during the third quarter of 2021. Correspondence between the Company and the FDA resulted
in modifications to our initial trial design, including designating overall survival (OS) as the primary endpoint of the study. OS is
a rigorous endpoint that the FDA has recognized as a basis for approval of oncology drugs when a statistically significant improvement
can be shown relative to a randomized control arm. 

The current trial being conducted will evaluate
the safety and efficacy of Berubicin in patients with Glioblastoma Multiforme who have failed primary treatment for their disease, and
results will be compared to the safety and efficacy of Lomustine, a current standard of care in this setting, with a 2 to 1 randomization
of the 252 patients to Berubicin or Lomustine. Patients receiving Berubicin are administered a 2-hour IV infusion of 7.5 mg/m2 berubicin
hydrochloride daily for three consecutive days followed by 18 days off (a 21-day cycle). Lomustine is administered orally once every six
weeks. The trial design included a pre-planned, non-binding interim futility analysis. We reached the criteria required by the study protocol
to conduct this interim futility analysis, which an independent Data Safety Monitoring Board DSMB is responsible for conducting.
The DSMB s charter mandated that they review the primary endpoint, Overall Survival, as well as secondary endpoints and safety data
to determine whether the efficacy data for the risk-benefit profile warrants modification or discontinuation of the study. On December
18, 2023, we released the DSMB s recommendation which was to continue the study without modification. Management remains blinded
to the data underlying the recommendation of the DSMB. Even if Berubicin is approved, there is no assurance that patients will choose
an infusion treatment, as compared to the current standard of care, which requires oral administration. 

We do not have manufacturing facilities and all
manufacturing activities are contracted out to third parties. Additionally, we do not have a sales organization. 

On November 21, 2017, we entered into a Collaboration
and Asset Purchase Agreement with Reata (the Reata Agreement ). Pursuant to the Reata Agreement we purchased all of Reata s
intellectual property and development data regarding Berubicin, including all trade secrets, knowhow, confidential information and other
intellectual property rights. 

On December 28, 2017, we obtained the rights to
a worldwide, exclusive royalty-bearing, license to the chemical compound commonly known as Berubicin from HPI in an agreement we refer
to as the HPI License. HPI is affiliated with Dr. Priebe, who controls a majority of our shares. Under the HPI License we obtained the
exclusive right to develop certain chemical compounds for use in the treatment of cancer anywhere in the world. In the HPI License we
agreed to pay HPI: (i) development fees of 750,000 over a three-year period beginning November 2019; (ii) a 2 royalty on net sales;
(iii) a 50,000 per year license fee; (iv) milestone payments of 100,000 upon the commencement of a Phase II trial and 1.0 million upon
the approval of a New Drug Application NDA for Berubicin; and (v) 134 shares of our common stock. The patents we licensed
from HPI expired in March 2020. On May 14, 2024, the Company provided notice to HPI of its intent to terminate the HPI License effective
on or about July 14, 2024. 

20 

On June 10, 2020, the FDA granted Orphan Drug Designation ODD for Berubicin for the treatment of malignant gliomas. ODD from the FDA is available for drugs targeting diseases with
less than 200,000 cases per year. ODD may enable market exclusivity of 7 years from the date of approval of a NDA in the United States.
During that period the FDA generally could not approve another product containing the same drug for the same designated indication. Orphan
drug exclusivity will not bar approval of another product under certain circumstances, including if a subsequent product with the same
active ingredient for the same indication is shown to be clinically superior to the approved product on the basis of greater efficacy
or safety, or providing a major contribution to patient care, or if the company with orphan drug exclusivity is not able to meet market
demand. The ODD now constitutes our primary intellectual property protections although the Company is exploring if there are other patents
that could be filed related to Berubicin to extend additional protections. 

We believe we have obtained all rights and intellectual
property necessary to develop Berubicin. As stated earlier, it is our plan to obtain additional intellectual property covering other compounds
which, subject to the receipt of additional financing, may be developed into drugs for brain and other cancers. 

On January 10, 2020, we entered into a Patent and
Technology License Agreement (the WP1244 Agreement with The Board of Regents of The University of Texas System, an agency
of the State of Texas, on behalf of the UTMDACC. Pursuant to the WP1244 Agreement, we obtained a royalty-bearing, worldwide, exclusive
license to certain intellectual property rights, including patent rights, related to our portfolio of WP1244 drug technology. On April
25, 2024, UTMDACC provided notice to us if its intent to terminate the WP1244 Agreement if we fail to pay the annual maintenance fee of
 50,000, as well as 1,300 in expenses. On May 25, 2024 the WP1244 Agreement was terminated. There are no termination penalty provisions
in the Agreement. 

Results of Operations for the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024
Compared to the Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 

General and Administrative Expense 

General and administrative expense was approximately
 1,384,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to approximately 1,123,000 for the comparable period in 2023. The increase
in general and administrative expense was mainly attributable to increases of approximately 269,000 in legal and professional expenses,
 63,000 in stock- based compensation and 12,000 in other expenses, which were offset by decreases of approximately 60,000 in marketing
, advertising expenses and 23,000 in insurance expense. 

Research and Development Expense 

Research and development expense was approximately
 4,245,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to approximately 3,411,000 for the comparable period in 2023. The increase
in research and development expenses during the period were mainly attributed to license expenses related to the Cortice Agreements entered
during the quarter. 

Net Loss 

The net loss for the three months ended September
30, 2024 was approximately 5,606,000 compared to approximately 4,523,000 for the comparable period in 2023. The change in net loss
is attributable to an increase in CRO expenses related to continued progress with our potentially pivotal Phase II clinical trial of
Berubicin, as well as increases in legal and professional fees and other expenses. 

21 

Results of Operations for the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024
Compared to the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 

General and Administrative Expense 

General and administrative expense was approximately
 3,910,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to approximately 3,662,000 for the comparable period in 2023. The increase
in general and administrative expense was mainly attributable to increases of approximately 449,000 in professional expenses and
 11,000 in other expenses, which were offset by decreases of approximately 106,000 in marketing and advertising expense, 77,000 in insurance
expense and 18,000 in travel expenses and 11,000 in stock- based compensation. 

Research and Development Expense 

Research and development expense was approximately
 7,792,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to approximately 9,824,000 for the comparable period in 2023. The decrease
in research and development expenses during the period were mainly attributed to the timing of research organization (CRO) expenses related
to continued progress with our Phase II clinical trial. Our CRO expenditures are primarily for labor related to activating selected trial
sites, managing patient enrollment processes, collecting and managing data from patient treatments throughout the trial, processing reimbursement
to the sites for patient treatment, and assisting with necessary submissions to amend the IND. CRO expenditures are expected to continue
to decline throughout the remainder of the trial as the final patients complete treatment and enter follow-up. 

Net Loss 

The net loss for the nine months ended September
30, 2024 was approximately 11,681,000 compared to approximately 13,476,000 for the comparable period in 2023. The change
in net loss is attributable to a decrease in CRO expenses related to continued progress with our potentially pivotal Phase II clinical
trial of Berubicin, as well as decreases in contract labor. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

On September 30, 2024, we had cash of approximately
 6,973,000 and we had a working capital of approximately 3,331,000. We fund our operations from proceeds from equity sales.

Agent fees and other estimated offering expenses payable by the Company. 

Pursuant to the terms of the AGP ATM Sales Agreement,
the Company originally was permitted to sell from time to time through AGP, as sales agent or principal, shares of the Company s
common stock, par value 0.001 per share with initial aggregate sales price of up to 5.2 million. Subsequent to September 30, 2024, the
Company has sold 6,393,243 Shares pursuant to the Agreement for net proceeds of approximately 1.6 million. 

Our plan of operations is primarily focused on
completing a clinical trial for Berubicin. Our current expectation is that our cash on hand as of the date of this filing is sufficient
to fund our operations through the first quarter of 2025. We currently expect to release final top-line data for our potentially pivotal
trial of Berubicin in the first half of 2025. If capital is available to fund TPI 287 clinical preparations and drug manufacturing for
a potentially pivotal Phase 2 trial of TPI 287, we would need to raise an additional 4.0 million to support near-term development of
that program. The timing and costs of clinical trials are difficult to predict and trial plans may change in response to evolving circumstances
and as such the foregoing estimates may prove to be inaccurate. 

Summary of Cash Flows 

Cash used in operating activities 

Net cash used in operating activities was approximately
 11,642,000 and 11,604,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and mainly included payments made for
clinical trial preparation, officer compensation, insurance, marketing and professional fees to our consultants, attorneys and accountants. 

Cash provided by financing activities 

Net cash provided by financing activities was approximately
 18,067,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, related to the sale of common stock and exercise of warrants, which were offset
by the repayment of notes payable and payment of deferred offering costs. Net cash provided by financing activities was approximately
 2,460,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, related to the sale of common stock and exercise of warrants, which were offset
by the repayment of notes payable. 

23 

Off-balance Sheet Arrangements 

As of September 30, 2024, we did not have any relationships
with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities,
established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. 

Purchase Commitments 

We do not have any material commitments for capital
expenditures, although we are required to pay certain milestones fees to HPI, Reata and Cortice as described in the section Overview 
above. 

JOBS Act Accounting Election 

The Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012,
or the JOBS Act, exempts an emerging growth company such as us from being required to comply with new or revised financial
accounting standards until private companies are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standards. The JOBS Act
provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging
growth companies but any such election to opt out is irrevocable. We elected not to opt out of such extended transition period which means
that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies, we, as an emerging growth
company, can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard. This may make comparison
of our financial statements with another public company which is neither an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company which
has opted out of using the extended transition period difficult or impossible because of the potential differences in accounting standards
used. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 

The preparation of financial statements in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates, assumptions and judgments
that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements, including the notes thereto. As a result, management is required to routinely
make judgments and estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. Actual results may differ from these estimates
under different conditions or assumptions. Management determined there were no critical accounting estimates. 

Item 3. 
 Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 

We are a smaller reporting company as defined by
Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information required under this item. 

Item 4. 
 Controls and Procedures 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures and
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

We maintain a set of disclosure controls and procedures
designed to ensure that material information required to be disclosed in our filings under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized
and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and that material information is accumulated and communicated
to our management, including our chief executive officer, who serves as our principal executive officer, and our chief financial officer,
who serves as our principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. 

24 

Under the supervision, and with the participation
of our management, including our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness,
as of September 30, 2024, of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls
and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits
under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the issuer s management, including its principal executive officer and
principal financial officer, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Based upon such evaluation, our chief executive
officer and our chief financial officer have concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were, and
continue to be, ineffective because of the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting due to lack of segregation
of duties (resulting from the limited number of personnel available), limited access to timely and complete information regarding the
status of costs incurred in the activation of investigational sites and costs from treating patients in our study which is a result of
the use of a third-party Contract Research Organization CRO to manage the study, and the lack of formal documentation
of our control environment. Management is commencing actions to address the lack of formal documentation of our control environment, although
this will not address the lack of segregation of duties. Management is also working with the CRO to improve the timeliness and completeness
of the data reported to the Company to address this material weakness, as well as conducting increased analytical analysis of such data
to be performed by the Company. 

In light of the material weakness described above,
we continue to perform additional analysis and other post-closing procedures to ensure our financial statements are prepared in accordance
with GAAP. Accordingly, we believe that the financial statements included in this report fairly present, in all material respects, our
financial condition, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented. Additional experienced personnel will be hired in
the accounting and finance department, appropriate consultants will be retained, and our accounting system will be upgraded as soon as
it becomes economically feasible and sustainable. 

Other than as described above, there has been no
change in our internal control over financial reporting during our most recent calendar quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably
likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

25 

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1. 
 Legal Proceedings 

From time to time in the ordinary course of our
business, we may be involved in legal proceedings, the outcomes of which may not be determinable. The results of litigation are inherently
unpredictable. Any claims against us, whether meritorious or not, could be time consuming, result in costly litigation, require significant
amounts of management time and result in diversion of significant resources. We are not able to estimate an aggregate amount or range
of reasonably possible losses for those legal matters for which losses are not probable and estimable. We have insurance policies covering
potential losses where such coverage is cost effective. 

We are not at this time involved
in any legal proceedings. 

Item 1A. 
 Risk Factors 

In addition to the other information set forth
in this report, you should carefully consider the factors set forth below and discussed in the section entitled Risk Factors 
in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the SEC, which are incorporated herein by reference. The risks described in such
reports are not the only risks facing our Company. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem
to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or operating results. 

If we are unable to
maintain compliance with the listing requirements of The Nasdaq Capital Market, our common stock may be delisted from The Nasdaq Capital
Market which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and could make it more difficult for shareholders to sell
their shares. 

Our common stock is listed
on The Nasdaq Capital Market, and we are therefore subject to its continued listing requirements, including requirements with respect
to the market value of publicly-held shares, market value of listed shares, minimum bid price per share, and minimum stockholder's equity,
among others, and requirements relating to board and committee independence. If we fail to satisfy one or more of the requirements, we
may be delisted from The Nasdaq Capital Market. 

On September 12, 2024, we received a letter from
the Staff of Nasdaq notifying us that for the previous 30 consecutive business days our common stock had not maintained a closing bid
price of 1.00 per share (the Minimum Bid Price Requirement required for continued listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market
pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2). Normally, a company would be afforded a 180-calendar day period to demonstrate compliance
with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement. However, pursuant to Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A)(iv), we were not eligible for any compliance
period specified in Rule 5810(c)(3)(A) because we effected one or more reverse stock splits over the prior two-year period with a cumulative
ratio of 250 shares or more to one. We requested a hearing before a Hearings Panel (the Panel ), but prior to such hearing,
on October 30, 2024 the Panel provided us a temporary exception to regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement until March
11, 2025. The Panel noted that it reserves the right to reconsider the terms of this exception based on any event, condition or circumstance
that exists or develops that would, in the opinion of the Panel, make continued listing of our securities on Nasdaq inadvisable or unwarranted.
The Panel notification advised us that the Nasdaq Listing and Hearing Review Council may, on its own motion, determine to review any Panel
decision within 45 calendar days after issuance of the written decision. If the Listing Council determines to review the Panel s
decision in our matter, it may affirm, modify, reverse, dismiss or remand the decision to the Panel. 

26 

We were previously not in compliance with the minimum
 2,500,000 stockholders equity requirement for continued listing set forth in Listing Rule 5550(b) (the Equity Requirement ).
On September 10, 2024, we received a letter from the Nasdaq Office of General Counsel that we had demonstrated compliance with the Equity
Requirement and that the matter is closed. According to the letter, pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rule 5815(d)(4)(B), we are subject to a
Mandatory Panel Monitor for a period of one year from the date of the letter. If, within that one-year monitoring period, the Staff finds
us again out of compliance with the Equity Requirement, notwithstanding Listing Rule 5810(c)(2), we will not be permitted to provide the
Staff with a plan of compliance with respect to that deficiency and Staff will not be permitted to grant additional time for us to regain
compliance with respect to that deficiency, nor will we be afforded an applicable cure or compliance period pursuant to Listing Rule 5810(c)(3).
Instead, Staff will issue a Delist Determination Letter and we will have an opportunity to request a new hearing with the initial Panel
or a newly convened Hearings Panel if the initial Panel is unavailable. We will have the opportunity to respond/present to the Hearings
Panel as provided by Listing Rule 5815(d)(4)(C). Our common stock may be at that time delisted from Nasdaq. 

There can be no assurance
that we will continue to meet the continued listing requirements of The Nasdaq Capital Market and could be subject to delisting at a future
time. Delisting from The Nasdaq Capital Market would adversely affect our ability to raise additional financing through the public or
private sale of equity securities, may significantly affect the ability of investors to trade our securities and may negatively affect
the value and liquidity of our common stock. Delisting also could have other negative results, including the potential loss of employee
confidence, the loss of institutional investors or interest in business development opportunities. 

Item 2. 
 Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds 

Except as previously disclosed on Form 8-K, we
have not issued any unregistered securities during the quarter ended September 30, 2024. 

Item 3. 
 Defaults Upon Senior Securities 

None. 

Item 4. 
 Mine Safety Disclosures 

Not applicable. 

Item 5. 
 Other Information 

During the period covered by this Quarterly Report,
none of the Company s directors or executive officers has or a Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement or a non-Rule
10b5-1 trading arrangement (each as defined in Item 408 of Regulation S-K under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended).
