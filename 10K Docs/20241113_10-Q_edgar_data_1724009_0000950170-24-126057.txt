PERMROCK ROYALTY TRUST NOTE S TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited) 1. Organization of Trust 

 PermRock Royalty Trust (the Trust is a Delaware statutory trust formed on November 22, 2017 under the Delaware Statutory Trust Act pursuant to a trust agreement dated November 22, 2017, as amended and restated on May 4, 2018, by and among Boaz Energy II, LLC Boaz Energy ), as trustor, Simmons Bank, as trustee, and Wilmington Trust, National Association, as Delaware Trustee (the Delaware Trustee (such amended and restated trust agreement, as amended to date, the Trust Agreement ). In accordance with the successor trustee provisions of the Trust Agreement, Argent Trust Company, as successor trustee of the Trust, is subject to all terms and conditions of the Trust Agreement. The defined term Trustee as used herein shall refer to Simmons Bank (which maintains its offices at 2200 West 7th Street, Suite 210, P.O. Box 470727, Fort Worth, Texas 76147) for periods prior to December 30, 2022, and shall refer to Argent Trust Company (which maintains its offices at 3838 Oak Lawn Ave., Suite 1720, Dallas, Texas 75219) for periods on and after December 30, 2022. The Trust was created to acquire and hold the Net Profits Interest for the benefit of the Trust unitholders. In connection with the closing of the initial public offering of Trust units, on May 4, 2018, Boaz Energy conveyed the Net Profits Interest to the Trust in exchange for Trust units pursuant to a conveyance agreement between Boaz Energy, the Trustee and the Delaware Trustee (the Conveyance ). The Net Profits Interest represents an interest in the Underlying Properties. The Net Profits Interest entitles the Trust to receive 80 of the net profits from the sale of oil and natural gas production from the Underlying Properties. The Net Profits Interest is passive in nature and neither the Trust nor the Trustee has any control over, or responsibility for, costs relating to the operation of the Underlying Properties. The Trust has and will continue to make monthly cash distributions of all of its monthly cash receipts, after deduction of fees and expenses for the administration of the Trust and any cash reserves, to holders of its Trust units as of the applicable record date on or before the 10th business day after the record date. Distributions generally relate to sales from a one-month period. The Trustee may deposit funds awaiting distribution in an account with an FDIC-insured or national bank, including the Trustee, if the interest paid to the Trust at least equals amounts paid by the Trustee on similar deposits, and make other short-term investments with the funds distributed to the Trust. In May 2018, Boaz Energy completed an initial public offering of 6,250,000 of the 12,165,732 total Trust units outstanding, retaining ownership of 5,915,732 Trust units. As of November 12, 2024, Boaz Energy owned 4,884,861 Trust units of the 12,165,732 Trust units issued and outstanding. 2. Trust Significant Accounting Policies 

 a. Basis of Accounting 

 The Trust uses the modified cash basis of accounting to report Trust receipts of the Net Profits Interest and payments of expenses incurred. The Net Profits Interest represents the right to receive revenues (primarily oil and natural gas sales), less direct operating expenses, overhead expenses, lease operating expenses, severance and ad valorem taxes and development expenses of the Underlying Properties, multiplied by 80 . Cash distributions of the Trust are made based on the amount of cash received by the Trust pursuant to terms of the Conveyance creating the Net Profits Interest. The financial statements of the Trust, as prepared on a modified cash basis, reflect the Trust s assets, liabilities, Trust corpus, earnings and distributions as follows: Income from the Net Profits Interest is recorded when distributions are received by the Trust; 

 Distributions to Trust unitholders are recorded when declared by the Trust; 

 Trust general and administrative expenses (which includes the Trustee s fees as well as accounting, printing, engineering, legal, tax advisory and other professional fees) are recorded when paid; cash reserves for Trust expenses may be established by the Trustee for certain expenditures that would not be recorded as contingent liabilities under United States generally accepted accounting principles GAAP ); 

 Amortization of the investment in the Net Profits Interest is calculated on a unit-of-production basis and is charged directly to Trust corpus, and such amortization does not affect distributions from the Trust; and 

 The Trust s investment in the Net Profits Interest is periodically assessed to determine whether its aggregate value has been impaired below its total capitalized cost basis. In general, neither the Trustee nor Boaz Energy view temporarily low prices as an indication of impairment. The markets for crude oil and natural gas have a history of significant price 

6 

Table of Contents 

volatility and though prices will occasionally drop significantly, industry prices over the long term will continue to be driven by market supply and demand. If events and circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable, the Trustee would use the estimated undiscounted future net cash flows from the Net Profits Interest to evaluate the recoverability of the Trust assets. If the undiscounted future net cash flows from the Net Profits Interest are less than the Net Profits Interest carrying value, the Trust would recognize an impairment loss for the difference between the Net Profits Interest carrying value and the estimated fair value of the Net Profits Interest. The determination as to whether the Net Profits Interest is impaired is based on the best information available to the Trustee at the time of the evaluation, including information provided by Boaz Energy such as estimates of future production and development and operating expenses. Any impairment would be charged directly to the Trust corpus. 

 The financial statements of the Trust are prepared on a modified cash basis of accounting, which is considered to be the most meaningful basis of preparation for a royalty trust because monthly distributions to the Trust unitholders are based on net cash receipts. Although this basis of accounting is permitted for royalty trusts by the SEC, the financial statements of the Trust differ from financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP because net profits income is not accrued in the month of production, expenses are not recognized when incurred, cash reserves may be established for certain contingencies, and overpayments received do not need to be paid back and are instead taken from future payments that would not be recorded in GAAP financial statements. This comprehensive basis of accounting other than GAAP corresponds to the accounting permitted for royalty trusts by the SEC as specified by Staff Accounting Bulletin Topic 12:E, Financial Statements of Royalty Trusts. b. Interim Financial Statements. 

 The accompanying unaudited financial statements have been prepared by the Trust in accordance with the accounting policies stated in the audited financial statements and notes of the Trust thereto included in the Trust s 2023 Annual Report and reflect all adjustments that are, in the opinion of the Trustee, necessary to state fairly the information in the Trust s unaudited interim financial statements. c. Use of Estimates. 

 The preparation of financial statements requires the Trust to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Estimated future cash flows used to determine amortization and potential impairment of the investment in the Net Profits Interest are subject to change. d. Risks and Uncertainties. 

 The Trust s revenue and distributions are substantially dependent upon the prevailing and future prices for oil and natural gas, each of which depends on numerous factors beyond the Trust s control such as economic conditions, the global political environment, regulatory developments and competition from other energy sources. Oil and natural gas prices historically have been volatile and may be subject to significant fluctuations in the future. e. Contingencies. 

 Contingencies related to the Underlying Properties that are unfavorably resolved would generally be expected to result in reductions to cash receipts to the Trust in respect of the Net Profits Interest with corresponding reductions to cash distributions to Trust unitholders. Please see the discussion of litigation in Note 8 to condensed financial statements. 3. Income Taxes 

 Tax counsel advised the Trust at the time of formation that for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the Trust is treated as a grantor trust and will not be subject to federal income tax at the trust level. Trust unitholders will be treated for such purposes as owning a direct interest in the assets of the Trust, and each Trust unitholder is taxed directly on its pro rata share of the income and any gain, if sold, attributable to the assets of the Trust and is entitled to claim its pro rata share of deductions and expenses attributable to the assets of the Trust. Each Trust unitholder should consult his or her own tax advisor regarding income tax requirements, if any, applicable to such unitholder s ownership of Trust units. 4. Cash Reserves 

 Pursuant to the Trust Agreement, as of May 31, 2019, the Trustee began retaining cash from the distributions the Trust receives to be used by the Trust in the event that its cash on hand (including available cash reserves) is not sufficient to pay ordinary course administrative expenses as they become due. The Trustee is authorized to retain cash reserves (i) in an amount not to exceed 1,000,000 at any one time and (ii) in such amounts as the Trustee in its discretion deems appropriate to pay for future liabilities of the 

 7 

Table of Contents 

Trust, but not less than 25,000 per month or more than 100,000 per month. Cash reserves held by the Trustee for administrative expenses totaled 1,000,000 as of September 30, 2024. Boaz Energy is entitled under the Conveyance to reserve up to 3.0 million from the net profits for certain future taxes and development or operating expenses. As of December 31, 2023, the balance of funds held back to cover certain future capital expenses was 650,157 net to the Trust. As of September 30, 2024, the balance of funds held back to cover future capital expenses was 826,909 net to the Trust. 5. Distributions to Unitholders 

 The Trust makes monthly cash distributions of the net amount, if any, of its monthly cash receipts, after deduction of fees and expenses for the administration of the Trust and cash reserves to holders of its Trust units as of the applicable record date on or before the 10th business day after the record date. Based on 12,165,732 Trust units outstanding at each date listed below, the per unit distributions during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, were as follows:

6. Related Party Transactions 

 Trustee Administrative Fee . Under the terms of the Trust Agreement, the Trust pays an annual administrative fee to the Trustee and the Delaware Trustee. The Delaware Trustee s annual fee is 4,000. For 2024, the Trustee s annual administrative fee is 205,031, which is divided into twelve equal monthly payments throughout the year. The Trustee s annual administrative fee increased at a rate of 3 per year for the first three years of the Trust s existence, and increased at a rate of 2 in 2022 and 2023. The Trustee s annual administrative fee increased at a rate of 1 in 2024, and will continue to increase at a rate of 1 per year until the 20th anniversary of the Trust s formation and then will remain flat thereafter. These costs of the Trust, which are included in administration expenses, are deducted by the Trust before distributions are made to Trust unitholders. Agreements with Boaz Energy . On May 4, 2018, the Trust entered into a registration rights agreement for the benefit of Boaz Energy and certain of its affiliates and transferees, pursuant to which the Trust agreed to register the offering of the Trust units held by Boaz Energy and certain of its affiliates and permitted transferees upon request by Boaz Energy. The Trust filed a Registration Statement on Form S-3 on April 28, 2022 (the Registration Statement seeking the registration of 5,801,675 Trust units held by Boaz Energy. The SEC confirmed the effectiveness of the Registration Statement on May 9, 2022. As of November 12, 2024, Boaz Energy owned 4,884,861 Trust units of the 12,165,732 Trust units issued and outstanding. 7. Development Costs 

 Boaz Energy s estimated capital budget for 2024 for the Underlying Properties is 4.5 million, of which approximately 2.6 million has been expended as of September 30, 2024. Based on current oil and gas prices, Boaz anticipates continuing to participate in Crane and Glasscock Counties non-operated drilling and waterflood conformance and expansion work in Crane and Terry Counties, as well as drilling one new operated well in Crane County sometime in 2024. The majority of capital spent in 2024 to date was spent on returning a well to production in the Permian Shelf area, a non-operated drill well in the Permian Shelf area, and converting an existing well to an injector well in the Permian Clearfork area. The 4.5 million estimate is subject to change based on, among other things, changes in the price of oil and natural gas, Boaz Energy s actual capital requirements, the pace of regulatory approvals and the mix of projects. 8. Settlements and Litigation 

 On October 1, 2018, a lawsuit styled Thaleia L. Marston, Trustee of the Marston Trust v. Blackbeard Operating, LLC , et.al, No. 18-10-24761 CVW in the 143rd District Court in Ward County, Texas (the 2018 Litigation was filed, naming, among others, Boaz Energy and the Trust as defendants. The plaintiff is a lessor under two leases operated by Blackbeard Operating LLC. The Underlying Properties include the interests of Boaz Energy in some of the minerals covered by those leases. The litigation sought surface use damages and alleged violations of the terms of the leases, among other things. The court had set a two-day bench trial to commence May 18, 2022, but on May 10, 2022, the court granted motions for summary judgment effectively disposing of the plaintiff s claims. At a status conference conducted on May 12, 2022, the plaintiff confirmed the court s rulings disposed of all the plaintiff s claims.

Table of Contents 

The court held a hearing regarding attorneys fees in June 2022. On May 12, 2023, the court entered its final judgment, incorporating its prior order granting the defendants motion for summary judgment and granting defendants motion for attorneys fees, but the plaintiff then filed a notice of appeal to the Eighth Court of Appeals in El Paso County, Texas. The plaintiff-appellants filed their opening brief on December 11, 2023, and the defendant appellees filed an answer brief on February 22, 2024. Following a series of reply briefs filed, first by plaintiff appellants on April 14, 2024, and then by defendant appellees on May 6, 2024, the parties await an opinion from the court. 9. Subsequent Events 

 On October 21, 2024, the Trust declared a cash distribution of 0.030219 per Trust unit based upon production during the month of August 2024.

Boaz Energy Information As a holder of a net profits interest, the Trust relies on Boaz Energy for information regarding Boaz Energy and its affiliates; the Underlying Properties, including the operations, acreage, well and completion count, working interests, production volumes, sales revenues, capital expenditures, operating expenses, reserves, drilling plans, drilling results and leasehold terms related to the Underlying Properties; and factors and circumstances that have or may affect the foregoing. Overview PermRock Royalty Trust, a Delaware statutory trust formed in November 2017 by Boaz Energy, completed its initial public offering in May 2018. The Trust s main asset and source of income is the Net Profits Interest, which entitles the Trust to receive 80 of the net profits from oil and natural gas production from the Underlying Properties. The Net Profits Interest is passive in nature and neither the Trust nor the Trustee has any management control over or responsibility for costs relating to the operation of the Underlying Properties. The Trust is required to make monthly cash distributions of substantially all of its monthly cash receipts, after deduction of fees and expenses for the administration of the Trust and any cash reserves, to holders of its Trust units as of the applicable record date on or before the 10th business day after the record date. The Net Profits Interest is entitled to a share of the profits from and after January 1, 2018 attributable to production occurring on or after such date. The Trust is not subject to any pre-set termination provisions based on a maximum volume of oil or natural gas to be produced or the passage of time. The amount of Trust revenues and cash distributions to Trust unitholders depends on, among other things: volumes produced; 

 wellhead prices; 

 price differentials; 

 production and development costs; 

 potential reductions or suspensions of production; and 

 the amount and timing of Trust administrative expenses. 

 Boaz Energy typically receives payment for oil production 30 to 60 days after it is produced and for natural gas production 60 to 90 days after it is produced.

Properties . The Underlying Properties consist of four operating areas in the Permian Basin in Texas, aggregating 31,354 gross (22,394 net) acres. The Permian Clearfork area consists of 2,434 net acres on the Central Basin Platform of the Permian Basin in Hockley and Terry Counties, Texas. The Permian Abo area consists of 1,667 net acres on the Central Basin Platform of the Permian Basin in Terry and Cochran Counties, Texas. The Permian Shelf area consists of 14,390 net acres on the Eastern Shelf of the Permian Basin in Glasscock, Schleicher, Stonewall and Coke Counties, Texas. The Permian Platform area consists of 3,903 net acres on the Central Basin Platform of the Permian Basin in Ward, Crane, Terry and Ector Counties, Texas. Outlook Boaz Energy s estimated capital budget for 2024 for the Underlying Properties is 4.5 million, of which approximately 2.6 million has been expended as of September 30, 2024. Based on current oil and gas prices, Boaz anticipates continuing to participate in Crane and Glasscock Counties non-operated drilling and waterflood conformance and expansion work in Crane and Terry Counties, as well as drilling one new operated well in Crane County sometime in 2024. The majority of capital spent in 2024 to date was spent on returning a well to production in the Permian Shelf area, a non-operated drill well in the Permian Shelf area, and converting an existing well to an injector well in the Permian Clearfork area. The 4.5 million estimate is subject to change based on, among other things, changes in the price of oil and natural gas, Boaz Energy s actual capital requirements, the pace of regulatory approvals and the mix of projects. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Distributable Income Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, net profits income received by the Trust was 1,548,855 compared to 1,691,590 for the same period of the prior year. This decrease in net profits income was primarily due to decreased oil and gas production, lower natural gas prices, and higher development expenses, which were only partially offset by the higher oil prices in the same period. See Computation of Income from the Net Profits Interest Received by the Trust below. After considering interest income of 15,485 and general and administrative expenditures of 223,556, distributable income for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was 1,340,784, or 0.110208 per Trust unit. Interest income was slightly higher for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the prior year, due to higher interest rates. General and administrative expenditures decreased by 16,883 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the prior year, primarily due to the timing of payments. Pursuant to the Trust Agreement, as of May 31, 2019, the Trustee is authorized to retain cash reserves for administrative expenses. The Trustee did not retain any cash reserves during the three months ended September 30, 2024, or September 30, 2023. Total cash reserves were 1,000,000 as of September 30, 2024, and September 30, 2023. Based on 12,165,732 Trust units outstanding at each date listed below, the per unit distributions during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, were as follows:

This decrease in net profits income was primarily due to a decrease in oil and gas production and lower natural gas prices, partially offset by higher oil prices and lower production costs . See Computation of Income from the Net Profits Interest Received by the Trust below. After considering interest income of 45,056 and general and administrative expenditures of 735,415 , distributable income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was 3,813,324, or 0.313443 per Trust unit. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, total distributable income was 4,906,523, or 0.403307 per Trust unit.

Interest income increased for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the prior year, due to higher interest rates. General and administrative expenditures decreased by 33,612 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the prior year, primarily due to timing of payments and a decrease in legal expenses. Pursuant the terms of the Trust Agreement, the Trustee was authorized to begin retaining cash reserves for administrative expenses in May of 2019. The Trustee did not retain any cash reserves during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, or September 30, 2023. Total cash reserves were 1,000,000 as of September 30, 2024, and September 30, 2023. Computation of Income from the Net Profits Interest Received by the Trust The Net Profits Interest entitles the Trust to receive 80 of the net profits attributable to Boaz Energy s interest from the sale of oil and natural gas production from the Underlying Properties. The Trust s income from the Net Profits Interest consists of monthly net profits attributable to income from the Underlying Properties. Because of the interval between the time of production and receipt of net profits income by the Trust, the Trust recognizes production during the month in which the related net profits income is paid to the Trust. Net profits income for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was based on production during the months of May 2024 through July 2024. Net profits income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was based on production during the months of November 2023 through July 2024. The table below outlines the computation of income from the Net Profits Interest received by the Trust for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

(3) Boaz Energy is entitled under the Conveyance to reserve up to 3.0 million from the net profits for certain future taxes and expenses. As of September 30, 2024, Boaz had reserved 826,909 net to the Trust for future capital expenses. 

 Important factors used in calculating the Trust s net profits income include the volumes of oil and natural gas produced from the Underlying Properties and the realized prices received for the sale of those minerals, including oil and natural gas liquids, as well as direct operating expenses, lease operating expenses, severance and ad valorem taxes, development and other expenses and capital reserves. Sales Volumes Oil Oil sales volumes decreased by 6,200 Bbls (8.1 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023, and 24,360 Bbls (10.1 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023. Boaz Energy reports this decrease was primarily due to a natural decline in the producing properties and a decrease in demand. Natural Gas Natural gas sales volumes decreased by 7,896 Mcf (8.0 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023, and 38,866 Mcf (13.2 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023. Boaz Energy reports this decrease was primarily due to a natural decline in the producing properties and a decrease in demand. Sales Prices Oil The average realized oil price per Bbl increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same periods in 2023. Boaz Energy reports this increase was primarily due to an increase in the WTI benchmark oil price. Natural Gas The average realized natural gas price per Mcf decreased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same periods in 2023. Boaz Energy reports this decrease was primarily due to a decrease in the Henry Hub benchmark price for natural gas. Costs Direct Operating Expenses Direct operating expenses increased for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023. Boaz reports this increase was primarily due to additional costs to return wells to production. Direct Operating expenses decreased for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023, primarily because of fewer projects to return wells to production. Lease Operating Expenses Lease operating expenses decreased for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023, primarily because of reduced expenses on marginal wells in the Permian Shelf. Lease operating expenses decreased for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023, because of fewer projects to return wells to production. Severance and Ad Valorem Taxes Severance and ad valorem taxes decreased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same periods in 2023, primarily because of lower revenues and decreased valuations of properties resulting from decreased industry prices. Development Expenses Related to the Underlying Properties Development expenses related to the Underlying Properties increased for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023, due to stimulating and upgrading wells in the Permian Platform. Development expenses related to the Underlying Properties decreased for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023, as a result of fewer capital projects.

Other Expenses Other expenses decreased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same periods in 2023, primarily due to adjustments to overhead. Capital Reserve As of September 30, 2024, Boaz Energy had reserved 826,909 net to the Trust for future capital expenses. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES The Trust s principal sources of liquidity and capital are cash flow generated from the Net Profits Interest, the amounts held by the Trustee as cash reserves to pay future liabilities, and borrowings, if any to fund administrative expenses. The Trust s primary uses of cash are distributions to Trust unitholders, payment of Trust administrative expenses, including, if applicable, any reserves established by the Trustee for future liabilities. Administrative expenses include the Trustee and Delaware Trustee fees, accounting, engineering, legal, tax advisory and other professional fees, and tax reporting and distribution expenses. The Trust is also responsible for paying other expenses incurred as a result of being a publicly traded entity, including costs associated with annual, quarterly and current reports to the SEC, New York Stock Exchange listing fees, independent auditor fees and registrar and transfer agent fees. If the Trustee determines that cash on hand and cash to be received in respect of the Net Profits Interest are, or will be, insufficient to cover the Trust s liabilities and expenses, the Trustee may cause the Trust to borrow funds to pay liabilities of the Trust. As authorized under the Trust Agreement, the Trustee is authorized to retain cash from the distributions the Trust receives (i) in an amount not to exceed 1.0 million at any one time to be used by the Trust in the event that its cash on hand (including available cash reserves) is not sufficient to pay ordinary course administrative expenses as they become due and (ii) in such amounts as the Trustee in its discretion deems appropriate to pay for future liabilities of the Trust, but not less than 25,000 or more than 100,000 per month. Cash reserves previously retained and currently held by the Trustee for future administrative expenses total 1,000,000 as of March 31, 2024. Boaz Energy Capital Expenditure Budget Boaz Energy s estimated capital budget for 2024 for the Underlying Properties is 4.5 million, of which approximately 2.6 million has been expended as of September 30, 2024. Based on current oil and gas prices, Boaz anticipates continuing to participate in Crane and Glasscock Counties non-operated drilling and waterflood conformance and expansion work in Crane and Terry Counties, as well as drilling one new operated well in Crane County sometime in 2024. The majority of capital spent in 2024 to date was spent on returning a well to production in the Permian Shelf area, a non-operated drill well in the Permian Shelf area, and converting an existing well to an injector well in the Permian Clearfork area. The 4.5 million estimate is subject to change based on, among other things, changes in the price of oil and natural gas, Boaz Energy s actual capital requirements, the pace of regulatory approvals and the mix of projects. Distributions Declared After Quarter End On October 21, 2024, the Trust declared a cash distribution of 0.030219 per Trust unit based upon production during the month of August 2024.
