The estimated fair values of the ESAs, network affiliate agreements and trademarks were estimated using the income approach. The multi-period excess earnings method starts with a forecast of all of the expected future net cash flows associated with the asset. The forecasts are then adjusted to present value by applying an appropriate discount rate that reflects the risks associated with the company specific cash flow streams. Significant assumptions utilized within the income approach include the weighted average cost of capital and forecasted cash flows. The estimated fair values of the customer relationships were estimated using the cost approach. The cost approach included estimating the investment required to replace the contracts with customers, with significant assumptions including the replacement cost. The Company elected the practical expedients allowed in ASC 805-20-30-29a in estimating the fair value of the contract liabilities assumed. Upon NCM LLC s emergence from the Chapter 11 Case, NCM, Inc. remeasured the value of the investment in NCM LLC to the estimated fair value calculated as NCM, Inc. s percentage ownership of NCM LLC, due to NCM, Inc. s ownership of the secured debt of NCM LLC and the NCMI Capital Contribution, multiplied by the fair value of NCM LLC as of the Effective Date of million. The value of the cost investment of NCM LLC immediately prior to the Effective Date was million based upon NCM, Inc. s ownership of the secured debt of NCM LLC and an estimation of the enterprise value of NCM LLC developed utilizing discounted cash flows and comparable company analysis as of the Petition Date. The increase in the fair value resulted in a Gain on re-measurement of the investment in NCM LLC of million in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended December 28, 2023.

As such, the leases are considered short-term in nature, specifically less than one month. Within ASC 842, leases with terms of less than one month are exempt from the majority of the accounting and disclosure requirements, including disclosure of short-term lease expense.

Following the 2019 ESA Amendments, Cinemark receives an additional monthly theater access fee that began on November 1, 2019 in consideration for NCM LLC's access to certain on-screen advertising inventory after the advertised showtime of a feature film.

The digital screen fee is calculated based upon average screens in use during each month. The network affiliates compensation is considered variable lease expense and varies by circuit depending upon the agreed upon terms of the network affiliate agreement. The majority of agreements are centered around a revenue share where an agreed upon percentage of the advertising revenue received from a theater s attendance is paid to the circuit. As part of the network affiliate agreements entered into in the ordinary course of business under which the Company sells advertising for display in various network affiliate theater chains, the Company has agreed to certain minimum revenue guarantees on a per attendee basis.

 Overview 
 National CineMedia is the largest cinema advertising platform in the US. With unparalleled reach and scale, NCM connects brands to sought-after young, diverse audiences through the power of movies and pop culture. A premium video, full-funnel marketing solution for advertisers, NCM enhances marketers ability to measure and drive results. We currently derive revenue principally from the sale of advertising to national, regional and local businesses in The Noovie Show, our cinema advertising and entertainment show seen on movie screens across the U.S. 
 We present multiple formats of The Noovie Show depending on the theater circuit in which it runs, which may include Post-Showtime advertising inventory after the advertised showtime. As of September 26, 2024, theaters presenting The Noovie Show format with Post-Showtime Inventory made up approximately 65.2 of our network. All other NCM network theater circuits, which make up the remaining 34.8 of our network, present The Noovie Show, without Post-Showtime advertising inventory. The movie trailers presented by the theater circuits that run before the feature film are not part of The Noovie Show. 
 We also sell advertising on our lobby network LEN ), a series of strategically placed screens located in movie theater lobbies, as well as other forms of advertising and promotions in theater lobbies. In addition, we sell online and mobile advertising through our Noovie Audience Accelerator service , across our suite of Noovie digital properties , as well as a variety of complementary out of home venues in order to reach entertainment audiences beyond the theater. As of September 26, 2024, 7.4 million moviegoers have downloaded our mobile apps. These downloads and the acquisition of second- and third-party data have resulted in approximately 815.0 million data sets as of September 26, 2024. We have long-term exhibitor service agreements ESAs (approximately 14.4 weighted average years remaining) and multi-year agreements with our network affiliates, which expire at various dates between January 2025 and July 2033. The weighted average remaining term of the ESAs and the network affiliate agreements is 11.5 years as of September 26, 2024. The ESAs and network affiliate agreements grant NCM LLC exclusive rights in their theaters to sell advertising, subject to limited exceptions. Our Noovie Show and LEN programming are distributed predominantly via satellite through our proprietary digital content network DCN ). 
 Management focuses on several measurements that we believe provide us with the necessary ratios and key performance indicators to manage our business, determine how we are performing versus our internal goals and targets, and against the performance of our competitors and other benchmarks in the marketplace in which we operate. We focus on many operating metrics including changes in revenue, Adjusted OIBDA and Adjusted OIBDA margin, as some of our primary measurement metrics. In addition, we monitor our monthly advertising performance measurements, including advertising inventory utilization, advertising pricing CPM ), local advertising rate per theater per week, advertising revenue per attendee, as well as significant operating expenses and related trends. We also monitor free cash flow, cash balances, the fixed charge coverage ratio and revolving credit facility availability to ensure financial debt covenant compliance and that there is adequate cash availability to fund our working capital needs, debt obligations and any future dividends declared by our Board of Directors. 
 Our operating results may be affected by a variety of internal and external factors and trends described more fully in the section entitled Risk Factors below and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on March 18, 2024 for our fiscal year ended December 28, 2023.

 National advertising revenue decreased by 5.2 million, or 10.0 , from 52.0 million for the third quarter of 2023 to 46.8 million for the third quarter of 2024. The decrease in national advertising revenue was primarily due to a 7.7 decrease in attendance due to a decreased movie slate in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023, caused by the writer and actor strikes in 2023 and a 4.5 decrease in CPMs in the third quarter of 2024, as compared to the third quarter of 2023. 
 Local and regional advertising revenue decreased by 1.5 million, or 11.6 , from 12.9 million for the third quarter of 2023 to 11.4 million for the third quarter of 2024. The decrease in local and regional advertising revenue was primarily due to a decrease in contract activity and size within the government, consumer packaged goods, entertainment, and education categories partially driven by a decreased movie slate in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023 due to the writer and actor strikes in 2023. The decrease was partially offset by an increase in contract activity and size within the automotive, healthcare, wireless and insurance categories, in the third quarter of 2024, as compared to the third quarter of 2023, as well as by the launch of the new programmatic offering in early 2024. 
 ESA Party beverage revenue decreased 0.5 million, or 10.6 from 4.7 million for the third quarter of 2023 to 4.2 million for the third quarter of 2024. The decrease was primarily due to a 4.4 decrease in ESA Party attendance for the third quarter of 2024, as compared to the third quarter of 2023. 
 Network operating costs. Network operating costs decreased 0.4 million, or 10.8 , from 3.7 million for the third quarter of 2023 to 3.3 million for the third quarter of 2024. The decrease was primarily due to a 0.2 million decrease in costs associated with our digital out of home offering due to a decrease in associated revenue and a 0.2 million decrease in personnel related expenses in the third quarter of 2024, as compared to the third quarter of 2023. These decreases were partially offset by a 0.1 million increase in satellite costs related to the one-time transition of providers in the third quarter of 2024, as compared to the third quarter of 2023. 
 ESA Parties and network affiliate fees. ESA Parties and network affiliate fees decreased by 1.9 million, or 5.5 , from 34.8 million for the third quarter of 2023 to 32.9 million for the third quarter of 2024. The decrease was primarily due to a 7.7 decrease in network attendance, as well as the rejection of certain affiliate agreements through the bankruptcy proceedings in 2023. These decreases were partially offset by contractual rate increases with the ESA parties for the third quarter of 2024, as compared to the third quarter of 2023. 
 Selling and marketing costs. Selling and marketing costs decreased 1.7 million, or 14.4 , from 11.8 million for the third quarter of 2023 to 10.1 million for the third quarter of 2024. The decrease was primarily due to a 1.9 million decrease in personnel related expenses primarily related to performance-based compensation due in part to the decrease in revenue, as well as, changes in the Company's incentive compensation plan following the workforce reorganization in the first quarter of 2024 and a 0.8 million decrease in costs associated with our digital offerings due to a decrease in digital revenue in the third quarter of 2024, as compared to the third quarter of 2023. These decreases were partially offset by a 0.6 million increase in selling

 related expenses and a 0.4 million increase in bad debt expense in the third quarter of 2024, as compared to the third quarter of 2023. 
 Administrative and other costs. Administrative and other costs decreased 13.1 million, or 50.4 , from 26.0 million for the third quarter of 2023 to 12.9 million for the third quarter of 2024. The decrease was primarily related to a 12.9 million decrease in legal and professional fees related to the Chapter 11 Case and Cineworld Proceeding incurred in the third quarter of 2023 compared the third quarter of 2024. Additionally, the decrease was due to a 1.9 million decrease in personnel related costs due to the workforce reorganization in the first quarter of 2024 and a retention program implemented to ensure continuity of the management team during the Chapter 11 Case in place during the third quarter of 2023. These decreases were partially offset by a 1.5 million increase in stock based compensation following the grant of a management equity incentive plan in the first quarter of 2024 compared to limited grant activity in 2023. 
 Loss on termination of Regal ESA. Loss on termination of Regal ESA decreased 125.6 million, or 100.0 , from 125.6 million for the third quarter of 2023 to 0.0 million for the third quarter of 2024. This was primarily due to a 141.5 million disposal of the intangible asset related to the Regal ESA in the third quarter of 2023, offset by the 13.0 million gain on Regal's surrender of ownership in the Company, and 2.9 million in payables forgiven in conjunction with emergence from bankruptcy in the third quarter of 2023. 
 Impairment of long-lived assets. Impairment of long-lived assets decreased 9.6 million, or 100.0 , from 9.6 million for the third quarter of 2023 to 0.0 million for the third quarter of 2024. This was primarily due to the write-off of certain long-lived intangible assets in the third quarter of 2023. 
 Depreciation expense. Depreciation expense increased 0.2 million, or 20.0 , from 1.0 million for the third quarter of 2023 to 1.2 million in the third quarter of 2024. This decrease was primarily due to the fair value adjustments to NCM LLC's property and equipment upon reconsolidation by NCM, Inc. on August 7, 2023, as well as, accelerated depreciation recognized on leasehold improvements in conjunction with the relocation of one office location. 
 Amortization expense. Amortization expense increased 1.7 million, or 21.8 , from 7.8 million for the third quarter of 2023 to 9.5 million for the third quarter of 2024. The increase was primarily due to the fair value adjustments to NCM LLC's intangible assets upon reconsolidation by NCM, Inc. on August 7, 2023.

The increase in national advertising revenue was primarily due to the deconsolidation and reconsolidation of NCM LLC within the nine months ended September 28, 2023.

 quarter of 2024 compared to limited grant activity in 2023, a 1.5 million increase in other corporate expenses due to the deconsolidation of NCM LLC during a portion of the nine months ended September 28, 2023 while NCM LLC's Chapter 11 Case was ongoing and a 1.2 million increase in severance expense due to the non-renewal of the former President - Sales, Marketing and Partnerships' contract for the nine months ended September 26, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 28, 2023.

The decrease in national advertising revenue was primarily due to a 18.6 decrease in attendance due to a decreased movie slate in the nine months ended September 26, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 28, 2023, caused by the writer and actor strikes in 2023.

The decrease was primarily due to the 18.6 decrease in network attendance, as well as the rejection of certain affiliate agreements through the bankruptcy proceedings in 2023. These decreases were partially offset by the increase in fees owed under the Regal Advertising Agreement, which commenced on July 14, 2023, as well as due to contractual rate increases with the ESAs for the nine months ended September 28, 2023, as compared to the nine months ended September 26, 2024.

Administrative and other costs decreased 41.1 million, or 50.8 , from 80.9 million for the nine months ended September 28, 2023 to 39.8 million for the nine months ended September 26, 2024. The decrease was primarily related to a 42.9 million decrease in legal and professional fees related to the Chapter 11 Case and Cineworld Proceeding incurred in the nine months ended September 28, 2023 compared to the nine months ended September 26, 2024. Additionally, the decrease was due to a 2.4 million decrease in personnel related costs due to the workforce reorganization in the first quarter of 2024 and a retention program implemented to ensure continuity of the management team during the Chapter 11 Case in place during the third quarter of 2023 and a 0.4 million decrease in lease related expenses for the nine months ended September 26, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 28, 2023. These decreases were partially offset by a 4.1 million increase in share-based compensation following the grant of a management equity incentive plan in the first quarter of 2024 compared to limited grant activity in 2023 as well as a 0.4 million increase in cloud computing costs in the third quarter of 2024, compared to the third quarter of 2023. 
 Loss on termination of Regal ESA. Loss on termination of Regal ESA decreased 125.6 million, or 100.0 , from 125.6 million for the third quarter of 2023 to 0.0 million for the third quarter of 2024. This was primarily due to a 141.5 million disposal of the intangible asset related to the Regal ESA in the third quarter of 2023, offset by 13.0 million gain on Regal's surrender of ownership in the Company and 2.9 million in payables forgiven in conjunction with emergence from bankruptcy in the third quarter of 2023. 
 Impairment of long-lived assets. Impairment of long-lived assets decreased 9.6 million, or 100.0 , from 9.6 million for the third quarter of 2023 to 0.0 million for the third quarter of 2024. This was primarily due to the write-off of certain long-lived intangible assets in the third quarter of 2023. 
 Depreciation expense. Depreciation expense decreased 0.2 million, or 5.6 , from 3.6 million for the nine months ended September 28, 2023 to 3.4 million for the nine months ended September 26, 2024. This decrease was primarily due to the fair value adjustments to NCM LLC's property and equipment upon reconsolidation with NCM, Inc. on August 7, 2023. 
 Amortization expense. Amortization expense increased 8.1 million, or 39.9 , from 20.3 million for the nine months ended September 28, 2023 to 28.4 million for the nine months ended September 26, 2024. The increase was primarily due to the fair value adjustments to NCM LLC's intangible assets upon reconsolidation with NCM, Inc. on August 7, 2023. 
 Non-GAAP Financial Measures for NCM LLC 
 Adjusted OIBDA and Adjusted OIBDA margin are not financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP in the United States. Adjusted OIBDA represents operating income before depreciation and amortization expense adjusted to also exclude non-cash share-based compensation costs, impairment of long-lived assets, workforce reorganization costs, loss on termination of Regal ESA, satellite transition costs, system optimization costs and fees and expenses related to involvement in the Cineworld Proceeding and Chapter 11 Case. Adjusted OIBDA margin is calculated by dividing Adjusted OIBDA by total revenue. Our management uses these non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate operating performance, to forecast future results and as a basis for compensation. The Company believes these are important supplemental measures of operating performance because they eliminate items that have less bearing on its operating performance and highlight trends in its core business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on GAAP financial measures. The Company believes the presentation of these measures is relevant and useful for investors because it enables them to view performance in a manner similar to the method used by the Company s management, helps improve their ability to understand the Company s operating performance and makes it easier to compare the Company s results with other companies that may have different depreciation and amortization policies, non-cash share-based compensation programs, impairment of long-lived assets, workforce reorganization costs, loss on termination of Regal ESA, satellite transition costs, system optimization costs and fees and expenses related to involvement in the Cineworld Proceeding and Chapter 11 Case, interest rates, debt levels or income tax rates. A limitation of these measures, however, is that they exclude depreciation and amortization, which represent a proxy for the periodic costs of certain capitalized tangible and intangible assets used in generating revenues in NCM LLC s business. In addition, Adjusted OIBDA has the limitation of not reflecting the effect of the Company s depreciation, amortization, share-based compensation costs, impairment of long-lived assets, workforce reorganization costs, loss on termination of Regal ESA, satellite transition costs, system optimization costs and fees and expenses related to involvement in the Cineworld Proceeding or Chapter 11 Case. Adjusted OIBDA should not be regarded as an alternative to operating income, net income or as indicators of operating performance, nor should it be considered in isolation of, or as substitutes for financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. The Company believes that operating income is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure to Adjusted OIBDA. Because not all companies use 
 31

 identical calculations, these non-GAAP presentations may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies, or calculations in NCM LLC s debt agreement.

Known Trends and Uncertainties 
 Beverage Revenue Under the ESAs, up to 90 seconds of The Noovie Show program can be sold to the ESA Parties to satisfy their on-screen advertising commitments under their beverage concessionaire agreements. In 2023, Cinemark and Regal, prior to the termination of Regal's ESA, purchased 60 seconds of on-screen advertising time and AMC purchased 30 seconds to satisfy their obligations under their beverage concessionaire agreements. In the first nine months of 2024, Cinemark purchased 60 seconds of on-screen advertising time and AMC purchased 30 seconds to satisfy their obligations under their beverage concessionaire agreements. The ESA Parties current long-term contracts with their beverage suppliers require the 30 or 60 seconds of beverage advertising, although such commitments could change in the future. Per the ESA with AMC, the time sold to the beverage supplier is priced equal to the greater of (1) the advertising CPM charged by NCM LLC in the previous year for the time sold to the beverage supplier and (2) the advertising CPM for the previous year charged by NCM LLC to unaffiliated third parties during segment one (closest to showtime) of The Noovie Show in the ESA Parties theaters, limited to the highest advertising CPM being then-charged by NCM LLC. Beginning in 2020 and in accordance with the 2019 ESA Amendment, the price for the time sold to Cinemark's beverage supplier and Regal s beverage suppliers, prior to the termination of Regal's ESA, now increases at a fixed rate of 2.0 each year. From and after July 14, 2023, the effective date of the Regal Advertising Agreement, the Company no longer receives ESA beverage revenue from Regal. 
 ESA Parties and network affiliate fees In consideration for NCM LLC s access to the ESA Parties and network affiliate theaters for on-screen and LEN advertising and lobby promotions, the ESA Parties and network affiliates receive access fees based either upon number of attendees, a revenue share or a combination, including a minimum revenue guarantee per attendee. Many of these agreements contain annual increases to the respective fee structures or guaranteed minimums, either per patron, per theater and/or per digital screen. The payments under the ESA Parties' agreements and network affiliate agreements are recorded within ESA

 Financial Condition and Liquidity 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Our cash balances can fluctuate due to the seasonality of our business and related timing of collections of accounts receivable balances and operating expenditure payments, as well as interest or principal payments on our Revolving Credit Facility 2023 (as defined below), income tax payments, TRA payments, available cash payments (as defined in the NCM LLC Operating Agreement) to Cinemark and AMC in the event the ESA Parties hold NCM LLC membership units and amount of dividends to NCM, Inc. s common stockholders. 
 On August 7, 2023, NCM LLC entered into a Loan, Security and Guarantee Agreement (the Revolving Credit Facility 2023 with CIT Northbridge Credit LLC as agent. The Revolving Credit Facility 2023 is an asset backed line facility where the capacity depends upon NCM LLC s trade accounts receivable balance, as adjusted for aged balances and other considerations. The maximum availability NCM LLC has access to under the revolver is 55.0 million. The proceeds of the Revolving Credit Facility 2023 may be used for, inter alia, working capital and capital expenditures. The Revolving Credit Facility 2023 will mature on August 7, 2026. The interest rate under the Revolving Credit Facility 2023 is a base rate or SOFR benchmark plus (i) 3.75 if less than 50 of revolving commitments are utilized or (ii) 4.50 if 50 or more of revolving commitments are utilized (utilizing the average revolver usage for the prior calendar month as a benchmark for this determination). The Revolving Credit Facility 2023 also contains a financial maintenance covenant requiring that the fixed charge coverage ratio ending on the last day of each fiscal month is at least 1.1 to 1.0 during a Trigger Period. A Trigger Period begins upon (i) an event of default or (ii) if availability is less than the greater of (a) 5.0 million and (b) 10 of aggregate revolving commitments. A Trigger Period ends only if (i) no event of default existed for the preceding 30 consecutive days and (ii) availability is greater than both (a) 5.0 million and (b) 10 of aggregate revolving commitments. Upon the effectiveness of the Revolving Credit Facility 2023, NCM LLC immediately drew 10.0 million from the facility, which represents the only amounts currently outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility 2023 as of September 26, 2024. 
 A summary of our financial liquidity is as follows (in millions):

(2) The Revolving Credit Facility 2023 portion of NCM LLC s total borrowings that is available, subject to certain conditions, for general corporate purposes of NCM LLC in the ordinary course of business and for other transactions permitted under the senior secured credit facility, and a portion is available for letters of credit. NCM LLC s total capacity under the Revolving Credit Facility 2023, which subject to fluctuations in the underlying assets, is 55.0 million as of September 26, 2024. As of September 26, 2024, the amount available under the NCM LLC Revolving Credit Facility 2023 in the table above is net of the amount outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility 2023 of 10.0 million, and net letters of credit of 0.6 million. 

As of September 26, 2024, the weighted average remaining maturity of our debt was 1.9 years. As of September 26, 2024, 100.0 of our borrowings bear interest at variable rates and our net income and earnings per share could fluctuate with market interest rate fluctuations that could increase or decrease the interest paid on our borrowings.

Operating Activitie s. The 52.1 million increase in cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 26, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 28, 2023, was due to 1) a 58.0 million decrease in net loss adjusted for non-cash items, 2) an 11.3 million decrease in the change in prepaid expenses, 3) a 10.6 million increase in deferred revenue, 5) a 7.1 million decrease in the change in amounts due from to ESA Parties, net, 6) a 1.6 million decrease in payments of accounts payable and accrued expenses and 7) a 0.6 million decrease in cash used by 

33 

NATIONAL CINEMEDIA, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) 

 other operating activities for the nine months ended September 26, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 28, 2023. These increases in cash provided by operating activities were partially offset by 1) a 30.5 million decrease in account receivable collections, 2) a 3.8 million decrease in integration and other encumbered theaters payments received and 3) a 2.8 million change in other operating assets and liabilities for the nine months ended September 26, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 28, 2023. 

Investing Activities. The 36.5 million increase in cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 26, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 28, 2023, was primarily due to the 49.5 million addition of cash and cash equivalents due to the reconsolidation of NCM LLC in the third quarter of 2023 with no similar activity in 2024. Additionally, there was a 1.7 million increase in purchases of property and equipment in connection with the commencement of new leases and a 1.0 million decrease in proceeds from sale and maturities of marketable securities for the nine months ended September 26, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 28, 2023. These increases in cash used by investing activities were partially offset by a 15.5 million cash contribution made in conjunction with the reconsolidation of NCM LLC during the third quarter of 2023 and a 0.6 million increase in proceeds received from an equity method investment for the nine months ended September 26, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 28, 2023. 

Financing Activities. The 40.0 million decrease in cash used in financing activities for the nine months ended September 26, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 28, 2023, was primarily due to the removal of 49.6 million of cash caused by the deconsolidation of NCM LLC in the second quarter of 2023. Additionally, there was a 1.2 million decrease in payments of debt issuance costs and a 0.8 million decrease in repayments of the term loan facility due to an amendment to the Credit Agreement 2018 and Revolving Credit Agreement 2022 in the nine months ended September 28, 2023, as compared to the nine months ended September 26, 2024. These decreases were partially offset by a 11.1 million increase in payments made to repurchase shares of NCM, Inc.'s common stock and 0.7 million increase in cash redemptions of NCM LLC common membership units during the nine months ended September 26, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 28, 2023. 

Sources of Capital and Capital Requirements 
 NCM, Inc. s primary source of liquidity and capital resources is the quarterly available cash distributions from NCM LLC as well as its existing cash balances and marketable securities, which as of September 26, 2024 were 49.5 million (including 45.5 million of cash and restricted cash held by NCM LLC). NCM LLC s primary sources of liquidity and capital resources are its cash provided by operating activities, availability under its Revolving Credit Facility 2023 and cash on hand. NCM LLC drew down 10.0 million of its Revolving Credit Facility 2023 immediately upon emergence from bankruptcy on August 7, 2023. The 45.5 million of cash at NCM LLC will be used to fund operations. Cash at NCM, Inc. is used to fund income taxes, payments associated with the TRA, stock repurchases and for future payment of dividends to NCM, Inc. stockholders if and when declared by the Board of Directors. 
 Cash flows generated by NCM LLC s distributions to NCM, Inc. and NCM LLC s other members were deferred during the Chapter 11 Case. NCM LLC is required, pursuant to the terms of the NCM LLC Operating Agreement, to distribute its available cash, as defined in the NCM LLC Operating Agreement, quarterly to its members. The other members are only able to receive available cash when they hold units. The available cash amount to the members of NCM LLC for the three months ended September 26, 2024 was calculated as approximately 4.7 million, due almost entirely to NCM, Inc., as the primary holder of NCM LLC units as of September 26, 2024. NCM, Inc. has the option to defer payment of any available cash distributions payable to NCM, Inc. at its discretion. As of September 26, 2024, NCM LLC owed NCM, Inc. 4.7 million in deferred available cash distribution. 
 NCM, Inc. expects to use its cash balances and cash received from future available cash distributions (as allowed for under the Revolving Credit Facility 2023) to fund payments associated with the TRA, stock repurchases and future dividends if and when declared by the Board of Directors. The Company does not expect to make a TRA payment in 2024 for the 2023 tax year and did not make a TRA payment in 2023 for the 2022 tax year. The Company expects to make a TRA payment in 2025 for the 2024 tax year. Deferred distributions from NCM LLC and NCM, Inc. cash balances should be sufficient to fund payments associated with the TRA, income taxes and any stock repurchases or declared dividends for the foreseeable future at the discretion of the Board of Directors. At the discretion of the Board of Directors, the Company will consider returning a portion of its free cash flow to stockholders. The declaration, payment, timing and amount of any future stock repurchases or dividends payable will be at the sole discretion of the Board of Directors who will take into account general economic and advertising market business conditions, the Company s financial condition, available cash, current and anticipated cash needs and any other factors that the Board of Directors considers relevant. 
 Critical Accounting Policies

 Consolidated Financial Statements, see Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Critical Accounting Estimates contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed for the fiscal year ended December 28, 2023 and incorporated by reference herein. As of September 26, 2024, there were no other significant changes in those critical accounting policies. 
 Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
 For a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements, see the information provided under Note 1 The Company to the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q. 
 The Company has considered all other recently issued accounting pronouncements and does not believe the adoption of such pronouncements will have a material impact on its unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 Not required for smaller reporting companies. 
 Item 4. Cont rols and Procedures 
 The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the Company's reports filed under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer (principal executive officer) and Chief Financial Officer (principal financial and accounting officer), as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 Management, with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, performed an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act as of September 26, 2024, the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based on such evaluation, the Company s management concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures as of September 26, 2024 were effective. 
 In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any control, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. Due to the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 There were no changes to our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended September 26, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 PART II OTHER INFORMA TION 
 Item 1. Legal Proce edings 
 On June 26, 2023, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order authorizing NCM LLC s entry into the Regal Advertising Agreement and the Regal Termination Agreement (the Regal Order ). On June 27, 2023, the Bankruptcy Court entered the Confirmation Order approving the Disclosure Statement on a final basis and confirming the Company s Plan. On August 7, 2023, the conditions precedent to the Plan were satisfied and NCM LLC emerged from bankruptcy. On June 29, 2023, AMC and Cinemark filed a notice of appeal of the Confirmation Order, and a week later appealed the Regal Order. Subsequently, AMC and Cinemark sought a stay of the Confirmation Order and Regal Order in the Bankruptcy Court, the District Court for the Southern District of Texas, and the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, all of which denied the request. Following AMC and Cinemark s consolidated appeal on the merits, the District Court for the Southern District of Texas confirmed the Confirmation Order and the Regal Order on August 13, 2024. The consolidated appeals of the District Court s decision on the merits are pending in the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. 
 We are sometimes involved in legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. We are not aware of any other litigation currently pending that would have a material adverse effect on our operating results or financial condition. 
 Item 1A. Risk Fa ctors 
 There have been no material changes from risk factors as previously disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on March 18, 2024 for the fiscal year ended December 28, 2023.

AMENDED AND RESTATED EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT

Executive also acknowledges that the Company s relationships with its business partners hereinafter Business Partners which means NCM LLC, AMC, Cinemark and Regal and all their respective Affiliates together with any chain, circuit or group (of any nature of description) of movie theaters or like venues which now or hereafter enter into business relations with the Company), are extremely valuable and that, by virtue of Executive s employment with the Company, he may have contact with such Business Partners on behalf of and for the benefit of the Company. As a result, Executive s engaging in or working for or with any business which is directly or indirectly competitive with the Company s business, given Executive s knowledge of the Company s Proprietary or Confidential Information, would cause the Company great and irreparable harm if not done in strict compliance with the provisions of this Section 6 . Therefore, Executive acknowledges and agrees that in consideration of all of the above and in exchange for access to the Company s Proprietary or Confidential Information, Executive will be bound by, and comply in all respects with, the provisions of this Section 6 . For purposes of this Section 6 , any references to the time period of Executive s employment with the Company shall date back to Executive s original hire date with the Company.

identifiable information regarding Company employees, contractors, and applicants; lists of actual or potential Business Partners; and all other business plans, trade secrets, or financial information of strategic importance to the Company or its Affiliates) that is not generally known in the Company s industry, that was learned, discovered, developed, conceived, originated, or prepared during Executive s employment with the Company, and the competitive use or disclosure of which would be harmful to the business prospects, financial status, or reputation of the Company or its Affiliates at the time of any disclosure by Executive. 

The relationship between Executive and the Company and its Affiliates is and shall continue to be one in which the Company and its Affiliates repose special trust and confidence in Executive, and one in which Executive has and shall have a fiduciary relationship to the Company and its Affiliates. As a result, the Company and its Affiliates shall, in the course of Executive s duties to the Company, entrust Executive with, and disclose to Executive, Proprietary or Confidential Information. Executive recognizes that Proprietary or Confidential Information has been developed or acquired, or will be developed or acquired, by the Company and its Affiliates at great expense, is proprietary to the Company and its Affiliates, and is and shall remain the property of the Company and its Affiliates.

Executive acknowledges that any use of Proprietary or Confidential Information by persons not in the employ of the Company and its Affiliates would provide such persons with an unfair competitive advantage which they would not have without the knowledge and/or use of the Proprietary or Confidential Information and that this would cause the Company and its Affiliates irreparable harm. Executive further acknowledges that because of this unfair competitive advantage, and the Company s and its Affiliates legitimate business interests, which include their need to protect their goodwill and the Proprietary or Confidential Information, Executive has agreed to the post-employment restrictions set forth in this Section 6 .

(c) Non-Competition . 

i. In return for, among other things, all of the above and the Company s promise to provide the Proprietary or Confidential Information described herein, Executive agrees that during Executive s employment and the Coverage Period, Executive shall not compete with the Company by providing work, services or any other form of assistance (whether or not for compensation) in any capacity, whether as an employee, consultant, partner, or otherwise, to any Competitor that (1) is the same or similar to the services Executive provided to the Company or (2) creates the reasonable risk that Executive will (willfully, inadvertently or inevitably) use or disclose the Company s Proprietary or Confidential Information. Competitor includes any business that operates or does business similar in nature to that of the Company during the Employment Period in any State, territory, or protectorate of the United States in which the Company or an Affiliate does business and/or in any foreign country in which the Company or an Affiliate has or maintains any place of business, venue, facility, or otherwise conducts business, as of the date of Executive s termination of employment with the Company. Executive further acknowledges and agrees that the restrictions imposed in this subparagraph (i) will not prevent Executive from earning a livelihood and that they are reasonable. 

ii. Notwithstanding the foregoing, should Executive consider working for or with any actually, arguably, or potentially competing business following the termination of Executive s employment with the Company or any of its Affiliates and during the Coverage Period, then Executive agrees 

8 

to provide the Company with two (2) weeks advance written notice of Executive s intent to do so, and also to provide the Company with accurate information concerning the nature of Executive s anticipated job responsibilities in sufficient detail to allow the Company to meaningfully exercise its rights under this Section 6 . After receipt of such notice, the Company may then agree, in its sole, absolute, and unreviewable discretion, to waive, modify, or condition its rights under this Section 6 . In particular, the Company may agree to modify Section 6(c)i if the Company concludes that the work Executive will be performing for a Competitor is different from the work Executive was performing during Executive s employment with the Company or any of its Affiliates and/or (2) there is no reasonable risk that Executive will (willfully, inadvertently or inevitably) use or disclose the Company s Proprietary or Confidential Information. 

(d) Non-Solicitation of Business Partners . Executive acknowledges that, by virtue of his employment by the Company or its Affiliates, Executive has gained or will gain knowledge of the identity, characteristics, and preferences of the Company s Business Partners, among other Proprietary or Confidential Information, and that Executive would inevitably have to draw on such information if he were to solicit or service the Company s Business Partners on behalf of a Competitor. Accordingly, during the Employment Period and the Coverage Period, Executive agrees not to, directly or indirectly, solicit the business of or perform any services of the type he performed or sell any products of the type he sold during his employment with the Company for or to actual or prospective Business Partners of the Company (i) as to which Executive performed services, sold products or as to which employees or persons under Executive s supervision or authority performed such services, or had direct contact, or (ii) as to which Executive had accessed Proprietary or Confidential Information during the course of Executive s employment by the Company, or in any manner encourage or induce any such actual or prospective Business Partner to cease doing business with or in any way interfere with the relationship between the Company and its Affiliates and such actual or prospective Business Partner. Executive further agrees that during the Employment Period and the Coverage Period, Executive will not encourage or assist any Competitor to solicit or service any actual or prospective Business Partners or otherwise seek to encourage or induce any Business Partners to cease doing business with, or reduce the extent of its business dealings with the Company. 

(e) Non-Interference . During Executive s Employment Period and the Coverage Period, Executive agrees that Executive shall not, directly or indirectly, induce or encourage any Business Partner or other third party, including any provider of goods or services to the Company, to terminate or diminish its business relationship with the Company; nor will Executive take any other action that could, directly or indirectly, be detrimental to the Company s relationships with its Business Partners and providers of goods or services or other business affiliates or that could otherwise interfere with the Company s business. 

(f) Non-Disparagement . Executive agrees during and following the Employment Period, not to make, or cause to be made, any statement, observation, or opinion, or communicate any information (whether oral or written, directly or indirectly) that (i) accuses or implies that the other Party or its Affiliates, as may be applicable, engaged in any wrongful, unlawful or improper conduct, whether relating to Executive s employment (or the termination thereof), the business, management, or operations of the Company or its Affiliates, as may be applicable, or otherwise, or (ii) disparages, impugns, or in any way reflects adversely upon the business or reputation of the other Party or its subsidiaries or affiliates, as may be applicable. Nothing herein will be deemed to preclude either Party from providing truthful testimony or information pursuant to subpoena, court order, or similar legal process, instituting and pursuing legal action, or engaging in other legally protected speech or activities or to prevent either Party from making any disclosure required by the Exchange Act or other applicable law (including, without limitation, a Company disclosure deemed advisable under the federal securities laws or the rules of any stock exchange). 

(g) Breach . Executive acknowledges that the restrictions contained in this Section 6 are fair, reasonable, and necessary for the protection of the legitimate business interests of the Company, that the Company will suffer irreparable harm in the event of any actual or threatened breach by Executive, and that it is difficult to measure in money the damages which will accrue to the Company by reason of a failure by Executive to perform any of Executive s obligations under this Section 6 . Accordingly, if the Company or any of its subsidiaries or Affiliates institutes any action or proceeding to enforce their rights under this Section 6 , to the extent permitted by applicable law, Executive hereby waives the claim or defense that the Company or its Affiliates has an adequate remedy at law, Executive shall not claim that any such remedy at law exists, and Executive consents to the entry of a restraining order, preliminary injunction, or other preliminary, provisional, or permanent court order to enforce this Agreement, and expressly waives any security that might otherwise be required in connection with such relief. Executive also 

9 

agrees that any request for such relief by the Company shall be in addition and without prejudice to any claim for monetary damages and/or other relief which the Company might elect to assert. The Parties further agree that, in the event that any provision of Section 6 shall be determined by any court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable by reason of its being extended over too great a time, too large a geographic area or too great a range of activities, such provision shall be deemed to be modified to permit its enforcement to the maximum extent permitted by law. The length of time for which the covenants in Section 6 shall be in force shall be extended by an amount of time equal to the period of time during which a violation of such covenant is deemed by a court of competent jurisdiction to have occurred (including any period required for litigation during which the Company seeks to enforce such covenant). If, notwithstanding such provision, a court in any judicial proceeding refuses to enforce any of the separate covenants included herein, the unenforceable covenant will be considered eliminated from these provisions for the purpose of those proceedings to the extent necessary to permit the remaining separate covenants to be enforced. 

(h) Notice . Notwithstanding Executive s confidentiality and nondisclosure obligations, Executive is hereby advised as follows pursuant to the Defend Trade Secrets Act: An individual shall not be held criminally or civilly liable under any Federal or State trade secret law for the disclosure of a trade secret that: (A) is made (i) in confidence to a federal, state, or local government official, either directly or indirectly, or to an attorney and (ii) solely for the purpose of reporting or investigating a suspected violation of law; or (B) is made in a complaint or other document filed in a lawsuit or other proceeding, if such filing is made under seal. An individual who files a lawsuit for retaliation by an employer for reporting a suspected violation of law may disclose the trade secret to the attorney of the individual and use the trade secret information in the court proceeding, if the individual: (A) files any document containing the trade secret under seal; and (B) does not disclose the trade secret, except pursuant to court order. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Agreement is intended to, nor shall be construed to, conflict with the Defend Trade Secrets Act 18 U.S.C. 1833(b). Further, Executive understands that nothing in this Agreement or any other agreement that Executive may have with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries restricts or prohibits Executive from communicating with government agencies about possible violations of federal, state, or local laws or otherwise providing information to government agencies filing a complaint with government agencies, or participating in government agency investigations or proceedings, or from making other disclosures that are protected under the whistleblower provisions of state or federal law or regulation, and Executive does not need the Company s prior authorization to engage in such conduct. 

(i) Attorneys Fees . In the event of any action or proceeding arising out of, to compel compliance with, or for a breach of any of the terms and conditions of this Section 6, the prevailing Party shall be entitled to recover from the non-prevailing Party all costs of such action or proceeding, including all attorneys fees, costs and disbursements . 

7. Survival . Sections 6 , 7 through 15 , 18 and 19 , and such other provisions hereof as may so indicate shall survive and continue in full force and effect in accordance with their respective terms, notwithstanding any termination of the Employment Period. 

8. Notices . Any notice provided for in this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be delivered (i) personally, (ii) by certified mail, postage prepaid, (iii) by UPS, Federal Express or other reputable courier service regularly providing evidence of delivery (with charges paid by the party sending the notice), or (iv) by facsimile or a PDF or similar attachment to an email, provided that such telecopy or email attachment shall be followed within one (1) business day by delivery of such notice pursuant to clause (i), (ii) or (iii) above. Any such notice to a party shall be addressed at the address set forth below (subject to the right of a party to designate a different address for itself by notice similarly given):

10. No Conflict . Executive represents and warrants that Executive is not bound by any employment contract, restrictive covenant, or other restriction preventing Executive from carrying out Executive s responsibilities for the Employer, or which is in any way inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement. Executive further represents and warrants that Executive shall not disclose to the Employer or induce the Employer to use any confidential or proprietary information or material belonging to any previous employer or others. 

11. Successors and Assigns . This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by Executive and his heirs, executors and personal representatives, and the Company and its successors and assigns. Any successor or assignee of the Company shall assume the liabilities of the Company hereunder, and for the avoidance of doubt, no such assignment shall be treated as a termination of Executive s employment with the assignor for purposes of this Agreement. 

12. Governing Law; Alternative Dispute Resolution . Executive acknowledges, understands, and agrees, following consultation with and representation by counsel of his own choosing, that this Agreement shall be governed by the internal laws (as opposed to the conflicts of law provisions) of the State of Colorado. Executive acknowledges, understands, and agrees, following consultation with and representation by counsel of his own choosing, that any and all disputes, claims or controversies arising out of or relating to this Agreement or Executive s employment with the Company or termination thereof, other than with respect to disputes arising out of Section 6 herein Non-Arbitrable Disputes ), shall be submitted to arbitration in accordance with and under the auspices of the Employment Arbitration Rules of JAMS (Denver Colorado office) or its successor, with the arbitration to take place in Denver, Colorado, unless the Parties mutually agree to conduct the arbitration in a different location. The arbitrator shall be selected by the mutual agreement of the Parties. The arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of this Agreement, including but not limited to any claim that all or any part of this Agreement is void or voidable. The arbitrator shall apply the applicable statute of limitations to any claim. The arbitrator shall issue a written opinion and award, which shall be signed and dated. The arbitrator shall be permitted to award those remedies that are available under applicable law. The arbitrator s decision regarding the claims shall be final and binding upon the Parties.

Executive acknowledges, understands, and agrees, following consultation with and representation by counsel of his own choosing, that Non-Arbitrable Disputes shall be commenced only in a state or federal court in Colorado, and the Company and Executive each submits to the personal jurisdiction of such courts. The Company and Executive each hereby irrevocably waives any right to a trial by jury in any action, suit or other legal proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or Executive s employment with the Company or termination thereof. 

13. Amendment and Waiver . The provisions of this Agreement may be amended or waived only with the prior written consent of the Company and Executive, and no course of conduct or failure or delay in enforcing the provisions of this Agreement shall affect the validity, binding effect or enforceability of this Agreement. 

14. Withholding . All payments and benefits under this Agreement are subject to withholding of all applicable taxes. 

15. Code Section 409A . This Agreement is intended to be exempt from, or comply with, the requirements of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended (the Code ), and shall be interpreted and construed consistently with such intent. The payments to Executive pursuant to this Agreement are also intended to be exempt from Section 409A of the Code to the maximum extent possible, under either the separation pay exemption pursuant to Treasury regulation 1.409A-1(b)(9)(iii) or as short-term deferrals pursuant to Treasury regulation 1.409A-1(b)(4). For purposes of Section 409A of the Code, Executive s right to receive any installment payments 

11 

under this Agreement (whether severance payments, reimbursements or otherwise) shall be treated as a right to receive a series of separate payments and, accordingly, each installment payment hereunder shall at all times be considered a separate and distinct payment. In the event the terms of this Agreement would subject Executive to taxes or penalties under Section 409A of the Code 409A Penalties ), the Company and Executive shall cooperate diligently to amend the terms of the Agreement to avoid such 409A Penalties, to the extent possible. To the extent required to avoid the imposition of additional taxes and penalties under Section 409A of the Code, any amounts under this Agreement are payable by reference to Executive s termination of employment such term and similar terms shall be deemed to refer to Executive s separation from service, within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code; provided , however , that a separation from service means a separation from service with the Company and all other persons or entities with whom the Company would be considered a single employer under Section 414(b) or 414(c) of the Code, applying the 80 threshold used in such Code sections and the Treasury Regulations thereunder, all within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code. Executive hereby agrees to be bound by the Company s determination of its specified employees (as such term is defined in Section 409A of the Code) provided such determination is in accordance with any of the methods permitted under the regulations issued under Section 409A of the Code. Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement, to the extent any payments made or contemplated hereunder constitute nonqualified deferred compensation, within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code, then (i) each such payment which is conditioned upon Executive s execution of a release and which is to be paid or provided during a designated period that begins in one taxable year and ends in a second taxable year, shall be paid or provided in the later of the two taxable years and (ii) if Executive is a specified employee (within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code) as of the date of Executive s separation from service, each such payment that constitutes deferred compensation under Section 409A of the Code and is payable upon Executive s separation from service and would have been paid prior to the six-month anniversary of Executive s separation from service, shall be delayed until the earlier to occur of (A) the first day of the seventh month following Executive s separation from service or (B) the date of Executive s death. Any reimbursement payable to Executive pursuant to this Agreement shall be conditioned on the submission by Executive of all expense reports reasonably required by Employer under any applicable expense reimbursement policy, and shall be paid to Executive within 30 days following receipt of such expense reports, but in no event later than the last day of the calendar year following the calendar year in which Executive incurred the reimbursable expense. Any amount of expenses eligible for reimbursement, or in-kind benefit provided, during a calendar year shall not affect the amount of expenses eligible for reimbursement, or in-kind benefit to be provided, during any other calendar year. The right to any reimbursement or in-kind benefit pursuant to this Agreement shall not be subject to liquidation or exchange for any other benefit. In no event will Employer be liable for any additional tax, interest or penalties that may be imposed on Executive under Section 409A of the Code or for any damages for failing to comply with Section 409A of the Code. 

16. Clawbacks . The payments to Executive pursuant to this Agreement are subject to forfeiture or recovery by the Company or other action pursuant to any clawback or recoupment policy which the Company may adopt from time to time, including without limitation any such policy or provision that the Company has included in any of its existing compensation programs or plans or that it may be required to adopt under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and implementing rules and regulations thereunder, or as otherwise required by law. 

17. Company Policies . Executive shall be subject to additional Company policies as they may exist from time-to-time, including policies with regard to stock ownership by senior executives and policies regarding trading of securities. 

18. Indemnification . The Company agrees to indemnify Executive to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law consistent with the Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws of the Company as in effect on the effective date of this Agreement, or as the Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws may be amended from time to time to provide greater indemnification, with respect to any acts or non-acts he may have committed while he was an officer, director and/or employee (i) of the Company or any subsidiary thereof, or (ii) of any other entity if his service with such entity was at the request of the Company. 

19. Executive s Acknowledgements . Executive acknowledges that he: (i) has read this Agreement; (ii) has been represented in the preparation, negotiation, and execution of this Agreement by legal counsel of Executive s own choice; (iii) understands the terms and consequences of this Agreement; and (iv) is fully aware of the legal and binding effect of this Agreement.
