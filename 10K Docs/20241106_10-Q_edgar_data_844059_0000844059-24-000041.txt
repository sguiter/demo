 of its reportable segments in order to clearly define projects within those segments. The Asset Management segment was renamed the Industrial and Commercial segment and the Stabilized Joint Venture segment was renamed the Multifamily Segment. 
 On April 12, 2024, the Company effected a -for-1 forward split of its common stock in the nature of a dividend. All share and per share information, including share-based compensation, throughout this report have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the stock split. The shares of common stock retain a par value of per share. Accordingly, an amount equal to the par value of the increased shares resulting from the stock split was reclassified from capital in excess of par value to common stock.

 reportable segments, Industrial and Commercial (previously named Asset Management), Mining Royalty Lands, Development, and Multifamily (previously named Stabilized Joint Venture), as described below. 
 The Industrial and Commercial Segment owns, leases and manages in-service commercial properties. Currently this includes warehouses in business parks, an office building partially occupied by the Company, and ground leases all wholly owned by the Company. This segment will also include joint ventures of commercial properties when they are stabilized. 
 Our Mining Royalty Lands Segment owns several properties totaling approximately acres currently under lease for mining rents or royalties (this does not include the acres owned in our Brooksville joint venture with Vulcan Materials). Other than one location in Virginia, all of these properties are located in Florida and Georgia. 
 Through our Development Segment, we own and are continuously assessing the highest and best use of several parcels of land that are in various stages of development. Our overall strategy in this segment is to convert all of our non-income producing lands into income production through (i) an orderly process of constructing new buildings for us to own and operate or (ii) a sale to, or joint venture with, third parties. Additionally, our Development segment will form joint ventures on new developments of land not previously owned by the Company. of our joint ventures in the segment, Lakeland Logistics Park Venture, LLC ("Lakeland") and Davie Logistics Park Venture, LLC ("Davie") are consolidated. 
 The Multifamily Segment includes joint ventures which own, lease and manage apartment projects that have met our initial lease-up criteria. of our joint ventures in the segment, Riverfront Investment Partners I, LLC Dock 79 and Riverfront Investment Partners II, LLC The Maren are consolidated. 
 The ownership of our consolidated joint ventures attributable to our partners are reflected on our consolidated balance sheet as a noncontrolling interest. Such noncontrolling interests are reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheets within equity but separately from shareholders' equity. On the Consolidated Statements of Income, all of the revenues and expenses from our consolidated joint ventures are reported in net income, including both the amounts attributable to the Company and the noncontrolling interest. The amounts of consolidated net income attributable to the noncontrolling interest is clearly identified on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income.

 To determine these allocations between FRP and Patriot as set forth in the Administrative Services Agreement, we employ an allocation method to allocate said expenses and thus we believe that the allocations to FRP are a reasonable approximation of the costs related to FRP s operations, but any such related-party transactions cannot be presumed to be carried out on an arm s-length basis.

 Stock Option Plans (the 2006 Stock Incentive Plan and the 2016 Equity Incentive Option Plan) under which stock options, restricted stock, and stock awards were granted to directors, officers and key employees. The 2016 plan permits the grant of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock awards, restricted stock units, or stock awards. The options awarded under the plans have similar characteristics. All stock options are non-qualified and expire from the date of grant. Stock based compensation awarded to directors, officers and employees are exercisable immediately or become exercisable in cumulative installments of or at the end of each year following the date of grant. When stock options are exercised, the Company issues new shares after receipt of exercise proceeds and taxes due, if any, from the grantee. The number of common shares available for future issuance was at September 30, 2024. 
 The Company utilizes the Black-Scholes valuation model for estimating fair value of stock compensation for options awarded to officers and employees. Each grant is evaluated based upon assumptions at the time of grant. The assumptions were dividend yield, expected volatility between and , risk-free interest rate of to and expected life of to years. 
 The dividend yield of is based on the fact that the Company does not pay cash dividends and has no present intention to pay cash dividends. Expected volatility is estimated based on the Company s historical experience over a period equivalent to the expected life in years. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury constant maturity interest rate at the date of grant with a term consistent with the expected life of the options granted. The expected life calculation is based on the observed and expected time to exercise options by the employees.

 The Company and MidAtlantic Realty Partners (MRP) provided a guaranty for the interest carry cost of million loan on the Bryant Street Partnerships issued in December 2023.

The value of the guarantee was calculated at million based on the present value of our assumption of interest savings over the anticipated -month term. This amount is included as part of the Company s investment basis and is amortized to expense over the months. The Company will evaluate the guarantee liability based upon the success of the project and assuming no payments are made under the guarantee, the Company will have a gain for million when the loan is paid in full.

 ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL 
 CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements and related notes in Item 1 and with the audited consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in our annual report on Form 10-K. The statements in this discussion regarding industry outlook, our expectations regarding our future performance, liquidity and capital resources and other non-historical statements in this discussion are forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, including the risks and uncertainties described in Forward-Looking Statements below and Risk Factors on page 5 of our annual report on Form 10-K. Our actual results may differ materially from those contained in or implied by any forward-looking statements. We assume no obligation to revise or publicly release any revision to any forward-looking statements contained in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q, unless required by law. 
 The following discussion includes non-GAAP financial measures within the meaning of Regulation G promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission to supplement the financial results as reported in accordance with GAAP. The non-GAAP financial measures discussed are operating profit before G A and pro rata net operating income (NOI). The Company uses these metrics to analyze its continuing operations and to monitor, assess, and identify meaningful trends in its operating and financial performance. These measures are not, and should not be viewed as, a substitute for GAAP financial measures. Refer to Non-GAAP Financial Measure below in this quarterly report for a more detailed discussion, including reconciliations of this non-GAAP financial measure to its most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.

 Mining royalty lands, some of which will have second lives as development properties; 
 Mixed use properties under development in Washington, D.C., Greenville, SC and Florida; and

Timing of projects may be subject to delays caused by factors beyond our control. 
 
 Reportable Segments

The Company s residential units typically lease for 12 15-month lease terms. 90 days prior to the expiration, as long as there is no balance due, the tenant is offered a renewal. If no notice to move out or renew is made, then the leases go month-to-month until notification of termination or renewal is received. Renewal terms are typically 9 12 months. The Company also leases retail spaces at apartment/mixed-use properties. The retail leases are typically 10 -15-year leases with options to renew for another five years. Retail leases at these properties also include percentage rents which collect on average 3-6 of annual sales when a tenant exceeds a breakpoint stipulated by each individual lease. All base rent revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis. The major cash outlays incurred in this segment are for property taxes, full service maintenance, property management, utilities and marketing. The five multifamily properties are as follows:

 Industrial and Commercial Segment. 
 The Industrial and Commercial segment owns, leases and manages commercial properties. These assets create revenue and cash flows through tenant rental payments, lease management fees and reimbursements for building operating costs. The Company s industrial warehouses typically lease for terms ranging from 3 10 years often with one or two renewal options. All base rent revenue is recognized on a straight-lined basis. All of the commercial warehouse leases are triple net leases. Common area maintenance costs (CAM Revenue) are billed monthly, and insurance and real estate taxes are billed annually. 34 Loveton is the only office product wherein all leases are full service therefore there is no CAM revenue. Office leases are also recognized on a straight-lined basis. The major cash outlays incurred in this segment are for operating expenses, real estate taxes, building repairs, lease commissions and other lease closing costs, construction of tenant improvements, capital to acquire existing operating buildings and closing costs related thereto and personnel costs of our property management team. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Industrial and Commercial Segment includes four commercial properties owned by the Company in fee simple as follows: 
 1) 34 Loveton Circle in suburban Baltimore County, MD consists of one office building totaling 33,708 square feet which is 90.8 occupied (16 of the space is occupied by the Company for use as our Baltimore headquarters). The property is subject to commercial leases with various tenants.

 2) 155 E. 21 st Street in Duval County, FL was an office building property that remains under lease through March 2026. We permitted the tenant to demolish all structures on the property during 2018. 
 3) Cranberry Run Business Park in Harford County, MD consists of five industrial buildings totaling 267,737 square feet which are 92.1 occupied and 92.1 leased. The property is subject to commercial leases with various tenants. 
 4) Hollander 95 Business Park in Baltimore City, MD consists of three industrial buildings totaling 247,340 square feet and two ground leases that are 100.0 leased and 100.0 occupied. 
 Management focuses on and compares several measures of success in this segment (1) net operating income growth, (2) average annual occupancy rate (defined as the occupied square feet at the end of each month during a fiscal year divided by the number of months to date in that fiscal year as a percentage of the average number of square feet in the portfolio over that same time period), and (3) tenant retention success rate (as a percentage of total square feet to be renewed). Among the ways we improve these metrics are focusing on tenant retention and occupancy growth, building and refurbishing assets to meet Class A and Class B institutional grade classifications, and minimizing deferred capital expenditures and asset complexities. 
 Mining Royalty Lands Segment. 
 Our Mining Royalty Lands segment owns several properties totaling approximately 16,650 acres currently under lease for mining rents or royalties (excluding the 4,280 acres owned by our Brooksville joint venture with Vulcan Materials). Other than one location in Virginia, all of these properties are located in Florida and Georgia. The Company leases land under long-term leases that grant the lessee the right to mine and sell sand and stone deposits from our property in exchange for royalty payments. A typical lease has an option to extend the lease for additional terms. The typical lease in this segment requires the tenant to pay us a royalty based on the number of tons of mined materials sold from our property during a given fiscal year multiplied by a percentage of the average annual sales price per ton sold. As a result of this royalty payment structure, we do not bear the cost risks associated with the mining operations, however, we are subject to the cyclical nature of the construction markets in these states as both volumes and prices tend to fluctuate through those cycles. In certain locations, typically where the sand and stone deposits on our property have been depleted but the tenant still has a need for the leased land, we collect a minimum annual rental amount. We believe strongly in the potential for future growth in construction in Florida, Georgia, and Virginia which would positively benefit our profitability in this segment. 
 The major expenses in this segment are comprised of collection and accounting for royalties, management s oversight of the mining leases, land entitlement for post-mining uses and property taxes at our non-leased locations and at our Grandin location which, unlike our other leased mining locations, are not entirely paid by the tenant. As such, our costs in this business are very low as a percentage of revenue, are relatively stable and are not affected by increases in production at our locations. Our current mining tenants include Vulcan Materials, Martin Marietta, Cemex, Summit Materials and The Concrete Company. 
 Additionally, these locations provide us with opportunities for valuable second lives for these assets through proper land planning and entitlement.

 Development Segment. 
 Through our Development segment, we own and are continuously monitoring for the highest and best use of several parcels of land that are in various stages of development. Our overall strategy in this segment is to convert all our non-income producing lands into income production through (i) an orderly process of constructing new commercial and residential buildings for us to own and operate or (ii) a sale to, or joint venture with, outside parties. Additionally, our Development segment will purchase land or form joint ventures for new developments of land not previously owned by the Company. 
 Revenues in this segment are generated predominately from land sales and interim property rents. The significant cash outlays incurred in this segment are for land acquisition costs, entitlement costs, property taxes, design and permitting, the personnel costs of our in-house management team and horizontal and vertical construction costs. 
 Development Segment Warehouse/Office Land. 
 At September 30, 2024, this segment owned the following future development parcels: 
 1) 54 acres of land that will be capable of supporting up to 635,000 square feet of industrial product located at 1001 Old Philadelphia Road in Aberdeen, MD. 
 2) 17 acres of land in Harford County, MD that accommodates a 258,000 square foot speculative warehouse project on Chelsea Road under construction due to be complete in the fourth quarter of 2024. 
 3) 170 acres of land in Cecil County, MD that can accommodate 900,000 square feet of industrial development. 
 We also have three properties that were either spun off to us from Florida Rock Industries in 1986 or acquired by us from unrelated third parties. These properties, as a result of our highest and best use studies, are being prepared for income generation through sale or joint venture with third parties, and in certain cases we are leasing these properties on an interim basis for an income stream while we wait for the development market to mature.

Executive Summary and Analysis In the third quarter, the Company saw a 39 improvement in pro rata NOI compared to the same period last year, and a 28 increase in pro rata NOI in the first nine months compared to the same period last year. This is consistent with the 26.4 CAGR at which we have grown pro rata NOI over the last three years on a trailing twelve month basis. The growth in pro rata NOI for the third quarter was driven by increases across all segments but particularly in the Mining and Royalties segment (80 increase). The substantial increase in Mining Royalty NOI was due to a 2 million increase in unrealized revenue. This was mostly the result of a one-time, minimum royalty payment at one location which is straight-lined across the life of the lease for GAAP revenue purposes. 
 
 Shell construction is nearly complete for our Chelsea Project in Harford County, MD, which we expect to come in under budget and exceed our underwriting expectations upon stabilization. We are working to get shovel ready the sites of our two industrial JV s in Florida with an anticipated construction start for both in March of 2025. These three projects represent 640,000 square feet of new, Class A, industrial product requiring 116 million in total capex and are in keeping with our stated strategy of focusing on industrial development . We have underwritten all these projects at an unlevered 6-7 yield . 
 
 Third Quarter Highlights 
 8 increase in Net Income 1.4 million vs 1.3 million) 
 39 increase in pro rata NOI 11.3 million vs 8.1 million) 
 Pro rata NOI includes a one-time, catch-up, minimum royalty payment of 1.9 million that applies to the prior twenty-four months as the tenant failed to meet a production requirement contained in the lease. This revenue was straight-lined over the life of the lease. 
 23 increase in the Multifamily segment s pro rata NOI primarily due to lease up of Bryant St., 408 Jackson, and The Verge. This comparison includes the results for these three projects from the same period last year (when these projects were still in our Development segment).

Total operating profit before G A for the consolidated joint ventures was 1,559,000, an increase of 519,000, or 50 versus 1,040,000 in the same period last year primarily due to lower depreciation and operating expenses. Depreciation decreased as some of the assets became fully depreciated. Operating expenses decreased due to lower maintenance, utilities, insurance and marketing costs. 
 
 Multifamily Segment (Pro rata unconsolidated) 
 Our Multifamily Segment has four unconsolidated joint ventures (Bryant Street, The Verge, Riverside, and .408 Jackson). Riverside was moved from the Development segment to the Multifamily segment in 2022, Bryant Street and .408 Jackson moved as of the beginning of 2024 and The Verge moved effective July 1, 2024, each upon reaching lease up stabilization.

With respect to ongoing Development Segment projects: 
 
 We entered into two new joint venture agreements in early 2024 with BBX Logistics. The first joint venture is a 200,000 square-foot warehouse development project in Lakeland, FL, and the second joint venture is a 182,000 square-foot warehouse redevelopment project in Broward County, FL. We anticipate construction to start on both projects in the first quarter of 2025. 
 
 Last summer we broke ground on a new speculative warehouse project in Aberdeen, MD on Chelsea Road. Vertical construction is underway. This Class A, 258,000 square foot building is due to be complete in the 4th quarter of 2024. 
 
 We are the principal capital source to develop 344 residential lots on 110 acres in Harford County, MD. We have funded 25.5 million of our 31.1 million total commitment. A national homebuilder is under contract to purchase all 222 townhome lots and 122 single family lots. At quarter-end, 79 lots have been sold and 12.9 million of preferred interest and principal has been returned to the company of which 3.6 million was booked as profit to the Company.

 Pro rata NOI includes a one-time, catch-up, minimum royalty payment of 1,853,000 that applies to the prior twenty-four months as the tenant failed to meet a production requirement contained in the lease. This revenue was straight-lined over the life of the lease. 
 Net investment income increased 588,000 due to increased earnings on cash equivalents 1,252,000) and increased income from our lending ventures 1,155,000), partially offset by decreased preferred interest 1,819,000) due to the conversion of FRP preferred equity to common equity at Bryant Street.

We were 95.6 leased and occupied during the entire period. Net operating income in this segment was 3,555,000, up 829,000 or 30 compared to the same period last year partially due to 519,000 more unrealized rental revenue in the prior year due to rent abatements that expired in 2023.

 Credit Facilities - On December 22, 2023, the Company entered into a 2023 Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the "Credit Agreement") with Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. Wells Fargo ). The Credit Agreement modifies the Company s prior Credit Agreement with Wells Fargo, dated January 30, 2015. The Credit Agreement establishes a three-year revolving credit facility with a maximum facility amount of 35 million. The interest rate under the Credit Agreement will be 2.25 over Daily Simple SOFR. A commitment fee of 0.35 per annum is payable quarterly on the unused portion of the commitment. The credit agreement contains certain conditions and financial covenants, including a minimum tangible net worth and dividend restriction. As of September 30, 2024, these covenants would have limited our ability to pay dividends to a maximum of 102.6 million combined.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures. 
 To supplement the financial results presented in accordance with GAAP, FRP presents certain non-GAAP financial measures within the meaning of Regulation G promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission. We believe these non-GAAP measures provide useful information to our Board of Directors, management and investors regarding certain trends relating to our financial condition and results of operations. Our management uses these non-GAAP measures to compare our performance to that of prior periods for trend analyses, purposes of determining management incentive compensation and budgeting, forecasting and planning purposes. We provide Pro rata net operating income (NOI) because we believe it assists investors and analysts in estimating our economic interest in our consolidated and unconsolidated partnerships, when read in conjunction with our reported results under GAAP. This measure is not, and should not be viewed as, a substitute for GAAP financial measures. For ease of comparison all the figures in the tables below include the results for Bryant Street, .408 Jackson, and The Verge in the Multifamily segment for all periods shown.

 ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKS 
 Interest Rate Risk - We are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes through our variable-rate borrowings under our Credit Agreement with Wells Fargo. 
 Under the Wells Fargo Credit Agreement, the applicable margin for borrowings at September 30, 2024 was Daily simple SOFR plus 2.25 . 
 The Company did not have any variable rate debt at September 30, 2024, so a sensitivity analysis was not performed to determine the impact of hypothetical changes in interest rates on the Company s results of operations and cash flows. 
 
 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 CONCLUSION REGARDING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the Company s reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Company s Chief Executive Officer CEO and Chief Financial Officer CFO ), as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 The Company also maintains a system of internal accounting controls over financial reporting that are designed to provide reasonable assurance to the Company s management and Board of Directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements. 
 All control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company's management, including the CEO, CFO and CAO, carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures. Based on this evaluation, the Company s CEO, CFO and CAO concluded that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures are effective in alerting them in a timely manner to material information required to be included in periodic SEC filings. 
 There have been no changes in the Company s internal controls over financial reporting during our most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
