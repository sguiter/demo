 Acquisition of Broadmark Asset Management LLC 
 We acquired a interest in Broadmark Asset Management LLC ("Broadmark") as a result of our 2022 acquisition of the asset management business of Salient Partners, L.P. (the "Salient Acquisition"). In January 2023 we acquired an additional interest in Broadmark for million (net of cash acquired), increasing our ownership of Broadmark to approximately , which represents a controlling interest for financial statement consolidation purposes (the "Broadmark Acquisition"). Broadmark is a San Francisco-based registered investment adviser ("RIA") managing and/or sub-advising mutual funds, retail and institutional separately-managed accounts.

 Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
 Segment Reporting 
 In November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures , which requires an entity to disclose significant segment expenses and other segment items on an annual and interim basis, and provide in interim periods all disclosures about a reportable segment s profit or loss and assets that are currently required annually. Additionally, it requires an entity to disclose the title and position of the Chief Operating Decision Maker. This ASU does not change how an entity identifies its operating segments, aggregates them, or applies the quantitative thresholds to determine its reportable segments. The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. An entity should apply the amendments in this ASU retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the financial statements. We expect this ASU to impact our disclosures, with no impact to our results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.

 Income Taxes 
 In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures , which focuses on the income tax rate reconciliation and income taxes paid. ASU 2023-09 requires an entity to disclose, on an annual basis, a tabular rate reconciliation using both percentages and currency amounts, broken out into specified categories, with certain reconciling items further broken out by nature and jurisdiction to the extent those items exceed a specified threshold. In addition, entities are required to disclose income taxes paid, net of refunds received disaggregated by federal, state/local, and foreign, and by jurisdiction if the amount is at least 5 of total income tax payments, net of refunds received. The new standard is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. An entity may apply the amendments in this ASU prospectively by providing the revised disclosures for the period ending December 31, 2025 and continuing to provide the pre-ASU disclosures for the prior periods, or may apply the amendments retrospectively by providing the revised disclosures for all periods presented. We expect this ASU to impact our disclosures, with no impact to our results of operations, cash flows, or financial condition. 
 
 3. BUSINESS COMBINATIONS 
 Broadmark 
 Westwood completed the Broadmark Acquisition in January 2023, increasing our investment by approximately , to , giving Westwood a controlling interest and requiring an allocation of the Broadmark Acquisition purchase price. The total consideration recorded for accounting purposes consisted of million in cash (net of cash acquired). 
 Prior to the Broadmark Acquisition, Westwood had a million equity method investment in Broadmark, the fair value of which was estimated using recent market transactions. Westwood's equity method investment was derecognized without gain or loss following the Broadmark Acquisition, however there was a corresponding increase to goodwill. 
 The Broadmark Acquisition was accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting. Accordingly, the purchase price was allocated to tangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date. The total consideration of million has been allocated based on valuations of acquired assets and assumed liabilities in connection with the acquisition. 
 The allocation of the Broadmark Acquisition purchase price was as follows (in thousands): 
 Cash consideration Cash acquired ) Total consideration, net of cash acquired Fair value of Westwood's investment in Broadmark before the business combination Fair value of noncontrolling interest in Broadmark Assets Accounts receivable Other current assets Property and equipment Other long-term assets Liabilities Accounts payable and accrued liabilities Total Identifiable Net Assets Goodwill 
 
 Westwood recognized approximately million of a noncontrolling interest in a consolidated subsidiary at the acquisition date. Fair value of this interest was estimated using recent market transactions. 
 At the time of the Broadmark Acquisition, the Company believed that its expanded operational opportunities, enhanced range of investment strategies and expected realization of synergies were the primary factors that contributed to a total purchase price that resulted in the recognition of goodwill. Goodwill arising from the Broadmark Acquisition is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes.

 Prior to our exchange of Charis shares for shares in Vista in 2023, our investment in Charis was included within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy as we valued it utilizing inputs not observable in the market. Historically, our investment was measured at fair value on a recurring basis using a market approach based on either a price to tangible book value multiple range determined to be reasonable in the current environment, or on market transactions. On April 3, 2023, Charis was acquired by Vista in a transaction in which the Company exchanged its shares in Charis for shares in Vista.

 The September 30, 2024 contingent consideration fair value of million was valued based upon updated revenue growth projections following asset appreciation in the quarter and revised asset flow expectations. The fair value of contingent consideration related to both the revenue retention earn-out and the growth earn-out is measured using the Monte Carlo simulation model, which considered assumptions including revenue growth projections, revenue volatility, risk free rates and discount rates. The projected contingent payment is discounted to the current period using a discounted cash flow model. Increases or decreases in projected revenues, probabilities of payment, discount rates, projected payment dates and other inputs may result in significantly higher or lower fair value measurements. 
 The following table represents the range of the unobservable inputs utilized in the fair value measurement of the contingent consideration classified as level 3, the weighted averages represent the output of the Monte Carlo simulation models:

 Based on our analyses, we determined that the CTFs, Private Funds and Zarvona Energy Fund II-A were VIEs, as the at-risk equity holders do not have the ability to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entities' economic performance, and, while the Company and its representatives have a majority control of the entities' respective boards of directors and can influence the respective entities' management and affairs, the Company is not exposed to a majority of the economics of those entities and does not qualify as primary beneficiaries for those entities. As we do not qualify as primary beneficiaries for those entities, we have not consolidated our investments in those entities for the periods ending September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
 Based on our analyses, we determined the Westwood Funds , InvestCloud, Vista, and Zarvona Energy Fund GP (i) have sufficient equity at risk to finance the entities' activities independently, (ii) have the obligation to absorb losses, the right to receive residual returns and the right to direct the activities of the entities that most significantly impact the entities' economic performance and (iii) are not structured with disproportionate voting rights and are VOEs. As we do not own controlling financial interests in those entities, we have not consolidated our investments in those entities for the periods ending September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
 We recognized fee revenue from the Westwood VIEs and Westwood VOEs as follows (in millions): Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 September 30, 2023 September 30, 2024 September 30, 2023 Fee Revenues

 Overview 
 We manage investment assets and provide services for our clients through our subsidiaries, Westwood Management Corp., Westwood Advisors, L.L.C. and Salient Advisors, LP (each of which is an SEC-registered investment advisor and referred to hereinafter together as Westwood Management and Westwood Trust. Westwood Management provides investment advisory services to institutional investors, a family of mutual funds called the Westwood Funds , other mutual funds, individuals and clients of Westwood Trust. 
 Westwood Trust provides trust and custodial services and participation in common trust funds to institutions and high net worth individuals. Our revenues are generally derived from fees based on a percentage of AUM. 
 Our revenues are generally derived from fees based on a percentage of AUM and AUA, and Westwood Management and Westwood Trust collectively had AUM of approximately 16.8 billion and AUA of approximately 1.0 billion at September 30, 2024. We have established a track record of delivering competitive, risk-adjusted returns for our clients. 
 With respect to most of our AUM, we utilize a value investment style focused on achieving superior long-term, risk-adjusted returns by investing in companies with high levels of free cash flow, improving returns on equity and strengthening balance sheets that are well positioned for growth but whose value is not fully recognized in the marketplace. This investment approach is designed to limit downside during unfavorable periods and provide superior real returns over the long term. Our investment teams have significant industry experience. Our investment team members have an average investment experience of over twenty years. 
 We have built a foundation in terms of personnel and infrastructure to support a much larger business and we have developed investment strategies that we believe will be sought after within our target institutional, wealth management and intermediary markets. Developing new products and growing the organization has resulted in our incurring expenses that, in some cases, have not yet generated significant offsetting revenues. We believe that investors will recognize the potential for new revenue streams inherent in these products and services; however, there is no guarantee that they will occur. 
 Revenues 
 We derive our revenues from investment advisory fees, trust fees and other revenues. Our advisory fees are generated by Westwood Management, which manages client accounts under investment advisory and sub-advisory agreements. Advisory fees are typically calculated based on a percentage of AUM and AUA and are paid in accordance with the terms of the agreements. Advisory fees are paid quarterly in advance based on AUM on the last day of the preceding quarter, quarterly in arrears based on AUM on the last day of the quarter just ended or are based on a daily or monthly analysis of AUM for the stated period. We recognize advisory fee revenues as services are rendered. Certain of our clients have a contractual performance-based fee component in their contracts, which generates additional revenues if we outperform a specified index over a specific period of time. We record revenue for performance-based fees at the end of the measurement period. Since our advance paying clients billing periods coincide with the calendar quarter to which such payments relate, revenue is recognized within the quarter, and our Consolidated Financial Statements contain no deferred advisory fee revenues. 
 Our trust fees are generated by Westwood Trust pursuant to trust or custodial agreements. Trust fees are separately negotiated with each client and are generally based on a percentage of AUM. Westwood Trust also provides trust services to a small number of clients on a fixed fee basis. Trust fees are primarily calculated quarterly in arrears based on a daily average of AUM for the quarter. Since billing periods for most of Westwood Trust's clients coincide with the calendar quarter, revenue is fully recognized within the quarter, and our Consolidated Financial Statements contain no deferred advisory fee revenues. 
 Our other revenues primarily consist of investment income from seed money investments into new investment strategies. 
 Employee Compensation and Benefits 
 Employee compensation and benefits costs generally consist of salaries, sales commissions, incentive compensation, stock-based compensation expense and benefits. 
 Sales and Marketing 
 19

 Westwood Mutual Funds

 Professional Services

 General and Administrative 
 General and administrative expenses generally consist of costs associated with the lease of office space, amortization, depreciation, insurance, custody expense, Directors' fees, investor relations, licenses and fees, office supplies and other miscellaneous expenses. 
 (Gain) loss from change in fair value of contingent consideration 
 (Gain) loss from change in fair value of contingent consideration consists of fair value adjustments related to contingent consideration from our 2022 acquisition of Salient, with gains representing reductions in value and losses representing increases in value.

 Net investment income primarily includes interest and dividend income on fixed income securities and money market funds. 
 Other Income 
 Other income primarily consists of income from the sublease of a portion of our corporate offices and the receipt of life insurance proceeds. 
 
 Firm-wide Assets Under Management 
 Firm-wide assets under management of 17.7 billion at September 30, 2024 consisted of 16.8 billion of AUM and 1.0 billion of AUA. 
 AUM increased 2.4 billion to 16.8 billion at September 30, 2024 compared with 14.4 billion at September 30, 2023. The average of beginning and ending AUM for the third quarter of 2024 was 16.3 billion compared to 14.7 billion for the third quarter of 2023.

 Supplemental Financial Information 
 As supplemental information, we are providing non-GAAP performance measures that we refer to as Economic Earnings and Economic EPS. We provide these measures in addition to, not as a substitute for, comprehensive income attributable to Westwood Holdings Group, Inc. and earnings per share, which are reported on a GAAP basis. Our management and Board of Directors review Economic Earnings and Economic EPS to evaluate our ongoing performance, allocate resources, and review our dividend policy. We believe that these non-GAAP performance measures, while not substitutes for GAAP comprehensive income attributable to Westwood Holdings Group, Inc. or earnings per share, are useful for management and investors when evaluating our underlying operating and financial performance and our available resources. We do not advocate that investors consider these non-GAAP measures without also considering financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. 
 We define Economic Earnings as comprehensive income attributable to Westwood Holdings Group, Inc. plus non-cash equity-based compensation expense, amortization of intangible assets and deferred taxes related to goodwill. Although depreciation on fixed assets is a non-cash expense, we do not add it back when calculating Economic Earnings because depreciation charges represent an allocation of the decline in the value of the related assets that will ultimately require replacement. Although gains and losses from changes in the fair value of contingent consideration are non-cash, we do not add or subtract those back when calculating Economic Earnings because gains and losses on changes in the fair value of contingent consideration are considered regular following an acquisition. In addition, we do not adjust Economic Earnings for tax deductions related to restricted stock expense or amortization of intangible assets. Economic EPS represents Economic Earnings divided by diluted weighted average shares outstanding. 
 The following tables (in thousands, except share and per share amounts) provide a reconciliation of comprehensive income attributable to Westwood Holdings Group, Inc. to Economic Earnings and Economic Earnings by segment. We have included the tax impact of adjustments for all periods presented.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Historically we have funded our operations and cash requirements with cash generated from operating activities. We may also use cash from operations to pay dividends to our stockholders or for deferred contingent consideration payments. We had no debt as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The changes in net cash provided by operating activities generally reflect changes in earnings plus the effects of non-cash items and changes in working capital, including liquidation of investments used to cover current liabilities. Changes in working capital, especially accounts receivable and accounts payable, are generally the result of timing differences between collection of fees billed and payment of operating expenses. 
 We had cash and short-term investments of 48.3 million and 53.1 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, working capital aggregated 52.5 million and 53.6 million, respectively. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, cash flow provided by operating activities was 12.2 million, which included net sales of current investments of 6.3 million and a reduction in compensation and benefits payable of 1.3 million. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, cash flow used in operating activities was 5.7 million, which included net purchases of current investments of 15.6 million and a reduction in compensation and benefits payable of 1.4 million. 
 Cash flow used in investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was related to the purchase of investments. Cash flow provided by investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to the receipt of life insurance proceeds, offset by cash for the Broadmark Acquisition. 
 Cash flows used in financing activities of 8.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 reflected the payment of dividends, deferred contingent consideration payments, purchases of treasury stock and restricted stock returned for the payment of taxes. Cash flows used in financing activities of 5.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 reflected the payment of dividends and restricted stock returned for the payment of taxes. 
 26 

Westwood Trust is required to maintain cash and investments in an amount equal to the minimum restricted capital of 4.0 million, as required by the Texas Finance Code. Restricted capital is included in Investments in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. At September 30, 2024, Westwood Trust had approximately 12.3 million in excess of its minimum capital requirement. 
 Our future liquidity and capital requirements will depend upon numerous factors, including our results of operations, the timing and magnitude of capital expenditures or strategic initiatives, our dividend policy and other business and risk factors described under Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. We believe that current cash and short-term investment balances plus cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet both the operating and capital requirements of our ordinary business operations through at least the next twelve months, however there can be no assurance that we will not require additional financing within this time frame. Failure to raise needed capital on attractive terms, if at all, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
