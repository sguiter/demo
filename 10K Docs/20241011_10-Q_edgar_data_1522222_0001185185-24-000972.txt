Nature of Business 

CLS Holdings USA, Inc. (the Company was originally incorporated as Adelt Design, Inc. Adelt on March 31, 2011 to manufacture and market carpet binding art. Production and marketing of carpet binding art never commenced. 

We currently operate a retail marijuana dispensary within walking distance to the Las Vegas Strip and a small-scale cultivation facility, as well as a product manufacturing facility and a wholesale distribution operation in North Las Vegas. The vertically integrated business model drives strong margins to the bottom line on a portion of sales at the dispensary. 

Our retail dispensary is a single location operation in Nevada and occupies over 5,000 square feet. This location, which is easily accessible by tourists, is currently open 19.5 hours per day for walk-in service. Curbside and in store express pick up is available between the hours of 8:00 AM and 12:00 AM. Oasis dispensary also delivers cannabis to residents between the hours of 8:00 AM and 10:00 PM. The central location provides logistical convenience for delivery to all parts of the Las Vegas valley. 

Our wholesale operations, which occupies approximately 10,000 square feet of a 22,000 square foot warehouse, began sales to third parties in August 2017 and completed construction and received a certificate of occupancy for its state-of-the-art extraction facility in December of 2019. We have made sales to over 85 external customers as of August 31, 2024. Our existing product line includes vaporizers, tinctures, ethanol produced THC distillate, and live and cured hydrocarbon concentrates. At present, the City Trees cultivation facility only grows breeding stock to preserve valuable genetics and does not offer its crops for sale or processing. As a result, all raw materials for manufacturing are sourced from third parties.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 

History 

We were incorporated on March 31, 2011 as Adelt Design, Inc. to manufacture and market carpet binding art. Production and marketing of carpet binding art never commenced. On November 20, 2014, we adopted amended and restated articles of incorporation, thereby changing our name to CLS Holdings USA, Inc. On April 29, 2015, we entered into a merger agreement with CLS Labs and a newly-formed, wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (the Merger Sub and effected the Merger (the Merger ). Upon the consummation of the Merger, the separate existence of the Merger Sub ceased and CLS Labs, the surviving corporation in the Merger, became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, with the Company acquiring the stock of CLS Labs. As a result of the Merger, we acquired the business of CLS Labs and abandoned our previous business. 

CLS Labs was originally incorporated in the state of Nevada on May 1, 2014 under the name RJF Labs, Inc. before changing its name to CLS Labs, Inc. on October 24, 2014. It was formed to commercialize a proprietary method of extracting cannabinoids from cannabis plants and converting the resulting cannabinoid extracts into concentrates such as oils, waxes, edibles and shatter. 

We have been issued a U.S. patent with respect to our proprietary method of extracting cannabinoids from cannabis plants and converting the resulting cannabinoid extracts into concentrates such as oils, waxes, edibles and shatter. We have not commercialized our proprietary process and due to the current Nevada State laws governing these types of extraction methods, we do not intend to commercialize the proprietary process in the future. CLSH is engaged in attempting to find a buyer for the patent who may be able to use it in another state or another application. 

Current Business and Outlook 

We generate revenues through: (i) our retail dispensary (Oasis), and (ii) our City Trees cultivation and processing of cannabis and wholesale of cannabis-related products for Oasis and third-parties. We continue to explore opportunities for growth through the acquisition of companies, the creation of joint ventures, licensing agreements, and fee-for-service arrangements with growers and dispensaries of cannabis products. We believe that we can ultimately establish a position as one of the premier cannabinoid extraction and processing companies in the industry. We have created our own brand of concentrates for consumer use, which we sell wholesale to cannabis dispensaries. We are attempting to create a gold standard national brand by standardizing the testing, compliance and labeling of our products in an industry currently comprised of small, local businesses with erratic and unreliable product quality, testing practices and labeling. 

Finally, we intend to grow through select acquisitions in secondary and tertiary markets, targeting newly regulated states that we believe offer a competitive advantage. Our goal at this time is to become a successful regional cannabis company.

Cost of goods sold during the first quarter of the 2024 fiscal year primarily consisted of product cost of 2,400,010, labor and overhead of 331,127, supplies and materials of 100,989, and licenses and fees of 8,475. 

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 

Selling, general and administrative expenses, or SG A, decreased by 545,067, or approximately 20 , to 2,184,833 during the three months ended August 31, 2024, compared to 2,729,900 for the three months ended August 31, 2023. The decrease in SG A expenses for the three months ended August 31, 2024 was primarily due to decreases in payroll and related costs in the amount of 162,252 and professional fees in the amount of 154,910. 

SG A expense during the three months ended August 31, 2024 was primarily attributable to an aggregate of 1,701,524 in costs associated with operating the Oasis LLCs, a decrease of 504,356 compared to 2,205,880 during the three months ended August 31, 2023. The major components of the decrease were as follows: professional fees of 42,300 compared to 230,872; office expenses of 476,556 compared to 550,336; payroll and related costs of 1,113,163 compared to 1,171,719; sales and marketing costs of 76,456 compared to 115,461; and taxes licenses of 159,582 compared to 187,586. The amount of SG A expenses allocated to cost of sales during the period also increased from 362,926 to 403,228, further reducing the net amount of SG A expenses. There were no categories of SG A expenses that increased during the period compared to the prior year. 

Finally, SG A decreased by 40,711 during the three months ended August 31, 2024 as a result of an increase in the expenses associated with the ongoing implementation of other aspects of our business plan and our general corporate overhead to 483,310 from 524,021 during the three months ended August 31, 2023. The major component of this decrease compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2025 was a decrease in payroll and related costs of 103,696. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in professional fees in the amount of 33,662 and non-cash compensation in the amount of 28,802. 

Interest Expense, Net 

Our interest expense was 159,403 for the three months ended August 31, 2024, a decrease of 298,069, or 65 , compared to 457,472 for the three months ended August 31, 2023. The decrease consisted primarily of a decrease in the amount 152,421 related to the amortization of discounts on notes payable; a decrease in the amount of 77,296 related to interest on our notes and debentures due to decreased principal balances; a decrease in the amount of 64,812 in connection our short term financing arrangements due to decreased principal balances; and a decrease in the amount of 3,540 in connection with our financing leases, also due to reduced principal balances. 

Employee Retention Tax Credit 

During the three months ended August 31, 2023, the Company received the amount of 924,862 under the provisions of the extension of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the CARES Act ). This amount was recorded as other income. There was no comparable transaction in the current period.

Gain on settlement of accounts payable 

During the three months ended August 31, 2023, we settled an outstanding vendor account in the amount of 8,375 for a cash payment of 4,000 representing a gain in the amount of 4,375. There was no comparable transaction in the current period. 

Provision for Income Taxes 

We recorded a provision for income taxes in the amount of 524,896 during the three months ended August 31, 2024 compared to 477,624 during the three months ended August 31, 2023. Although we have net operating losses that we believe are available to us to offset this entire tax liability, which arises under Section 280E of the Code because we are a cannabis company, as a conservative measure, we have accrued this liability. 

Net Loss 

For the reasons above, our net loss for the three months ended August 31, 2024 was 820,863 compared to a net loss of 461,733 for the three months ended August 31, 2023, an increase of 359,130, or 78 . 

Non-Controlling Interest 

During the three months ended August 31, 2024 and 2023, the income (loss) associated with the non-controlling interest in Kealii Okamalu was 0) and 2,108), respectively. This amount is comprised of the third-party portion of the operating loss of the Quinn River Joint Venture and our loss on equity investment. 

Net Loss Attributable to CLS Holdings USA, Inc . 

Our net loss attributable to CLS Holdings USA, Inc. for the three months ended August 31, 2024 was 820,863 compared to a net loss of 463,841 for the three months ended August 31, 2023, an increase of 357,022 or 77 . 

Non-GAAP Measures 

EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP financial performance measures and should not be considered as alternatives to net income(loss) or any other measure derived in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP measure have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our financial results as reported in accordance with GAAP. Because not all companies use identical calculations, these presentations may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. As required by the rules of the SEC, we provide below a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures contained herein to the most directly comparable measure under GAAP. Management believes that EBITDA provides relevant and useful information, which is widely used by analysts, investors and competitors in our industry as well as by our management. Management also believes that adjusting EBITDA for the effects of non-recurring transactions may provide insight into the nature of the core business. By providing these non-GAAP profitability measure, management intends to provide investors with a meaningful, consistent comparison of our profitability measures for the periods presented.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Since our inception we have funded our operations and capital spending primarily through the issuance of debt and common stock. At August 31, 2024, we had cash of 3,121,349 (including restricted cash in the amount of 2,600,000) and a working capital deficit of 9,784,390; at October 8, 2024, we had cash of 941,951. We generated cash flow from operating activities of 252,250 for the three months ended August 31, 2024, compared to 783,250 for the three months ended August 31, 2023. As of August 31, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of 114,187,913. The Company s auditors have included a going concern qualification in their audit report for the years ended May 31, 2024 and 2023. 

During the past two years, we have been involved in a focused effort to reduce our debt burden through a combination of settlements, restructurings, principal payments, and conversions of debt to common stock. The following table illustrates the results of these efforts:

We intend to continue these efforts to further reduce our debt burden in the coming year. During the three months ended August 31, 2024, we raised 2,600,000 from the issuance of a note payable to a related party; 2,200,000 of this amount was converted to 56,847,545 shares of common stock during the period, and 400,000 remains on the balance sheet as a note payable at August 31, 2024. The 2,600,000 was used to retire debt in the aggregate principal amount of 2,868,282 in September 2024. We believe we have resources in place with existing and prospective lenders to continue to reduce our debt burden, though there can be no guarantee that this will be the case. 

Our working capital deficit is due primarily to accruals for taxes payable under Section 280E of the Internal Revenue Code in the amount of 9,424,759 and 8,899,863 at August 31, 2024. It is the Company s position that these taxes will not ultimately be owed. Removing this amount from the calculation of net working capital results in a working capital deficit of 359,631 at August 31, 2024. 

The Company continues to generate positive cash flow from operating activities, which were 252,250 for the three months ended August 31, 2024 compared to 783,250 for the three months ended August 31, 2023. We intend to continue to focus on operational activities in order to further improve our cash flow. 

We have one potential capital expenditure project planned for fiscal 2025, which is our proposed 3,700 square foot cannabis consumption lounge and 300 square foot outdoor patio area to be attached to the Oasis dispensary. We expect this project to require a capital expenditure in the range of 500,000 to 1,000,000, depending upon various buildout decisions. 

We believe the resources are available to execute our business plan in the coming year from existing and prospective investors and from internally generated cash flow, though there is no guarantee that this will be the case. 

Going Concern 

Our financial statements were prepared using accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America applicable to a going concern, which contemplate the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. With the exception of the first quarter of fiscal 2022, we have incurred losses from operations since inception, and have an accumulated deficit of 114,371,372 as of August 31, 2024, compared to 113,367,050 as of May 31, 2024. We had a working capital deficit of 9,784,390 as of August 31, 2024, compared to a working capital deficit of 10,928,252 as of May 31, 2024. The report of our independent auditors for the year ended May 31, 2024 contained a going concern qualification. 

28

Table of Contents 

Our ability to continue as a going concern must be considered in light of the problems, expenses, and complications frequently encountered by early-stage companies. 

Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on our ability to generate sufficient cash from operations to meet our cash needs and finance our ongoing operations. There can be no assurance that cash generated by our future operations will be adequate to meet our needs. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors. 

Critical Accounting Estimates 

Management uses various estimates and assumptions in preparing our financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and the reported revenues and expenses. Accounting estimates that are the most important to the presentation of our results of operations and financial condition, and which require the greatest use of judgment by management, are designated as our critical accounting estimates. We have the following critical accounting estimates: 

Estimates and assumptions regarding the deductibility of expenses for purposes of Section 280E of the Internal Revenue Code: Management evaluates the expenses of its manufacturing and retail operations and makes certain judgments regarding the deductibility of various expenses under Section 280E of the Internal Revenue Code based on its interpretation of this regulation and its subjective assumptions about the categorization of these expenses. 

Estimates and assumptions used in the valuation of derivative liabilities: Management utilizes a lattice model to estimate the fair value of derivative liabilities. The model includes subjective assumptions that can materially affect the fair value estimates. 

Estimates and assumptions used in the valuation of intangible assets. In order to value our intangible assets, management prepares multi-year projections of revenue, costs of goods sold, gross margin, operating expenses, taxes and after tax margins relating to the operations associated with the intangible assets being valued. These projections are based on the estimates of management at the time they are prepared and include subjective assumptions regarding industry growth and other matters. 

Recently Issued Accounting Standards 

Accounting standards promulgated by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the FASB are subject to change. Changes in such standards may have an impact on our future financial statements. The following are a summary of recent accounting developments. 

In August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06, Debt Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging Contracts in Entity s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40) . This ASU reduces the number of accounting models for convertible debt instruments and convertible Preferred Stock. As well as amend the guidance for the derivatives scope exception for contracts in an entity s own equity to reduce form-over-substance-based accounting conclusions. In addition, this ASU improves and amends the related EPS guidance. This standard is effective for us on June 1, 2024, including interim periods within such fiscal year. Adoption is either a modified retrospective method or a fully retrospective method of transition. We do not expect the implementation of this standard to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. 

There are various other updates recently issued, most of which represented technical corrections to the accounting literature or application to specific industries and are not expected to a have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure about Market Risk. 

This item is not applicable as we are currently considered a smaller reporting company. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 

Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, among other things, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file under the Securities Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive and financial officers, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Andrew Glashow, our Chief Executive Officer, and Principal Financial and Accounting Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) as of the end of the period covered by this report. The Company believes it now has an adequate number of trained personnel to resolve any segregation of duties deficiencies. Based on the evaluation, Mr. Glashow concluded that: 

We do not have an independent body to oversee our internal controls over financial reporting due to our limited resources. 

We plan to rectify these weaknesses by hiring additional accounting personnel once we have additional resources to do so. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There have been no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during our last fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
