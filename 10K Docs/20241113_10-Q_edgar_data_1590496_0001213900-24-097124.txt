ownership of Beijing Yatai was transferred from Aircom
Taiwan to Aerkomm Taiwan. 

On October 31, 2019, Aerkomm SY established
a new a wholly owned subsidiary, Aerkomm Pacific Limited Aerkomm Malta ), a corporation formed under the laws of Malta.
The purpose of Aerkomm Malta is to conduct Aerkomm s business and operations and to engage with suppliers and potential airlines
customers in the European Union. 

The Company s organization structure
is as following: 

On September 04, 2022, Aerkomm acquired
a wholly owned subsidiary, MEPA Labs Inc. (MEPA), a California corporation. The purpose of the acquisition is to extend business development
and operations related to the satellite products. 

On September 28, 2023, Aerkomm acquired
a wholly owned subsidiary, Mixnet Technology Limited (Mixnet) and its wholly owned subsidiary, Mesh Technology Taiwan Limited (Mesh),
a Taiwan company. The purpose of the acquisition is to extend business development and operations related to the satellite products. Mixnet s
name changed to Mesh Technology Limited as of September 7, 2023. 

On March 29, 2024, the Company entered
into a merger agreement (the Merger Agreement with IX Acquisition Corp. IXAQ ), a Cayman Islands exempted
company (which will re-domicile from being a Cayman Islands company and become a Delaware corporation), and AKOM Merger Sub Inc., a Nevada
corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of IQAC Merger Sub ). The Merger Agreement provides that, among other things and
upon the terms and subject to the conditions thereof, following the domestication to Delaware of IXAQ, Merger Sub will merge with and
into the Company (the Merger ), after which the Company will be the surviving corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of
IXAQ. In connection with the Merger, IXAQ will be renamed AKOM Inc. The Merger will become effective upon the filing of
the certificate of merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or at such later time as is agreed to by the parties to
the Merger Agreement and specified in the articles of merger. 

Liquidity 

The accompanying financial statements
have been prepared on a going concern basis. The Company's ability to remain solvent and settle its obligations when they come due is
dependent on its ability to raise additional capital in the form of permanent equity and to successfully gain listing of its common stock
on a national exchange such as the NASDAQ capital markets, so that its current investors that have invested in the form of convertible
debt and convertible notes are incentivized to convert their debt holdings into common stock that could be traded in an orderly market.
As result of the Company s primary operations being in the area of research and development of communication equipment in the aerospace
industry that is still in the testing phases, the Company has not yet been able to legally market and to generate sustainable re-occurring
revenue from the sales of its products; however, the Company does believe that it has made significant progress towards gaining approval
from the FAA and other regulatory agencies, but success is not guaranteed. As a function of the Company s continued efforts to develop
its products the Company reported a net loss of and net cash outflows of for the nine months ended September 30,
2024, and as of September 30, 2024, the Company had a working capital deficit of approximately Million because much of the investment
from investors were still in the form of convertible debt instruments that are either at, or near their maturity dates. These conditions
give rise to substantial doubt and uncertainty regarding the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. If the Company is
able to carry out its plans as detailed below within one operating period, the Company could alleviate this doubt.

million bridge
loan (together, the Loan Commitments and loans made under the Loan Commitments, Loans for an aggregate
committed principal amount of million, to bridge the Company s cash flow needs prior to its obtaining a mortgage loan to be
secured by a parcel of land (the Land the Company purchased in Taiwan. The Lenders also agreed to an earlier closing
of up to of the principal amounts of the Loans upon the Company s request prior to the time that title to the Land is vested
in the Company s subsidiary, Aerkomm Taiwan, to pay the outstanding payable to the Company s vendors. On April 25, 2022, the
Lenders further amended the commitment and agreed to increase the percentage of earlier closing amount from to , thus making the
full million of the Loan Commitments available to the Company. 

In addition to the foregoing, on March
1, 2023 we entered into a letter agreement with Well Thrive Limited, one of the lenders under the Loan Commitment, in which it was agreed
that, to support the Company, one-half of the Loan Commitment amount of Well Thrive Limited (thus, would be funded (by Well
Thrive or by lenders arranged by Well Thrive) at no interest and with no fixed maturity date, with the remaining of Well Thrive
Limited s Loan Commitment to be funded on the basis of the originally agreed terms. As of December 31, 2023 and of September 30,
2024, from one of the Lenders under the Loan Commitment we did not have any loans and we had received Loans totaling NTD (New Taiwan Dollars)
 , recorded on our books as , from multiple individual lenders arranged by Well Thrive. 

In connection with the planned Merger
with IXAQ, the Company has obtained million in PIPE investment commitments and expects million in SAFE investments to be funded
before closing of the Merger. Further, the Company and IXAQ have entered into a letter agreement with Benchmark Company LLC Benchmark under which Benchmark has agreed to provide capital markets advisory services to the Company (including attaining research coverage, assisting
in road-shows and investor meetings and other advisory services) and to act as placement agent for the private placement of securities
by the Company. In connection with the arrangement with Benchmark, the Company is targeting the raise of million in connection with
the closing of and after the Merger, in addition to the million in already committed PIPE investment and up to approximately 
million of cash (net of transaction costs and depending on the amount of shareholder redemptions) contributed from the IXAQ side as a
result of the Merger. 

The Company also expects during 2025
to begin generating significant recurring revenues, including in connection with the OneWeb Distribution Partner Agreement entered into
between Aerkomm Japan, as Distribution Partner, and OneWeb on October 1, 2024, pursuant to which Aerkomm Japan was appointed as a distributor
for OneWeb in Japan and Taiwan and as reflected by the Company having made its first delivery of a certain classified radar system to
a governmental defense customer on October 24, 2024. 

With
our current available cash, a balance of of the million in aggregate loan commitments from the two Lenders still available,
 million in PIPE Investment commitments already signed concurrently to entering into the Merger Agreement with IXAQ and additional
amounts anticipated to be raised in SAFE financings and in connection with Benchmark relationship, the amount of any cash to be brought
into the merged Company by IXAQ in connection with the Merger (and depending on the amount of shareholder redemptions), the expected
ramp-up of revenue generating commercial sales, synergies expected to be obtained as a result of the planned merger of Aerkomm Taiwan
with its exclusive distributor for Taiwan, EJECTT, Inc., and carefully
managing hiring and other investments, the Company believes its working capital will be adequate to sustain the Company s operations
for the next twelve months. 

If the Merger does not close and thus
the million in PIPE commitments that are contingent on closing of the Merger are no longer committed, the Company expects to be able
to fund operations over the next 12 months from June 30, 2024 by short-term borrowings and other loan commitments, the balance of 
of the million in above-referenced loan commitments from two shareholders, renegotiating financing arrangements with some or all of
the committed PIPE investors (who are existing investors in the Company and have a strong interest in its success), slowing the pace of
hiring and other investments that the Company would otherwise undertake if the Merger closes, synergies and efficiencies from the planned
merger with EJECTT, and revenues received from the ramp-up of commercial sales. 

In conclusion, per the non-binding term
sheet agreement aforementioned, the Company will be able to fund the operations and development for the next 12 months.

Chairman of YuanJiu. On July 19, 2021, YuanJiu Inc. changed its name to EJECTT INC Ejectt ). 

As of September 30, 2024 and December
31, 2023, shares of Ejectt s common stock were pledged as collateral for debt obligations of the Company and booked under
long-term investment. These shares are pledged to Bank of Panhsin and Hsiao, Chia-Sung. Bank of Panhsin provides collateral for the issuance
of convertible bonds by U.S.-based Aerkomm Inc. Since the Company sold shares of the pledged shares and then later
acquired Ejectt shares once again, the Company used the average acquisition cost of NT per share to determine the value
of long-term investments as of September 30, 2024. 

On July 20, 2023, the Taipei Exchange
(the Exchange announced that the securities of Ejectt Inc. would be suspended from trading on the Exchange as of that date,
in accordance with Article 12-1 of the Business Rules of the Exchange due to significant changes in the scope of Ejectt s business
within a certain period before and after a change in control, that Ejectt s new business accounted for more than of its operations
and due to the dismissal of independent director, Lin Yi-Bin, due to issues of independence. The Company s management believes the
suspension will have no impact on the value of its investment in the Ejectt stock. The management understood that the Ejectt s management
intended to modify Ejectt s business such that its new business activities would constitute no more than of the business of
Ejectt, thereby enabling the resumption of trading in Ejectt conducting substantially the same business, as when its trading was suspended.
However, Ejectt s stock did not resume trading on the Exchange. 

On July 28, 2023, the Company and Ejectt
signed a non-binding letter of intent with respect to a possible merger between Aerkomm Taiwan Inc. and Ejectt. At a January 30, 2024
meeting of the shareholders of Aerkomm Taiwan, the shareholders approved pursuing a merger with Ejectt, under which Aerkomm Taiwan would
be the surviving company, and an offer of merger was delivered to Ejectt on February 1, 2024. On March 4, 2024, Ejectt was officially
delisted. 

Aerkomm Taiwan Inc. held a shareholders 
meeting on May 23, 2024 to approve the merger with Ejectt. On the same day, the Ejectt shareholders also approved the merger and the merger
agreement became effective as of that date. On May 27, 2024, Aerkomm Taiwan Inc. amended its articles of incorporation to increase its
capital. Aerkomm Taiwan and Ejectt agreed in the merger agreement to merge on June 27, 2024. However, for the merger to become legally
effective under Taiwanese law, it must be approved by the Department of Investment Review in Taiwan. An application for approval was submitted
on July 10, 2024. Aerkomm expects that the review process may require approximately 4-6 months. Aerkomm cannot assure whether the Department
of Investment Review will approve the transaction. 

As of September 30, 2024 and December
31, 2023, shares of Ejectt s common stock were restricted. 

As
 of September 30, 2024, through Aerkomm Taiwan and Aircom Telecom the Company held approximately

ITEM
2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 

The
Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations set forth in this Item 2 has been revised
to reflect the restatement occurring subsequent to the filing of the Original Form 10-Q, as well as to incorporate certain conforming
changes. 

The Company has restated, by means of its Annual
Report on Form 10-K/A for the year ended December 31, 2023 (the 2023 Form 10-K ), its consolidated balance sheet at December
31, 2023. For information on the impact of the restatement, reference is made to the Company s 2023 Form 10-K/A, (i) Part
I, Item 1A. Risk Factors; (ii) Part II, Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations; and (iii) Part II, Item 9A. Controls and Procedures. In addition, the restatement impacts the first quarter of 2024. The
restated amounts for the first quarter of 2024 are presented in the Company s Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q/A for the quarterly
period ended March 31, 2024. 

In the course of preparing its financial statements
for quarter ended September 30, 2024, our management and our audit committee concluded that it was appropriate to restate our previously
issued audited financial statements as of and for the period ended December 31, 2023. The restatement is to reflect a correction to the
Company s accounting for certain debt previously characterized as long-term debt, as short-term debt; due to the Company s
records indicating an intention to hold a certain investment for more than one year, the Company has reclassified that investment from
short-term to long-term and, consequently, the valuation method for this investment has been adjusted from market value (used for short-term
investments) to cost (used for long-term investments); a correction has been made to reclassify the account other receivable-related
party loans to short-term loan-others; the early redemption by our bond holders of our Credit Enhanced Zero Coupon Convertible
Bonds resulted in an early redemption loss and accrued default interest expenses. Although these changes are non-cash items and do not
change the Company s reported operating revenues or reported operating costs and expenses, the Company determined that these changes
have a material impact on the as filed financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023 and for the nine months period ended
September 30, 2024 (the Relevant Period ), and as a result, the restatement of the Relevant Periods is required. 

Throughout
the following Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Result of Operations, all referenced amounts for
prior periods and prior period comparisons reflect the balances and amounts on a restated basis.

Overview 

We are a
development stage innovative satellite communication technology company providing carrier-neutral and software-defined
infrastructure to deliver mission-critical, multi-orbit satellite broadband connectivity for the public and private sectors. For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, AERKOMM had 149,563 and 507,949 in revenues and net losses of 16,686,644 and
 13,422,441 . 

We offer a range of next-generation technologies
that bring high-throughput performance, interoperability and virtualization to provide high performance and resilient end-to-end broadband
connectivity to our customers in collaboration with satellite or constellation partners and mobile network operators. 

Because
we do not operate, or intend to operate, our own satellites or constellations, our business model remains asset-light and far less capital
intensive than most companies operating in the space industry. Instead, we are a value-added reseller of bandwidth where we provide value
both to our customers and to our partners be unlocking or otherwise expanding new use-cases for satellite communications, which also
means bringing new revenue streams to our satellite operator partners whose bandwidth we resell. 

While
we design and develop proprietary technologies, due to the complexity of the satellite communications industry, in order to deliver or
to architect end-to-end solutions, we also strategically source and integrate partner technologies to create robust and reliable satellite
networks that can be tailored to meet the demands of public and private sector clients. In order to enable resiliency and scalability,
we aim to be at the forefront of implementing virtualization for satellite communications through our software-defined approach, which
enhances flexibility, scalability, and efficiency, allowing for dynamic adaptation to evolving communication needs. By orchestrating
a comprehensive system of technologies, we endeavor to revolutionize satellite communication alongside our industry partners, delivering
unparalleled capabilities to empower industries and individuals worldwide. 

42 

Our
key proprietary cutting-edge technology is a universal terminal that we develop, which provides carrier-neutral satellite broadband access.
These terminals are designed to meet the diverse needs of users across various sectors, and connecting those users to the right satellite
in the sky, independent of which orbit it is located in, ensuring seamless connectivity and unparalleled performance. Our universal terminals
consist of both a multi-orbit flat panel antenna (FPA), or electronically steered array (ESA), as well as a carrier-neutral, software-defined
modem. Our groundbreaking glass semiconductor ESA antenna technology enhances performance by more than 50 in terms of throughput per
square inch, compared to other antenna designs and constructions. Our work on custom beamformer chips, or application specific integrated
circuits (ASICs), and on custom radiofrequency (RF) chipsets aims to optimize power and performance, enabling seamless connectivity across
multiple orbits. Within our modem, the software-defined radio (SDR) technology provides secure and agile signal transmission with military-grade
security features. Our work on a custom high-speed analog-to-digital (ADC) chipset aims to unlock hybrid-orbit links and to enable advanced
signal intelligence capabilities. 

As
of April 27, 2023, the Company has been awarded a regional satellite service spectrum usage permit. With this permit and our proprietary
technology, we believe that we will be able to develop and expand our revenue stream from satellite services. This positions us as not
only a hardware and system supplier, but also a value-added service and satellite service provider, and expands the markets in which
we can participate. 

As
a satellite service provider in Taiwan, we will be authorized to provide satellite services in the Civilian Telecommunications market,
such as for mobile backhaul, and Aerospace Defense markets, such as for both aviation and maritime applications. We expect these
capabilities also to enable us to secure network resiliency contracts. 

Moving
forward, the Company intends to pursue initiatives in the Aerospace Defense and Civilian Telecommunications markets to establish
a leading position as innovators at the forefront of the booming satellite communications industry. We are primed to capitalize on the
opportunities presented by the rapidly evolving satellite communication landscape, driving innovation and delivering value to customers
and stakeholders. 

U.S.
Budget Environment 

With
the largest defense budget in the world, U.S. Government spending levels, particularly defense spending, and timely funding thereof can
affect our business prospects in the long term. While we do not yet have any contracts related to the U.S. Government s defense
spending at this time, to the extent that we can secure potential customers and contracts related to U.S. Government defense spending,
the U.S. Government defense budget, spending and timeline funding thereof may affect our business prospects in the medium term, as well. 

The
President s Fiscal Year (FY) 2024 budget request was submitted to Congress on March 9, 2023, initiating the FY 2024 defense authorization
and appropriations legislative process. The request included 886 billion for National Defense, of which 842 billion is for the Department
of Defense (DoD) base budget. 

On
June 3, 2023, the President signed H.R. 3746 The Fiscal Responsibility Act (FRA) into law. The legislation suspended the
debt ceiling until January 1, 2025, and, among other provisions, capped national defense spending at 886 billion for FY 2024 (President s
Budget Request level) and 895 billion for FY 2025. Supplemental funding legislation is not subject to the budget caps. If a continuing
resolution is enacted and still in effect and Congress does not pass all twelve defense and non-defense discretionary appropriations
bills by April 30, 2024, the FRA will result in a decrease in government spending for FY 2024 by one percent from FY 2023 enacted levels. 

The
House and Senate continue the legislative process on the FY 2024 budget. On December 22, 2023, the President signed the FY 2024 National
Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) into law. The NDAA authorizes funding at the FRA cap of 886 billion for National Defense. 

On
January 19, 2024, the President signed a continuing resolution that extends funding of four appropriations bills to March 1, 2024 and
the remaining eight to March 8, 2024. This will provide Congress additional time to enact all twelve FY 2024 appropriations bills based
on the overarching U.S. Government spending agreement reached by House and Senate leaders on January 7, 2024 which comports with the
FRA cap of 886 billion for National Defense in FY 2024. Overall, congressional sentiment remains strong for supporting the National
Defense Strategy and defense spending. However, the logistical and political challenges, especially in the U.S. House of Representatives,
are complex and add funding risk. 

43 

Under
the continuing resolution, funding at amounts consistent with appropriated levels for FY 2023 are available, subject to certain restrictions,
but new contract and program starts are not authorized. We expect our technologies and solutions are relevant both to current programs,
which may continue to be supported and funded under the continuing resolution, as well as to new programs, which are not yet authorized.
Regardless, during periods covered by continuing resolutions, we may experience challenges in securing contracts with prime contractors
to incorporate our products and services in their current programs, and those delays may adversely affect our ability to generate revenue
from new contracts. 

On
October 20, 2023, the President submitted a 106 billion supplemental funding request to Congress for assistance to Ukraine, Israel and
the IndoPacific; related U.S. restock of capacity transfers to Ukraine and Israel; and U.S. border security. Congress has not yet acted
on this request, which is part of the broader debate on FY 2024 U.S. Government funding and border security policy. Supplemental and
emergency funding are not subject to the FRA cap. If enacted, this would provide a partial relief valve for DoD funding limits under
the FRA or other limiting scenarios such as a prolonged continuing resolution. 

If
Congress is not able to enact FY 2024 appropriations bills or extend the continuing resolution, the U.S. Government will enter a whole
or partial shutdown. The impact of any government shutdown is uncertain. However, if a government shutdown were to occur and were to
continue for an extended period, we could be at risk of reduced opportunities to bid for and compete for, as the potential partners we
would be working with may experience reduce orders, program cancellations, schedule delays, production halts and other disruptions and
nonpayment, which could adversely affect our potential partners results of operations. Further, if any one of the 12 appropriations
bills is under a continuing resolution as of April 30, 2024, USG funding levels will reset to FY 2023 enacted levels minus 1 for the
remainder of FY 2024 or until all 12 appropriations are enacted. 

We
anticipate the federal budget will continue to be subject to debate and compromise shaped by, among other things, heightened political
tensions, the global security environment, inflationary pressures, and macroeconomic conditions. The result may be shifting funding priorities,
which could have material impacts on defense spending broadly and our potential partners programs. 

While
we do not yet generate revenue from programs funded by the U.S. Government, we aim to initiate and to continue discussions with our potential
partners and our potential customers to participate in contracts and in programs funded, in whole or in part, by the U.S. Government.
We cannot give any assurances at this time, however, that we will be able to successfully complete any of these discussions, or that
we will generate revenue from contracts or programs funded, in whole or in part, by the U.S. Government in the future. 

Geopolitical
and Economic Environment 

We
operate in a complex and evolving global security environment and our business is affected by geopolitical issues. Russia s invasion
of Ukraine significantly elevated global geopolitical tensions and security concerns resulting in increased interest for certain of our
products and services as countries seek to improve their security posture. In addition, security assistance provided by the U.S. Government
and its allies to Ukraine has created U.S. Government and allied demand to replenish U.S. stockpiles, resulting in additional and potential
future orders for our potential partners products, including for the ramp-up in production capacity for certain products. Although
many of our potential partners received new orders in 2024 attributable to a response to the conflict and continue to expect to receive
them over the next several years, given the long-cycle nature of our business and current industry capacity, the orders did not result
in a significant increase in 2024 sales as we do not yet have binding contracts with these potential partners. We aim to continue to
work with our potential partners and their supply chains to evaluate increases anticipated potential demand and enable us to position
our products and services to deliver critical capabilities to our potential partners and to their customers in the U.S. Government. 

Our
business and financial performance is also affected by general economic conditions. Supply chain disruptions persist, and although we
continue working to minimize the impact of supply chain challenges, many of these challenges are industry wide or caused by geopolitical
events that are outside of our control. In addition, heightened levels of inflation and the potential worsening of macro-economic conditions
present risks for our potential partners, our suppliers and the stability of the broader defense industrial base. Certain costs, including
rising labor rates and supplier costs, may increase as a result of inflation, and may put pressure on achieving our expected margins
in the future. If we continue to experience high rates of inflation, and we are unable to successfully mitigate the impact, our future
profits, margins and cash flows, may be adversely affected. Inflation and higher interest rates can also constrain the overall purchasing
power of our potential partners and their customers for our products and services potentially impacting future orders we aim to secure. 

44 

International
Business 

A
key component of our strategic plan is to grow our international sales. To accomplish this growth, we continue to focus on strengthening
our relationships internationally through partnerships and joint technology efforts. Our international business is primarily conducted
by direct commercial sales (DCS) to international customers, but in the future, we aim to engage it foreign military sales (FMS) contracted
through the U.S. Government, as well. In 2023, approximately 100 of our sales were DCS. Additionally, in 2023, substantially all of
our sales were in Aerospace Defense business segment to one international customer. Civilian Telecommunications sales from
international customers were not material in 2023. 

In
2023, international customers accounted for approximately 100 of the sales in the Aerospace Defense business segment as part of
a development contract we have been engaged with since 2021 to develop a first-of-its-kind satellite communications architecture for
unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) engaged in intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) missions with our development partner
and customer. By late 2023, our technology was tested and achieved positive results in operational environments. We anticipate starting
to deliver on our first major contract for this same customer in 2024. 

Commercial
Aviation Business Environment and Trends 

In
2023, global air traffic largely recovered to 2019 levels with domestic travel continuing to be the most robust and the single-aisle
market following closely. International travel has mostly recovered and the wide-body market continues to be paced by the international
travel recovery. The transition in the international commercial market from recovery to normal market conditions is progressing slowly
as China international travel remains below 2019 levels. Our potential aircraft manufacturing partners are experiencing strong demand
from their airline customers globally. 

Airline
financial performance, which influences demand for new capacity, has benefited from the resilient demand for travel. The International
Air Transport Association (IATA) is estimating 2023 industry-wide profit of 23.3 billion, up from its forecast of 4.6 billion a year
ago, primarily driven by North America, Europe and the Middle East. For 2024, IATA is forecasting 25.7 billion in profits for the industry
globally. The overall outlook continues to stabilize as we face uncertainties in the environment in the near- to medium-term as airlines
are facing persistently high and volatile cost of fuel and tight labor conditions. The global economy is expecting an easing of inflation
and interest rates, with regional economic and geopolitical difficulties adding uncertainty to the outlook and the financial viability
of some airlines and regions. 

The
long-term outlook for the commercial aviation industry remains positive due to the fundamental drivers of air travel demand: economic
growth, increasing propensity to travel due to increased trade, globalization and improved airline services driven by liberalization
of air traffic rights between countries. The commercial aviation industry remains vulnerable to exogenous developments including fuel
price spikes, credit market shocks, acts of terrorism, natural disasters, conflicts, epidemics, pandemics and increased global environmental
regulations. 

While
we do not yet generate revenue from contracts in the commercial aviation industry, we aim to initiate and to continue discussions with
our potential partners and our potential customers in the commercial aviation industry to provide our products and our services to such
potential partners and potential customers under binding and definitive contracts. We cannot give any assurances at this time, however,
that we will be able to successfully complete any of these discussions, or that we will generate revenue from contracts in the commercial
aviation industry in the future. 

45 

Civilian
Telecommunications Business Environment and Trends 

According
to GSMA s report The Mobile Economy 2023 , mobile connectivity continues to be a lifeline for society, helping the
most vulnerable people in areas affected by conflict and natural disasters to stay connected. It is also enabling advanced connectivity
capabilities needed by verticals to innovate amid diverse political, social and macroeconomic headwinds. 

By
the end of 2022, over 5.4 billion people globally subscribed to a mobile service, including 4.4 billion people who also used the mobile
internet. The mobile internet usage gap has narrowed markedly in the last five years - from 50 in 2017 to 41 in 2022 on average - but
still remains significant and demands urgent attention from all stakeholders. 

In
2022, mobile technologies and services generated 5 of global GDP, a contribution that amounted to 5.2 trillion of economic value added
and supported 28 million jobs across the wider mobile ecosystem. 5G will underpin future mobile innovation and services, building on
ongoing deployments and adoption. 

5G
adoption was projected to reach 17 in 2023, rising to 54 (equivalent to 5.3 billion connections) by 2030. The technology will add almost
 1 trillion to the global economy in 2030, with benefits spread across all industries. 

While
we do not yet generate revenue from contracts in the civilian telecommunications industry, we aim to initiate and to continue discussions
with our potential partners and our potential customers in the civilian telecommunications industry to provide our products and our services
to such potential partners and potential customers under binding and definitive contracts. We cannot give any assurances at this time,
however, that we will be able to successfully complete any of these discussions, or that we will generate revenue from contracts in the
civilian telecommunications industry in the future. 

Principal
Factors Affecting Financial Performance 

We
believe that our operating and business performance will be driven by various factors that affect the Aerospace Defense and Civilian
Telecommunications segments including the magnitude of defense spending by the U.S. and its allies, trends in air travel affecting the
commercial airline industry, and trends in the evolution of the digital infrastructure and technologies deployed by mobile network operators,
which collectively constitute the customer bases that we target, as well as general macroeconomic factors. Key factors that may affect
our future performance include: 

our
 ability to enter into and maintain long-term business arrangements with potential partners that are defense contractors and other
 potential military and government customers, which depends on numerous factors including the real or perceived availability, quality
 and price of our services and product offerings as compared to those offered by our competitors; 

our
 ability to enter into and maintain long-term business arrangements with potential partners in the commercial aviation and airline
 industries and other potential aerospace customers, which depends on numerous factors including the real or perceived availability,
 quality and price of our services and product offerings as compared to those offered by our competitors; 

our
 ability to enter into and maintain long-term business arrangements with potential partners in civilian telecommunications industries
 and other potential telecommunications customers, which depends on numerous factors including the real or perceived availability,
 quality and price of our services and product offerings as compared to those offered by our competitors; 

our
 ability to enter into and maintain long-term business arrangements with potential partners in satellite communications industries,
 including satellite and constellation operators with satellites in various orbits such as LEO, MEO, GEO and HEO, which depends on
 numerous factors including the technical integration of our technology and services with their satellites and core networks; 

our
 ability to secure and maintain the relevant licenses and regulatory approvals to operate as a distribution partner of satellite bandwidth
 from our current and potential satellite and constellation partners in our potential target countries and regions, which depends
 on numerous factors including the navigation of both national and international regulatory regimes and coordination with ministries
 of communications or their equivalent; 

46 

our
 ability to secure and maintain the relevant type approvals, as necessary, to install our universal terminals on airborne, maritime
 and land-based vehicles and platforms, such as the DO-160 certification for installation of our systems on aircraft, which depends
 on numerous factors including the navigation of both governmental and third-party regulatory regimes and coordination with key stakeholders; 

the
 extent of the adoption of our products and services by potential Aerospace Defense and Civilian Telecommunications partners
 and customers; 

costs
 associated with implementing, and our ability to implement on a timely basis, our technology, upgrades and installation technologies; 

costs
 associated with and our ability to execute our expansion, including modification to our network to accommodate satellite technology,
 development and implementation of new satellite-based technologies, the availability of satellite capacity, costs of satellite capacity
 to which we may have to commit well in advance, and compliance with regulations; 

costs
 associated with managing a rapidly growing company; 

the
 number of manned and unmanned defense platforms in service in our markets, including changes in fleet size by one or more of our
 potential military or government customers; 

the
 geopolitical environment and other trends that affect defense spending; 

continued
 demand for connectivity and proliferation of manned and unmanned defense platforms, including UAVs and drones; 

the
 number of aircraft in service in our markets, including consolidation of the airline industry or changes in fleet size by one or
 more of our commercial airline partners; 

the
 economic environment and other trends that affect both business and leisure travel; 

the
 number of cell towers, base stations and antennas deployed by mobile network operators and
 digital infrastructure developers in our markets, including consolidation of the telecommunications
 industry or changes in network topology due to transitions from 4G to 5G and, eventually
 to 6G mobile networks by one or more of our potential civilian telecommunications partners; 

continued
 demand for connectivity and proliferation of Wi-Fi enabled devices, including smartphones, tablets and laptops; 

our
 ability to obtain required licenses and approvals necessary for our operations; and 

changes
 in laws, regulations and interpretations affecting telecommunications services and aviation, including, in particular, changes that
 impact the design of our equipment and our ability to obtain required certifications for our equipment.

Ground-based Satellite System Sales 

Since our acquisition of Aircom Taiwan in December
2017, this wholly owned subsidiary has been developing ground-based satellite connectivity components which have an application in remote
regions that lack regular affordable ground-based communications. In September 2018, Aircom Taiwan consummated its first sale of such
a component, a small cell server terminal, in the amount of 1,730,000. This server terminal will be utilized by the purchaser in
the construction of a satellite-based ground communication system which will act as a multicast service extension of existing networks.
The system is designed to extend local existing networks, such as ISPs and mobile operators, into rural areas and create better coverage
and affordable connectivity in these areas. Aircom Taiwan expects to sell additional satellite connectivity components, systems and services
to be used in ground mobile units in the future, although there can be no assurances that it will be successful in these endeavors. 

In addition, in September 2018, Aircom Taiwan
provided installation and testing services of a satellite-based ground connectivity system to a remote island resort and received service
income related to this project in the amount of 15,000. Upon the completion of this system s testing phase, and assuming that the
system operates satisfactorily, Aircom Taiwan expects to begin to sell this system to multiple, remotely located resorts. We can make
no assurances at this time however, that this system will operate satisfactorily, that we will be successful in introducing this system
as a viable product offering or that we will be able to generate any additional revenue from the sale and deployment of this system.

Planned Merger with Ejectt 

On July 28, 2023, we and Ejectt, Inc. signed
a non-binding letter of intent with respect to a possible merger between Aerkomm Taiwan and Ejectt. At a January 30, 2024 meeting of
the shareholders of Aerkomm Taiwan, the shareholders approved pursuing a merger with Ejectt, under which Aerkomm Taiwan would be the
surviving company, and delivery of a notice and merger contract to Ejectt, which were delivered to Ejectt on February 1, 2024. At a May

agreement was then signed by the parties on May 23, 2024. Under the merger agreement and contingent only
 on the merger s receiving necessary governmental approvals, the merger will be consummated
and the surviving company of the merger will be Aerkomm Taiwan. 

Because Aerkomm Taiwan has foreign
(non-Taiwanese) shareholders (Aerkomm holds 49 of the outstanding shares of Aerkomm Taiwan) for the merger to become legally
effective under Taiwanese law, it must be approved by the Taiwan Department of Investment Review. Aerkomm and Ejectt submitted an
application to the Department of Investment Review on July 10, 2024. Reviews by the Department of Investment Review often take four
to six months and possibly longer, may require extensive inquiries and requests for further information by the Department of
Investment Review, and sometimes result in denial of approval. Consequently, Aerkomm cannot assure that the merger will be approved
or, if approved, when the approval may be granted.

Principal Factors Affecting Financial Performance 

We believe that our operating and business performance
will be driven by various factors that affect the commercial airline industry, including trends affecting the travel industry and trends
affecting the customer bases that we target, as well as factors that affect wireless Internet service providers and general macroeconomic
factors. Key factors that may affect our future performance include: 

our ability to enter into and maintain long-term business arrangements with airline partners, which depends on numerous factors including the real or perceived availability, quality and price of our services and product offerings as compared to those offered by our competitors; 

the extent of the adoption of our products and services by airline partners and customers; 

costs associated with implementing, and our ability to implement on a timely basis, our technology, upgrades and installation technologies; 

costs associated with and our ability to execute our expansion, including modification to our network to accommodate satellite technology, development and implementation of new satellite-based technologies, the availability of satellite capacity, costs of satellite capacity to which we may have to commit well in advance, and compliance with regulations; 

costs associated with managing a rapidly growing company; 

the impact and aftereffects of the global coronavirus (COVID-19)
pandemic, and other potential pandemics or contagious diseases or fear of such outbreaks, on the global airline and tourist industries,
especially in the Asia Pacific region; 

the number of aircraft in service in our markets, including consolidation of the airline industry or changes in fleet size by one or more of our commercial airline partners; 

the economic environment and other trends that affect both business and leisure travel; 

continued demand for connectivity and proliferation of Wi-Fi enabled devices, including smartphones, tablets and laptops; 

our ability to obtain required telecommunications, aviation and other licenses and approvals necessary for our operations; and 

changes in laws, regulations and interpretations affecting telecommunications services and aviation, including, in particular, changes that impact the design of our equipment and our ability to obtain required certifications for our equipment.

Smaller Reporting Company 

Although we no longer qualify as an Emerging Growth
Company, or EGC, we continue to qualify as a smaller reporting company, which allows us to take advantage of many of the same exemptions
from disclosure requirements, including reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation that are available to an EGC.
In addition, as a smaller reporting company with less than 100 million in annual revenue, we are not required to comply with the auditor
attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. In reliance on these exemptions, we have taken advantage of
reduced reporting obligations in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q. 

Recent Market Information 

The IATA (International Air Transport Association)
in August 2023 issued the report entitled Passenger Market Analysis. 

Industry-wide revenue passenger-kilometers (RPKs) increased 28.4 year-on-year (YoY) in August. Compared to 2019 levels, passenger traffic recovered to 95.7 . 

Available seat-kilometers (ASKs) rose at a slower annual pace of 24.9 , lifting passenger load factors (PLFs) close to pre-pandemic levels. The PLF in August was 84.6 , 1.1 ppts lower than the PLF for the same month in 2019. 

Domestic passenger traffic grew 9.2 over pre-pandemic levels. Most monitored markets saw stable growth in domestic traffic, while Japan experienced disruptions due to Typhoon Khanun. 

The recovery of international RPKs remained at 88.5 of 2019 levels. Regions experienced different outcomes while Asia Pacific carriers continued to restore international traffic. 

Ticket sales data signaled unwinding domestic demand while international bookings remained on the same positive trend. 

Passenger traffic expanded further in August 2023,
with industry-wide revenue passenger kilometers (RPKs) growing 28.4 year-on0year (YoY) and reaching 95.7 of August 2019 levels. In seasonally-adjusted
terms, passenger traffic increased 1.0 month-on-month (MoM), indicating a slowing but still positive trend globally.

on the Bonds as of that date. We expect to repay the remaining balance of the amount of 2,391,092 owed on the bonds, plus any additional
accrued interest, within the next few months. 

53 

Capital Expenditures 

Our operations continue to require significant
capital expenditures primarily for technology development, equipment and capacity expansion. Capital expenditures are associated with
the supply of airborne equipment to our prospective airline partners, which correlates directly to the roll out and/or upgrade of service
to our prospective airline partners fleets. Capital spending is also associated with the expansion of our network, ground stations
and data centers and includes design, permitting, network equipment and installation costs. 

Capital expenditures for the nine months ended
September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 394,100 and 379,128, respectively. 

We anticipate an increase in capital spending
in fiscal year 2024 and estimate that capital expenditures will range from 3 million to 10 million as we will continue to advance our
semiconductor designs, our software-defined platforms and continue to execute our network expansion strategy. We expect to be able to
raise these required funds in connection with our planned Merger with IXAQ although we cannot provide assurance that we will be successful
in this effort. 

Inflation 

Inflation and changing prices have not had a
material effect on our business, and we do not expect that inflation or changing prices will materially affect our business in the foreseeable
future. However, our management will closely monitor price changes in our industry and continually maintain effective cost control in
operations. 

Off Balance Sheet Arrangements 

We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements
that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues
or expenses, results of operations, liquidity or capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to an investor in our securities. 

Seasonality 

Our operating results and operating cash flows
historically have not been subject to significant seasonal variations. This pattern may change, however, as a result of new market opportunities
or new product introductions. 

54 

Critical Accounting Policies 

The preparation of financial statements in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires our management to make assumptions, estimates and judgments
that affect the amounts reported, including the notes thereto, and related disclosures of commitments and contingencies, if any. We have
identified certain accounting policies that are significant to the preparation of our financial statements. These accounting policies
are important for an understanding of our financial condition and results of operation. Critical accounting policies are those that are
most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require management s difficult, subjective,
or complex judgment, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may
change in subsequent periods. Certain accounting estimates are particularly sensitive because of their significance to financial statements
and because of the possibility that future events affecting the estimate may differ significantly from management s current judgments.
We believe the following critical accounting policies involve the most significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of
our financial statements: 

Concentrations of Credit Risk. Financial
instruments that potentially subject to significant concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash in banks. As of September
30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the total balance of cash in bank exceeding the amount insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation
(FDIC) for the Company was approximately 0 and 0, respectively. The balance of cash deposited in foreign financial institutions exceeding
the amount insured by local insurance is approximately 35,000 and 7,246,000 as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.
We perform ongoing credit evaluation of its customers and requires no collateral. An allowance for doubtful accounts is provided based
on a review of the collectability of accounts receivable. We determine the amount of allowance for doubtful accounts by examining its
historical collection experience and current trends in the credit quality of its customers as well as its internal credit policies. Actual
credit losses may differ from our estimates. 

Inventories . Inventories are recorded
at the lower of weighted-average cost or net realizable value. We assess the impact of changing technology on our inventory on hand and
writes off inventories that are considered obsolete. 

Research and Development Costs .
Research and development costs are charged to operating expenses as incurred. For the nine months periods ended September 30, 2024 and
2023, we incurred approximately 12,213 and 1,271,651 of research and development costs, respectively. 

Property and Equipment . Property
and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. When value impairment is determined, the related assets are stated at
the lower of fair value or book value. Significant additions, renewals and betterments are capitalized. Maintenance and repairs are expensed
as incurred. Depreciation is computed by using the straight-line and double declining method over the following estimated service lives:
computer equipment - 3 to 5 years, furniture and fixtures - 5 years, satellite equipment - 5 years, vehicles 5 to 6 years and
lease improvement - 5 years. Construction costs for on-flight entertainment equipment not yet in service are recorded under construction
in progress. Upon sale or disposal of property and equipment, the related cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the corresponding
accounts, with any gain or loss credited or charged to income in the period of sale or disposal. We review the carrying amount of property
and equipment for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable.
We determined that there was no impairment loss for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 

55 

Right-of-Use Asset and Lease Liability.
 In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) ASU 2016-02 ), which modifies
lease accounting for both lessees and lessors to increase transparency and comparability by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities
by lessees for those leases classified as operating leases and finance leases under previous accounting standards and disclosing key information
about leasing arrangements. A lessee should recognize the lease liability to make lease payments and the right-of-use asset representing
its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term. For operating leases and finance leases, a right-of-use asset and a lease liability
are initially measured at the present value of the lease payments by discount rates. The Company s lease discount rates are generally
based on its incremental borrowing rate, as the discount rates implicit in the Company s leases is readily determinable. Operating
leases are included in operating lease right-of-use assets and lease liabilities in the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets.
Finance leases are included in property and equipment and lease liability in our unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets. Lease
expense for operating expense payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Interest and amortization expenses
are recognized for finance leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term. For the leases with a term of twelve months or less, a
lessee is permitted to make an accounting policy election by class of underlying asset not to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities.
If a lessee makes this election, it should recognize lease expense for such leases generally on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
We adopted ASU 2016-02 effective January 1, 2019. 

Goodwill and Purchased Intangible Assets .
Goodwill represents the amount by which the total purchase price paid exceeded the estimated fair value of net assets acquired from acquisition
of subsidiaries. We test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis, or more often if events or circumstances indicate that there may
be impairment. 

As Aerkomm is currently still in the development
stage and will not start generating revenue until after late 2024. Management has evaluated that the potential benefits of the acquisitions
before the year 2023 are limited and uncertain, and due to this reason, management has decided to impair goodwill that generated from
2022 and prior periods with total of 4,561,037 in 2023. After the impair measurement, the net goodwill is 4,573,819. 

Purchased intangible assets with finite life are
amortized on the straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of respective assets. Purchased intangible assets with indefinite
life are evaluated for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be
recoverable. Purchased intangible asset consists of satellite system software and is amortized over 10 years. 

Fair Value of Financial Instruments .
We utilize the three-level valuation hierarchy for the recognition and disclosure of fair value measurements. The categorization of assets
and liabilities within this hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the measurement of fair value. The
three levels of the hierarchy consist of the following: 

Level 1 - Inputs to the valuation methodology
are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that we have the ability to access at the measurement
date. 

Level 2 - Inputs to the valuation methodology
are quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices in markets that are not active or inputs that are
observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the instrument. 

Level 3 - Inputs to the valuation methodology
are unobservable inputs based upon management s best estimate of inputs market participants could use in pricing the asset or liability
at the measurement date, including assumptions. 

The carrying amounts of the Company s cash
and restricted cash, accounts payable, short-term loan and other payable approximated their fair value due to the short-term nature of
these financial instruments. The Company s short-term investment and long-term investment are classified within Level 1 of the fair
value hierarchy on March 31, 2024. The Company s long-term bonds payable, long-term loan and lease payable approximated the carrying
amount as its interest rate is considered as approximate to the current rate for comparable loans and leases, respectively. There were
no outstanding derivative financial instruments as of September 30, 2024. 

Revenue Recognition . We recognize
revenue when performance obligations identified under the terms of contracts with our customers are satisfied, which generally occurs
upon the transfer of control in accordance with the contractual terms and conditions of the sale. Our revenue for the nine months ended
September 30, 2024 composed of the service income to one of our related parties. The majority of our revenue is recognized at a point
in time when product is shipped or service is provided to the customer. Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration we expect to
receive in exchange for transferring goods, which includes estimates for variable consideration. We adopted the provisions of ASU 2014-09
Revenue from Contract with Customers (Topic 606) and the principal versus agent guidance within the new revenue standard. As such, the
Company identifies a contract with a customer, identifies the performance obligations in the contract, determines the transaction price,
allocates the transaction price to each performance obligation in the contract and recognizes revenue when (or as) we satisfy a performance
obligation. Customers may make payments to the Company either in advance or in arrears. If payment is made in advance, the Company will
recognize a contract liability under prepayments from customers until which point the Company has satisfied the requisite performance
obligations to recognize revenue.

Income Taxes. Income taxes
are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are computed for differences between the financial
statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future based on enacted tax
laws and rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. Valuation allowances are established
when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized. Income tax expense is the tax payable or refundable
for the period plus or minus the change during the period in deferred tax assets and liabilities. Adjustments to prior period s
income tax liabilities are added to or deducted from the current period s tax provision. 

The Company follows FASB guidance on uncertain
tax positions and has analyzed its filing positions in all the federal, state and foreign jurisdictions where it is required to file income
tax returns, as well as all open tax years in those jurisdictions. The Company files income tax returns in the US federal, state and foreign
jurisdictions where it conducts business. It is not subject to income tax examinations by US federal, state and local tax authorities
for years before 2017. The Company believes that its income tax filing positions and deductions will be sustained on audit and does not
anticipate any adjustments that will result in a material adverse effect on its unaudited condensed consolidated financial position, results
of operations, or cash flows. Therefore, no reserves for uncertain tax positions have been recorded. The Company does not expect its unrecognized
tax benefits to change significantly over the next twelve months. 

The Company s policy for recording interest
and penalties associated with any uncertain tax positions is to record such items as a component of income before taxes. Penalties and
interest paid or received, if any, are recorded as part of other operating expenses in the unaudited condensed consolidated statement
of operations. 

Foreign Currency Transactions. Foreign
currency transactions are recorded in U.S. dollars at the exchange rates in effect when the transactions occur. Exchange gains or losses
derived from foreign currency transactions or monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognized in current
income. At the end of each period, assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are revalued at the prevailing exchange rates
with the resulting gains or losses recognized in income for the period. 

Translation Adjustments . If
a foreign subsidiary s functional currency is the local currency, translation adjustments will result from the process of translating
the subsidiary s financial statements into the reporting currency of our company. Such adjustments are accumulated and reported
under other comprehensive income (loss) as a separate component of stockholders equity. 

Earnings (Loss) Per Share. Basic
earnings (loss) per share is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of shares of
common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders
by the weighted-average number of shares of common outstanding during the period increased to include the number of additional shares
of common stock that would have been outstanding if the potentially dilutive securities had been issued. Potentially dilutive securities
include stock warrants and outstanding stock options, shares to be purchased by employees under the Company s employee stock purchase
plan. 

Subsequent
Events. The Company has evaluated events and transactions after the reported period up to November 12, 2024, the date on
which these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements were available to be issued. All subsequent events requiring recognition
as of September 30, 2024, have been included in these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements 

Simplifying the Accounting for Debt with Conversion and Other Options. 

In June 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06 to simplify
the accounting in ASC 470, Debt with Conversion and Other Options and ASC 815, Contracts in Equity s Own Entity. The guidance simplifies
the current guidance for convertible instruments and the derivatives scope exception for contracts in an entity s own equity. Additionally,
the amendments affect the diluted EPS calculation for instruments that may be settled in cash or shares and for convertible instruments.
This ASU became effective beginning in the first quarter of the Company s fiscal year 2023. The amendments in this update must be
applied on either full retrospective basis or modified retrospective basis through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings/(deficit)
in the period of adoption. Adoption of this standard did not have a material effect on the Company s operating results. 

Financial Instruments - Credit Losses 

In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial
Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments ASU 2016-13 ), which
modifies the measurement of expected credit losses of certain financial instruments. In March 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-02 and eliminate
the Troubled Debt Restructuring recognition and measurement guidance. 

The Company adopted the ASU on January 1, 2023
and the adoption of this standard did not have a material effect on the Company s operating results. 

Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes 

In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12
to simplify the accounting in ASC 740, Income Taxes. This guidance removes certain exceptions related to the approach for intra-period
tax allocation, the methodology for calculating income taxes in an interim period, and the recognition of deferred tax liabilities for
outside basis differences. This guidance also clarifies and simplifies other areas of ASC 740. This ASU will be effective beginning in
the first quarter of the Company s fiscal year 2021. Early adoption is permitted. Certain amendments in this update must be applied
on a prospective basis, certain amendments must be applied on a retrospective basis, and certain amendments must be applied on a modified
retrospective basis through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings/(deficit) in the period of adoption. The adoption of ASU
2019-12 did not have a significant impact on our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements as of and for the nine months period
ended September 30, 2024. 

Earnings Per Share 

In April 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-04, which included Topic 260
 Earnings Per Share . This guidance clarifies and reduces diversity in an issuer s accounting for modifications or exchanges
of freestanding equity-classified written call options due to a lack of explicit guidance in the FASB Codification. The ASU 2021-04 is
effective for all entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021. The adoption of ASU 2021-04 did not have a significant
impact on the Company s unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements as of and for the nine months ended September 30,
2024. 

Segment Reporting 

In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07,
which included Topic 280 Segment Reporting . This guidance improves reportable segment disclosure requirements primarily
through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. The ASU 2023-07 is effective for all entities for fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 2023. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting ASU 2023-07 on its unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements. 

Income Taxes 

In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09,
which included Topic 740 Income Taxes . This guidance requires business entities to disclose additional information related
to the income taxes. The ASU 2023-09 is effective for all entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. The Company is
currently evaluating the impact of adopting ASU 2023-09 on its unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. 

Not applicable. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures
(as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act). Disclosure controls and procedures refer to controls and other procedures designed
to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized
and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC and that such information is accumulated and communicated
to our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure. 

As required by Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange
Act, our management has carried out an evaluation, with the participation and under the supervision of our chief executive officer and
chief financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as of September 30,
2024. 

Based
upon, and as of the date of this evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer determined that, because of the material
weaknesses described in Item 9A Controls and Procedures of our Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the fiscal year ended December
31, 2023, filed with the SEC on September 5, 2024, and further referenced below, which we are still in the process of remediating as of
September 30, 2024 , our disclosure controls and procedures
were not effective. 

The Company restated its consolidated balance
sheet as of December 31, 2023 (the 2023 Restatement ). For a discussion of the individual restatement adjustments and the
impact of such adjustments on the Company s previously issued financial statements, see Item 1. Restated Financial Statements Note
2. Restatement of Previously Issued Financial Statements, above. 

Financial Statements Note 2. Restatement
of Previously Issued Financial Statements for Year Ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 in the Company s 2023 Form 10-K/A. Accordingly,
the Company is reporting in this Amendment No. 1 to its Form 10-Q/A for the quarterly period ended March 31, 2024, its most recent evaluation
of its disclosure controls and procedures which considered matters relating to the 2023 Restatement. 

As of March 31, 2024, the Company carried out
an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of its chief executive officer and chief financial officer, pursuant to
Rule 13a-15 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of its
disclosure controls and procedures. 

In making this evaluation, the Company has considered
matters relating to the 2023 Restatement including actions taken by the Company within the past year to identify and enhance the effectiveness
of its disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting. 

Based on this evaluation, the Company s
chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that as of the evaluation date, such disclosure controls and procedures
were reasonably designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports it files or submits under the Exchange
Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange
Commission. 

Other than as described above, since the evaluation
date by the Company s management of its internal controls, there have not been any significant changes in the internal controls
or in other factors that could significantly affect the internal controls. 

59 

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

We regularly review our system of internal control
over financial reporting and make changes to our processes and systems to improve controls and increase efficiency, while ensuring that
we maintain an effective internal control environment. Changes may include such activities as implementing new, more efficient systems,
consolidating activities, and migrating processes. 

During its evaluation of the effectiveness of
our internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2024, our management identified the following material weaknesses: 

We do not have sufficient and skilled accounting personnel with an appropriate level of technical accounting knowledge and experience in the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the United States commensurate with our financial reporting requirements. To mitigate the current limited resources and limited employees, we rely heavily on the use of external legal and accounting professionals. 

In order to cure the foregoing material weakness,
we have taken or plan to take the following remediation measures: 

As necessary, we will continue to engage consultants or outside accounting firms in order to ensure proper accounting for our consolidated financial statements. 

We intend to complete the remediation of the material
weakness discussed above as soon as practicable, but we can give no assurance that we will be able to do so. Designing and implementing
an effective disclosure controls and procedures is a continuous effort that requires us to anticipate and react to changes in our business
and the economic and regulatory environments and to devote significant resources to maintain a financial reporting system that adequately
satisfies our reporting obligations. The remedial measures that we have taken and intend to take may not fully address the material weakness
that we have identified, and material weaknesses in our disclosure controls and procedures may be identified in the future. Should we
discover such conditions, we intend to remediate them as soon as practicable. We are committed to taking appropriate steps for remediation,
as needed. 

All internal control systems, no matter how well
designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with
respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are
subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies
or procedures may deteriorate. 

Other than in connection with the implementation
of the remedial measures described above, there were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting during quarter ended
September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
