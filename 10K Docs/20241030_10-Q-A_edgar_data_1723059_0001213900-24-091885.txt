The Company incurred net losses of and from the Company s continuing operations for the three months ended June
30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The Company also had an accumulated deficit of from the company s continuing operations
as of June 30, 2024. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company
disposed non-profitable subsidiaries BEH and BEP, and is actively seeking other business opportunities including expanding OEM business
and looking for potential acquisition targets. Management also intends to raise funds by way of a private or public offering, or by obtaining
loans from banks or others. While the Company believes in the viability of its strategy to generate sufficient revenue and in its ability
to raise additional funds on reasonable terms and conditions, there can be no assurances to that effect. The ability of the Company to
continue as a going concern is dependent upon the Company s ability to further implement its business plan and generate sufficient
revenue and its ability to raise additional funds by way of a public or private offering. The financial statements do not include any
adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

the entire NOL can be carried forward up to 20 years.

purposes of million and million at June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. No tax benefit was reported

of the Company s net deferred tax assets for the NOL for both federal and California State of approximately million as
of June 30, 2024, was not considered more likely than not and accordingly, the potential tax benefits of the net loss carry-forwards are
fully offset by a full valuation allowance.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

Business Overview 

Bio Essence Corporation the Company 
or Bio Essence was incorporated in 2000 in the state of California. Fusion Diet Systems FDS was incorporated
in 2010 in the state of Utah. Bio Essence and FDS have been owned under common control since 2016. Bio Essence and FDS are mainly engaged
in manufacturing and distributing health supplement products. In January 2017, Bio Essence incorporated two subsidiaries in the state
of California: BEP and BEH, Bio Essence transferred its manufacturing operation into BEP, and transferred its distributing operation into
BEH. On March 1, 2017, the 100 shareholder of FDS transferred all her ownership in FDS into Bio Essence. On December 7, 2021, the Company
dissolved FDS. On November 12, 2021, Bio Essence incorporated a wholly owned subsidiary McBE Pharma Inc. McBE in the state
of California, McBE will be engaged in research and development and manufacture of prescription medicine. As a result of the ownership
restructure, BEP, BEH, and MCBE became wholly owned subsidiaries of Bio Essence, and Bio Essence serves as a holding corporation for these
subsidiaries. McBE has not engaged in any operations since its inception. On December 12, 2023, the Company entered into an agreement
with Newway Inc to sell the 100 equity ownership of BEP for 300,000. On March 28, 2024, the Company entered into an agreement with Health

The primary focus of BEP is producing products
for BEH, along with providing OEM services to other companies. BEH targets healthcare practitioners with herbal products in the form of
granules, capsules, pills and tablets. It also offers special formulation service to practitioners. The Company intends to develop the
subsidiary into an integrated healthcare platform that provides customers direct connections with integrative healthcare practitioners
such as dietitians, nutraceutical practitioners, and other practitioners in this discipline worldwide.

disruption of global financial markets, reducing the Company s ability to access capital, which could negatively affect the Company s
liquidity.

of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities
and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements as well as the reported net sales and
expenses during the reporting periods. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions. We base our estimates on historical
experience and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making
judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ
from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 

While our significant accounting policies are
more fully described in Note 2 to our CFS, we believe the following accounting policies are the most critical to assist you in fully understanding
and evaluating this management discussion and analysis. 

Basis of Presentation 

The accompanying consolidated financial statements CFS are prepared in conformity with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles US GAAP and applicable
rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC regarding interim financial reporting. The functional
currency of Bio Essence is U.S. dollars ). The accompanying financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars ). The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries, BEH (up
to disposal date), and McBE (up to dissolution date). All significant inter-company transactions and balances were eliminated in consolidation.

Going Concern 

The Company incurred net losses of 338,665 and
 116,507 from the company s continuing operations for the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The Company
incurred net losses of 215,678 and 93,443 from the company s continuing operations for the three months ended June 30, 2024 and
2023, respectively. The Company also had an accumulated deficit of 9,222,214 from the company s continuing operations as
of June 30, 2024. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company
plans to increase its income by strengthening its sales force, providing attractive sales incentive programs, and increasing marketing
and promotion activities. Management also intends to raise additional funds by way of a private or public offering, or by obtaining loans
from banks or others. While the Company believes in the viability of its strategy to generate sufficient revenue and in its ability to
raise additional funds on reasonable terms and conditions, there can be no assurances to that effect. The ability of the Company to continue
as a going concern is dependent upon the Company s ability to further implement its business plan and generate sufficient revenue
and its ability to raise additional funds by way of a public or private offering. The financial statements do not include any adjustments
that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

Use of Estimates 

In preparing financial statements in conformity
with US GAAP, management makes estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of
contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during
the reporting period. 

Significant estimates, required by management,
include the recoverability of long-lived assets, allowance for doubtful accounts, and the reserve for obsolete and slow-moving inventories.
Actual results could differ from those estimates. 

Accounts Receivable 

The Company s policy is to maintain an allowance
for potential credit losses on accounts receivable. Management reviews the composition of accounts receivable and analyzes historical
bad debts, customer concentrations, customer credit worthiness, current economic trends and changes in customer payment patterns to evaluate
the adequacy of these reserves. As of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there was no bad debt allowance . As of December 31, 2023,
the bad debt allowance from discontinued operations was 2,252. 

Revenue Recognition 

The Company recognizes revenues following the
five-step model prescribed under ASC 606: (i) identify contract(s) with a customer; (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract;
(iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (v) recognize
revenues when (or as) we satisfy the performance obligation. 

Revenue is measured at the amount of consideration
we expect to receive in exchange for the sale of our product, which occurs at a point in time, typically upon delivery to the customer.
The Company expenses incremental costs of obtaining a contract as and when incurred if the expected amortization period of the asset that
it would have recognized is one year or less or the amount is immaterial. 

Revenues from sales of goods are measured at net
of reserves established for applicable discounts and allowances that are offered within contracts with the Company s customers,
and are recognized when the goods are delivered to the customers. 

Product revenue reserves, which are classified
as a reduction in product revenues, are generally characterized in the following categories: discounts, returns and rebates. These reserves
are based on estimates of the amounts earned or to be claimed on the related sales and are classified as reductions of accounts receivable
as the amount is payable to the Company s customers. 

Revenues from manufacture services are recognized
when the manufacture process is completed pursuant to the customers requirement and the finished goods were delivered to the customers. 

The Company s return policy allows for the
return of damaged or defective products and shipment errors. A notice of damage or wrong items should make within five days from receiving
the goods, and actual return of the products must be completed within 30 days from the date of receiving the goods. Delayed notification
for damaged or wrong products will not be accepted for return or exchange. Custom formulas and capsules are not returnable. The amount
for return of products was immaterial for the six and three months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023.

Net cash used in operating activities for continuing
operations 

Net cash used in operating activities for
continuing operations was 19,563 for the six months ended June 30, 2024, compared to 124,731 in 2023. The decrease of cash
outflow of 105,168 from operating activities of continuing operations for the six months ended June 30, 2024 was principally attributable
to decreased cash outflow on security deposit by 100,545, decreased cash outflow on accounts payable by 56,563, decreased cash outflow
on accrued liabilities and other payables by 200,894. which was partly offset by increased cash outflow on accounts receivable by 7,888,
increased cash outflow on other receivables by 197,295, and increased cash outflow on payment of lease liabilities by 47,100. 

Net cash provided by financing activities for
continuing operations 

Net cash provided by financing activities for
continuing operations was 175,152 for the six months ended June 30, 2024, compared to 531,522 in 2023. The net cash provided by financing
activities for six months ended June 30, 2024 mainly consisted of proceeds of 185,200 loan from one major shareholder (also the senior
officer), partly offset by bank overdraft of 9,436, and payment of government loan of 612. The net cash provided by financing activities
for the six months ended June 30, 2023 consisted of proceeds of 532,111 from loan from one major shareholder (also the senior officer),
partly offset by payment of government loans of 589. 

Our current liabilities exceed current assets
at June 30, 2024, and we incurred substantial losses and cash outflows from operating activities in the periods presented. We may have
difficulty meeting upcoming cash requirements. As of June 30, 2024, our principal source of funds was loans from an officer (also is the
Company s major shareholder). As of June 30, 2024, we believe we will need 1.2 million cash to continue our current business for
the next 12 months. In addition to our continuous effort to improve our sales and net profits, we have explored and continue to explore
other options to provide additional financing to fund future operations as well as other possible courses of action. Such actions may
include, but are not limited to, securing lines of credit, sales of debt or equity securities (which may result in dilution to existing
shareholders), loans and cash advances from other third parties or banks, and other similar actions. There can be no assurance that we
will be able to obtain additional funding (if needed), on acceptable terms or at all, through a sale of our common stock, loans from financial
institutions, or other third parties, or any of the actions discussed above. If we cannot sustain profitable operations, and additional
capital is unavailable, lack of liquidity could have a material adverse effect on our business viability, financial position, results
of operations and cash flows.

Contractual Obligations 

Long-Term Debts 

Government loans 

In May and June 2020, BEH, BEP and FDS received
total of 215,600 from the Economic Injury Disaster Loan EIDL loan from the SBA after deducting 100 Uniform
Commercial Code UCC handling charge and filing fee for each company. This is a low-interest federal disaster loan for
working capital to small businesses and non-profit organizations of any size suffering substantial economic injury as a result of the
Coronavirus (COVID-19), to help the businesses to meet financial obligations and operating expenses that could have been met had the disaster
not occurred. This loan has interest of 3.75 and is not forgivable. The maturity of the loan is 30 years, installment payments including
principal and interest of 515 monthly will begin 12 months from the date of the promissory note. On March 4, 2022, The FDS
transferred its EIDL loan to BEC due to the dissolution of FDS. The SBA extended the deferment period to allow small businesses and not-for-profits
that received EIDL funds do not have to begin payments on the loan until 30 months after the date of the note. Accordingly, the company
began to make installment payments in the fourth quarter 2022. 

As of June 30, 2024, the future minimum EIDL loan
payments from the company s continuing operations to be paid by year are as follows:

The Company s Chief Executive Officer, Yin

controls and procedures means controls and other procedures of the Company (i) that are designed to ensure that information required
to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (15 U.S.C.
78a et seq. and hereinafter the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the
time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and (ii) include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure
that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated
and communicated to the Company s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing

26 

On June 30, 2024, Ms. Yan and Mr. Sluss reviewed

Report of Management 

Our management is responsible for establishing
and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting ICFR ), as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15. Our
ICFR is designed to provide reasonable assurance to our management and board of directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation
of published financial statements. Management conducted an assessment of our ICFR based on the framework and criteria established by
the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013).
Based on the assessment, management concluded that, as of June 30, 2024, our ICFR were not effective at the reasonable assurance level
based on those criteria. Management will continue to work to develop ICFR and controls over our reporting procedures. 

Our independent public accountant has not conducted
an audit of our controls and procedures regarding ICFR and therefore expresses no opinion with regards to the effectiveness or implementation
of our controls and procedures with regards to ICFR. 

Changes in Internal Controls over Financial
Reporting 

There were no changes in our ICFR identified in
connection with our evaluation of these controls as of the end of the quarter ending on June 30, 2024, as covered by this report that
has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our ICFR. 

Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls 

The Company s management does not expect
that its disclosure controls or its ICFR will prevent or detect all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed
and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system s objectives will be met. The design
of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative
to their costs. Further, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance
that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company
have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty and that breakdowns
can occur because of simple error or mistake. Controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of
two or more people, or management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions
about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under
all potential future conditions. Projections of any evaluation of controls effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks. Over
time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial
Reporting 

There were no changes in our internal control
over financial reporting during the quarter ending on June 30, 2023 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially
affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
