 Consumer Program Loans The Company originates a portion of its consumer loans using a third-party that sources and subsequently manages the portfolio of loans (the Consumer Program ). The Company has million and million of loans outstanding in the Consumer Program as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, or of our total gross loan portfolio as of each date. Loans in the Consumer Program are included within the Consumer Loan category disclosures in this footnote. As of March 31, 2024, of the loans were in a promotional period requiring no payment of interest on their loans with of these promotional loan periods ending in the second half of 2024 through the second quarter of 2025.

 million of promotional loans reached the end of the promotional period and began amortizing. See Item 2. Financial Condition Loans for more detailed information on the Consumer Program. Accrued Interest Receivable Accrued interest receivable on loans totaled million and million at March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, and is included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets. Nonaccrual and Past Due Loans Loans are considered past due if the required principal and interest payments have not been received as of the date such payments were due. Loans are placed on nonaccrual status when, in management s opinion, the borrower may be unable to meet payment obligations as they become due, as well as when required by regulatory provisions. In determining whether or not a borrower may be unable to meet payment obligations for each class of loans, we consider the borrower s debt service capacity through the analysis of current financial information, if available, and/or current information with regards to our collateral position. Regulatory provisions would typically require the placement of a loan on nonaccrual status if (i) principal or interest has been in default for a period of 90 days or more unless the loan is both well secured and in the process of collection or (ii) full payment of principal and interest is not expected. Loans may be placed on nonaccrual status regardless of whether or not such loans are considered past due. When interest accrual is discontinued, all unpaid accrued interest is reversed. Interest income on nonaccrual loans is recognized only to the extent that cash payments are received in excess of principal due. A loan may be returned to accrual status when all the principal and interest amounts contractually due are brought current and future principal and interest amounts contractually due are reasonably assured, which is typically evidenced by a sustained period (at least six months) of repayment performance by the borrower.

Modifications Provided to Borrowers Experiencing Financial Difficulty The Bank determines that a borrower may be experiencing financial difficulty if the borrower is currently delinquent on any of its debt, or if the Bank is concerned that the borrower may not be able to perform in accordance with the current terms of the loan agreement in the foreseeable future. Many aspects of the borrower s financial situation are assessed when determining whether they are experiencing financial difficulty, particularly as it relates to commercial borrowers due to the complex nature of the loan structure, business/industry risk and borrower/guarantor structures. Concessions may include the reduction of an interest rate at a rate lower than current market rates for a new loan with similar risk, extension of the maturity date, reduction of accrued interest, or principal forgiveness. When evaluating whether a concession has been granted, the Bank also considers whether the borrower has provided additional collateral or guarantors and whether such additions adequately compensate the Bank for the restructured terms, or if the revised terms are consistent with those currently being offered to new loan customers. The assessments of whether a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty at the time a concession has been granted is subjective in nature and management s judgment is required when determining whether the concession results in a modification that is accounted for as a new loan or a continuation of the existing loan under U.S. GAAP. Although each occurrence is unique to the borrower and is evaluated separately, for all portfolio segments, loans modified as a result of borrowers experiencing financial difficulty are typically modified through reductions in interest rates, reductions in payments, changing the payment terms from principal and interest to interest only, and/or extensions in term maturity. For the quarter-ended March 31, 2024, loan in the 1-4 family loan segment with an amortized cost basis of thousand, was modified to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty, representing less than of that loan segment. This loan was converted to an amortizing note, with a reduction in interest rate to fixed at from variable at . Two existing, other consumer loan modifications, with a total thousand in amortized cost and representing of this segment, have had no payment delinquencies in the first quarter of 2024. Of these two modifications, one loan with 

 16 

Table of Contents 
 thousand in amortized cost, was modified to interest only payments for eleven months, with a return to principal and interest payments in August 2024. Total contractual payments during the first quarter of 2024 for this loan prior to modification would have been . The other existing consumer loan, with thousand in amortized cost was modified to interest only payments for nine months, with principal and interest payments to resume in June 2024. Total contractual payments, prior to modification, for this quarter would have been . Residential 1-4 family Consumer loans Total The allowance for credit losses incorporates an estimate of lifetime expected credit losses and is recorded on each asset upon asset origination or acquisition. The starting point for the estimate of the allowance for credit losses is historical loss information, which includes losses from modifications of receivables to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty. Because the effect of most modifications made to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty is already included in the allowance for credit losses because of the measurement methodologies used to estimate the allowance, a change to the allowance for credit losses is generally not recorded upon modification. Occasionally, the Company modifies certain loans by providing principal forgiveness. When principal forgiveness is provided, the amortized cost basis of the loan is written off against the allowance. The amount of the principal forgiveness is deemed to be uncollectible; therefore, that portion of the loan is written off, resulting in a reduction of the amortized cost basis and a corresponding adjustment to the allowance for credit losses. If it is determined that a modified loan (or portion of a loan) has subsequently been deemed uncollectible, the loan (or a portion of the loan) is written off. At that time, the amortized cost basis of the loan is reduced by the uncollectible amount and the allowance for credit losses is adjusted by the same amount. Credit Quality Indicators Through its system of internal controls, Primis evaluates and segments loan portfolio credit quality using regulatory definitions for Special Mention, Substandard and Doubtful. Special Mention loans are considered to be criticized. Substandard and Doubtful loans are considered to be classified. Special Mention loans are loans that have a potential weakness that deserve management s close attention. If left uncorrected, these potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the loan or of the institution s credit position. Substandard loans may be inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged if any. Loans so classified have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt. They are characterized by the distinct possibility that the institution will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. Doubtful loans have all the weaknesses inherent in those classified as Substandard, with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, highly questionable or improbable. Primis had loans classified as Doubtful as of March 31, 2024 or December 31, 2023. In monitoring credit quality trends in the context of assessing the appropriate level of the allowance for credit losses on loans, we monitor portfolio credit quality by the weighted-average risk grade of each class of loan.

The recorded investment in consumer mortgage loans collateralized by residential real estate property that are in the process of foreclosure was million as of both March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Allowance For Credit Losses Loans The allowance for credit losses on loans is a contra-asset valuation account, calculated in accordance with ASC 326 that is deducted from the amortized cost basis of loans to present the net amount expected to be collected. The amount of the allowance represents management's best estimate of current expected credit losses on loans considering available information, from internal and external sources, relevant to assessing collectability over the loans' contractual terms, adjusted for expected prepayments when appropriate. In calculating the allowance for credit losses, most loans are segmented into pools based upon similar characteristics and risk profiles. For allowance modeling purposes, our loan pools include but are not limited to (i) commercial real estate - owner occupied, (ii) commercial real estate - non-owner occupied, (iii) construction and land development, (iv) commercial, (v) agricultural loans, (vi) residential 1-4 family and (vii) consumer loans. We periodically reassess each pool to ensure the loans within the pool continue to share similar characteristics and risk profiles and to determine whether

The IRLCs are adjusted for estimated costs to originate the loan as well as the probability that the mortgage loan will fund within the terms of the IRLC (the pullthrough rate). Estimated costs to originate include loan officer commissions and overrides. The pullthrough rate is estimated on changes in market conditions, loan stage, and actual borrower behavior using a historical analysis of IRLC closing rates. The Company obtains an analysis from a third party on a monthly basis to support the reasonableness of the pullthrough estimate. Best efforts and mandatory forward loan sale commitments are commitments to sell individual mortgage loans using both best efforts and mandatory delivery at a fixed price to an investor at a future date. Forward loan sale commitments that are mandatory delivery are accounted for as derivatives and carried at fair value, determined as the amount that would be necessary to settle the derivative financial instrument at the balance sheet date.

Our exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instruments for commitments to extend credit and letters of credit is based on the contractual amount of these instruments. We use the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as we do for on-balance sheet instruments. Unless noted otherwise, we do not require collateral or other security to support financial instruments with credit risk. Allowance For Credit Losses - Off-Balance-Sheet Credit Exposures The allowance for credit losses on off-balance sheet credit exposures is a liability account, calculated in accordance with ASC 326, representing expected credit losses over the contractual period for which we are exposed to credit risk resulting from a contractual obligation to extend credit. No allowance is recognized if we have the unconditional right to cancel the obligation. Off-balance sheet credit exposures primarily consist of amounts available under outstanding lines of credit and letters of credit detailed above. For the period of exposure, the estimate of expected credit losses considers both the likelihood that funding will occur and the amount expected to be funded over the estimated remaining life of the commitment or other off-balance sheet exposure. The likelihood and expected amount of funding are based on historical utilization rates. The amount of the allowance represents management's best estimate of expected credit losses on commitments expected to be funded over the contractual life of the commitment. Estimating credit losses on amounts expected to be funded uses the same methodology as described for loans in Note 3 - Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses, as if such commitments were funded. The allowance for credit losses on off-balance-sheet credit exposures is reflected in other liabilities in our condensed consolidated balance sheets.

 Current Economic Envir onment U.S. economic growth accelerated in the first quarter of 2024, with Real Gross Domestic Product growing by an annualized 1.6 . According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor and Statistics, the rate of unemployment was 3.8 in March 2024 and nonfarm payrolls grew at a robust pace. The Federal Reserve (the Fed raised interest rates 500 bps from May of 2022 through July of 2023, a pace that has not been experienced in more than 40 years, and sits at a range of 5.25 to 5.50 as of March 31, 2024. Inflation, while beginning to show signs of moderating, remains higher than the Fed s long term target rate of 2.0 and the Fed appears committed to maintaining high rates until inflation is back at their target rate. The Fed has indicated that future rate adjustments will be data-dependent. This higher rate environment is continuing to put strong margin pressure on all banks, including Primis, as the cost of deposits has increased alongside the Fed rate increases while many loans in banks portfolios are fixed due to borrowers locking in historic low rates in the past few years. However, loan growth in the current environment will benefit from the higher rates and should assist in partially offsetting growth in deposit costs. FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS Net income available to our common shareholders for the three months ended March 31, 2024 totaled 2.5 million, or 0.10 basic and diluted earnings per share, compared to net income of 8.4 million, or 0.34 basic and diluted earnings per share for the three months ended March 31, 2023. Total assets as of March 31, 2024 were 3.9 billion, an increase of 1 compared to December 31, 2023. Total loans as of March 31, 2024, were 3.2 billion, generally flat compared to December 31, 2023. Total deposits were 3.3 billion at March 31, 2024, an increase of 1 compared to December 31, 2023. Non-time deposits increased to 2.9 billion at March 31, 2024, an increase of 67.9 million, or 2 , compared to December 31, 2023. The ratio of gross loans to deposits declined to 95.8 at March 31, 2024, from 96.9 at December 31, 2023. Net interest margin of 2.84 in the first quarter of 2024 was up from 2.81 in the first quarter of 2023 and down from 2.86 in the fourth quarter of 2023. Allowance for credit losses to total loans was 1.66 at March 31, 2024, compared to 1.62 at December 31, 2023. Noninterest expense of 27.5 million in the first quarter of 2024 was up 0.6 million compared to the first quarter of 2023 but declined 0.7 million from the fourth quarter of 2023. Asset quality remained steady from year end with nonperforming assets as a percent of total assets (excluding SBA guarantees) at 0.23 at March 31, 2024 compared to 0.20 at December 31, 2023. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Net Income Net income for the three months ended March 31, 2024 totaled 2.5 million, or 0.10 basic and diluted earnings per share, compared to net income of 8.4 million, or 0.34 basic and diluted earnings per share for the three months ended March 31, 2023. The 71 decrease in net income during the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2023 was driven primarily by a decrease in derivative gains of 9.4 million, an increase in credit loss provisions of 1.2 million, and personnel expenses of 0.7 million, partially offset by an increase in mortgage banking income of 1.3 million, increases in all other noninterest income categories of 2.0 million, and a decrease in income tax provision of 1.7 million. Net Interest Income Our operating results depend primarily on our net interest income, which is the difference between interest and dividend income on interest-earning assets such as loans and investments, and interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities such as deposits and borrowings.

The yield on average interest-earning assets was 5.65 and 4.92 for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Increase in yield on average interest-earnings assets was driven by a 71 basis point increase on loans in the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2023. The cost of average interest-bearing deposits increased 96 basis points to 3.28 for the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to 2.32 for the three months ended March 31, 2023, as average interest-bearing liabilities grew approximately 0.2 billion and the rates paid on these liabilities grew significantly due to the consistent increases in benchmark interest rates during 2023. The increase was driven by higher costs in every interest-bearing deposit category with the largest driver being an increase in average savings deposits of 206.4 million with an average increase in cost of those deposits of 80 basis points. This increase was primarily a result of the growth of the digital deposit platform during 2023 and increase in benchmark interest rates. Average loans during the three months ended March 31, 2024 were 3.2 billion, compared to 3.0 billion during the three months ended March 31, 2023. The 0.2 billion increase in average loans combined with the 71 basis point increase in yield on the loan portfolio drove the 9.3 million increase in income on loans. The following table details average balances of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, the amount of interest earned/paid on such assets and liabilities, and the yield/rate for the periods indicated:

 Provision for Credit Losses The provision for credit losses is a current charge to earnings made in order to adjust the allowance for credit losses for current expected losses in the loan portfolio based on an evaluation of the loan portfolio characteristics, current economic conditions, changes in the nature and volume of lending, historical loan experience and other known internal and external factors affecting loan collectability, and assessment of reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions that would impact collectability of the loans. Our allowance for credit losses is calculated by segmenting the loan portfolio by loan type and applying risk factors to each segment. The risk factors are determined by considering historical loss data, peer data, as well as applying management s judgment. The Company recorded a provision for credit losses for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, of 6.5 million and 5.3 million, respectively. The provision included amounts calculated in our normal reserve process for the Consumer Program loans which totaled 4.9 million and 4.7 million during the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Our provision for credit losses was driven by provisions related to the Consumer Program loan portfolio primarily centered around loans originated from the third quarter of 2022 through the first quarter of 2023. Excluding the provision amounts related to the Consumer Program portfolio, we recorded a provision for credit losses of 1.6 million and 0.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. We had net charge-offs totaling 5.3 million and 4.0 million during the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. During the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, 4.3 million and 1.9 million, respectively, of net charge-offs were related to the Consumer Program loans. These charge-offs were primarily related to loans originated from the third quarter of 2022 to the first quarter of 2023. Excluding the Consumer Program loan charge-offs we had net charge-offs of 1.0 million and 2.1 million during the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The Financial Condition section of this MD A provides information on our loan portfolio, past due loans, nonperforming assets and the allowance for credit losses. Noninterest Income The following table presents the major categories of noninterest income for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023: 

For the Three Months Ended March 31, (dollars in thousands) 2024 2023 Change Account maintenance and deposit service fees 1,393 1,224 169 Income from bank-owned life insurance 564 420 144 Mortgage banking income 5,574 4,315 1,259 Gain on sale of loans 336 51 285 Gain (loss) on other investments 206 (39) 245 Consumer Program derivative 2,041 11,443 (9,402) Other noninterest income 193 256 (63) Total noninterest income 10,307 17,670 (7,363) Noninterest income decreased 42 to 10.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to 17.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023. The decrease in noninterest income was primarily related to a decline in the Consumer Program derivative income of 9.4 million during the three months ended March 31, 2024. This decline was driven by 10.5 million of fair value gains on the derivative in the prior year compared to a 0.1 million loss in the current year, partially offset by 1.0 million of additional income under the Consumer Program agreement in the current

Table of Contents 
 year compared to the prior year. The fair value gain in the prior year was driven primarily by higher expected cash flows related to a significant increase in promotional interest loans in the Consumer Program portfolio and higher credit losses in the same portfolio resulting in less expected payments owed by us to the counterparty, which did not re-occur in the current year. The decrease in noninterest income driven by the Consumer Program derivative was partially offset by 1.3 million of higher mortgage banking income due to growth in the mortgage banking business. Noninterest Expense The following table presents the major categories of noninterest expense for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023: 

For the Three Months Ended March 31, (dollars in thousands) 2024 2023 Change Salaries and benefits 15,735 15,028 707 Occupancy expenses 1,490 1,445 45 Furniture and equipment expenses 1,616 1,577 39 Amortization of core deposit intangible 317 317 Virginia franchise tax expense 631 849 (218) FDIC insurance assessment 610 364 246 Data processing expense 2,231 2,251 (20) Marketing expense 459 569 (110) Telephone and communication expense 346 377 (31) Professional fees 1,365 862 503 Miscellaneous lending expenses 451 885 (434) Other operating expenses 2,287 2,430 (143) Total noninterest expenses 27,538 26,954 584 Noninterest expenses were 27.5 million during the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to 27.0 million during the three months ended March 31, 2023. The 2 increase in noninterest expenses was primarily related to a 0.7 million increase in employee compensation and benefits expense and 0.5 million increase in professional fees. The increase in salaries and benefits expense related to increased head count at the Bank that was driven by the Panacea Financial division and Primis Mortgage during the to the first quarter of 2024 compared to the first quarter of 2023. The increase in professional fees expense was driven by higher attorney costs and expenses related to our annual financial audit. The noninterest expense increase was partially offset by decreases in miscellaneous lending expenses and lower franchise tax expense. The miscellaneous lending expense decline was driven by lower collection expenses due to improving credit quality in the loan portfolio and also due to less servicing expenses on the Consumer Program portfolio. The franchise tax declined as a result of a lower assessment base in the current year compared to the prior year.

As of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, a majority of our loans were to customers located in Virginia and Maryland. We are not dependent on any single customer or group of customers whose insolvency would have a material adverse effect on our operations. Our loan portfolio grew 0.1 in the first quarter of 2024 which included declines in real estate secured loans and increases in commercial and consumer loans. The consumer loan growth was primarily driven by the increase in life insurance premium finance loans followed by originations in the Consumer Program portfolio during the first quarter of 2024. The increase in commercial loans was driven primarily by commercial loan growth in our Panacea Financial division, which are diversified geographically and are spread across the nation. The composition of our loans held for investment portfolio consisted of the following as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 (in thousands):

 Asset Quality; Past Due Loans and Nonperforming Assets The following table presents a comparison of nonperforming assets as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 (in thousands): 

March 31, December 31, 2024 2023 Nonaccrual loans 10,139 9,095 Loans past due 90 days and accruing interest 1,714 1,714 Total nonperforming assets 11,853 10,809 SBA guaranteed amounts included in nonperforming loans 3,095 3,115 Allowance for credit losses to total loans 1.66 1.62 Allowance for credit losses to nonaccrual loans 527.22 574.06 Allowance for credit losses to nonperforming loans 451.00 483.04 Nonaccrual to total loans 0.32 0.28 Nonperforming assets excluding SBA guaranteed loans to total assets 0.23 0.20 Asset quality remained relatively stable during the first quarter of 2024 as noted in the table above. We will generally place a loan on nonaccrual status when it becomes 90 days past due. Loans will also be placed on nonaccrual status in cases where we are uncertain whether the borrower can satisfy the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Cash payments received while a loan is categorized as nonaccrual will be recorded as a reduction of principal as long as doubt exists as to future collections. We maintain appraisals on loans secured by real estate, particularly those categorized as nonperforming loans and potential problem loans. In instances where appraisals reflect reduced collateral values, we make an evaluation of the borrower s overall financial condition to determine the need, if any, for impairment or write-down to their fair values. If foreclosure occurs, we record OREO at the lower of our recorded investment in the loan or fair value less our estimated costs to sell. Our loan portfolio losses and delinquencies have been primarily limited by our underwriting standards and portfolio management practices. Whether losses and delinquencies in our portfolio will increase significantly depends upon the value of the real estate securing the loans and economic factors, such as the overall economy, rising or elevated interest rates, historically high or persistent inflation, and recessionary concerns. We originate a portion of our consumer loans (the Consumer Program) using a third party that sources and subsequently manages the portfolio of loans. As of March 31, 2024, the principal balance outstanding was 205.1 million. These loans are accounted for similar to our other consumer loans and are not placed on nonaccrual because they are charged off when they become 90 days past due. The allowance on this portfolio of loans was 23.0 million as of March 31, 2024 and represented 43 of our total allowance for credit losses. Net charge-offs on this portfolio were 4.3 million and 1.9 million during the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and represented approximately 82 and 47 , respectively, of net charge-offs recorded during the periods. The Company tightened its origination criteria in regard to this portfolio in April of 2023 and from that point forward we generally originated loans to consumer borrowers being managed by the third party with FICO scores over 720, whereas prior periods loan production included approximately 40 of loans to borrowers with weaker credit scores. This older vintage lower credit score portion of the portfolio has driven the uptick in related charge-offs during 2023 which continued into the first quarter of 2024 and necessitated the update of the Company s expected loss rates on this portfolio for purposes of determining the allowance for credit losses as discussed in the Provision for Credit Losses section of this MD A. The newer production represented approximately 29 of the portfolio at March 31, 2024 and is expected to improve the quality mix of the portfolio and result in lower realized net charge-offs in future periods.

 Investment Securities The following table sets forth a summary of the investment securities portfolio as of the dates indicated. Available-for-sale investment securities are reported at fair value, and held-to-maturity investment securities are reported at amortized cost (in thousands). 

March 31, December 31, 2024 2023 Available-for-sale investment securities: Residential government-sponsored mortgage-backed securities 93,319 96,808 Obligations of states and political subdivisions 29,869 30,080 Corporate securities 13,643 14,048 Collateralized loan obligations 5,008 4,982 Residential government-sponsored collateralized mortgage obligations 41,497 34,471 Government-sponsored agency securities 13,625 13,711 Agency commercial mortgage-backed securities 29,647 30,110 SBA pool securities 4,009 4,210 Total 230,617 228,420 Held-to-maturity investment securities: Residential government-sponsored mortgage-backed securities 8,714 9,040 Obligations of states and political subdivisions 2,067 2,391 Residential government-sponsored collateralized mortgage obligations 211 219 Total 10,992 11,650 Debt investment securities that we have the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified as held-to-maturity and carried at amortized cost. Investment securities classified as available-for-sale are those debt securities that may be sold in response to changes in interest rates, liquidity needs or other similar factors. Investment securities available-for-sale are carried at fair value, with unrealized gains or losses net of deferred taxes, included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders equity. Our portfolio of available-for-sale securities currently contains a material amount of unrealized mark-to-market adjustments due to increases in market interest rates since the original purchase of many of these securities. We intend to hold these securities until maturity or recovery of the value and do not anticipate realizing any losses on the investments. Investment securities, available-for-sale and held-to-maturity, totaled 241.6 million as of March 31, 2024, an increase of 0.6 from 240.1 million as of December 31, 2023, primarily due to purchases of available-for-sale securities, partially offset by paydowns, maturities, and calls of the investments over the past three months. We recognized an immaterial amount of credit impairment charges related to credit losses on our held-to-maturity investment securities during the three months ended March 31, 2023. No credit impairment charges were taken during the three months ended March 31, 2024. For additional information regarding investment securities refer to Note 2-Investment Securities in this Form 10-Q. Deposits and Other Borrowings Deposits The market for deposits is competitive. We offer a line of traditional deposit products that currently include noninterest-bearing and interest-bearing checking (or NOW accounts), commercial checking, money market accounts, savings accounts and certificates of deposit. We compete for deposits through our banking branches with competitive pricing, as well as nationally through advertising and online banking. We use deposits as a principal source of funding for our lending, purchasing of investment securities and for other business purposes. 

 45 

Table of Contents 
 The variety of deposit accounts we offer allows us to be competitive in obtaining funds and in responding to the threat of disintermediation (the flow of funds away from depository institutions such as banking institutions into direct investment vehicles such as government and corporate securities). Our ability to attract and maintain deposits, and the effect of such retention on our cost of funds, has been, and will continue to be, significantly affected by the general economy and market rates of interest. Total deposits were 3.3 billion as of March 31, 2024, a 1 increase from December 31, 2023. The increase in deposits from year end was primarily driven by growth in money market and savings accounts due to our competitive rates on these products. Savings accounts increased 5 from 783.8 million as of December 31, 2023 to 823.3 million as of March 31, 2024. Money market accounts also increased 5 from 794.5 million as of December 31, 2023 to 834.5 million as of March 31, 2024. Our deposits are diversified in type and by underlying customer and lack significant concentrations to any type of customer (i.e. commercial, consumer, government) or industry. Uninsured deposits are defined as the portion of deposit accounts in U.S. offices that exceed the FDIC insurance limit and amounts in any other uninsured investment or deposit account that are classified as deposits and are not subject to any federal or state deposit insurance regimes. Total uninsured deposits as calculated per regulatory guidance were 1.1 billion, or 34 of total deposits, at March 31, 2024. Other Borrowings We use other borrowed funds to support our liquidity needs and to temporarily satisfy our funding needs from increased loan demand and for other shorter term purposes. We are a member of the FHLB and are authorized to obtain advances from the FHLB from time to time as needed. The FHLB has a credit program for members with different maturities and interest rates, which may be fixed or variable. We are required to collateralize our borrowings from the FHLB with purchases of FHLB stock and other collateral acceptable to the FHLB. As of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, total FHLB borrowings were 25.0 million and 30.0 million, respectively. The decrease in FHLB borrowings was a result of the deposit growth during the first quarter of 2024 that primarily funded our loan growth and supported other funding needs. As of March 31, 2024, we had 478.5 million of unused and available FHLB lines of credit. Other borrowings can consist of federal funds purchased, secured borrowings due to failed loan sales, and securities sold under agreements to repurchase repo that mature within one year, which are secured transactions with customers. The balance in repo accounts at both March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was 3.0 million. We had secured borrowings of 21.3 million and 20.4 million as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, related to loan transfers to another financial institution during 2023 that did not meet the criteria to be treated as a sale under relevant accounting guidance. These borrowings reflect the cash received for transferring the loans to the other financial institution and any unamortized sale premium and are secured by approximately the same amount of loans held for investment that are recorded in our balance sheet. We retained the servicing of the loans that were transferred and accordingly receive principal and interest from the borrower as contractually required and transfer the interest to the other financial institution net of our contractually agreed upon servicing fee. The loans transferred have an average maturity of approximately ten years which will be the time over which the principal balance of the loans in our balance sheet and secured borrowings will pay down, absent borrower prepayments. During the three months ended March 31, 2024, additional advances were made to borrowers under the loans previously transferred in 2023 and were accordingly treated as additional secured borrowings as of March 31, 2024. For additional information on secured borrowings refer to Note 1 Accounting Policies in this Form 10-Q.

 Junior Subordinated Debt and Senior Subordinated Notes For information about junior subordinated debt and senior subordinated notes and their anticipated principal repayments refer to Note 7 Debt and Other Borrowings in this Form 10-Q. Liquidity and Funds Management The objective of our liquidity management is to ensure the ability to meet our financial obligations. These obligations include the payment of deposits on demand or at maturity, the repayment of borrowings at maturity and the ability to fund commitments and other new business opportunities. We obtain funding from a variety of sources, including customer deposit accounts, customer certificates of deposit and payments on our loans and investments. If our level of core deposits are not sufficient to fully fund our lending activities, we have access to funding from additional sources, including but not limited to borrowing from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta and institutional certificates of deposits. In addition, we maintain federal funds lines of credit with two correspondent banks, totaling 75 million, and utilize securities sold under agreements to repurchase and reverse repurchase agreement borrowings from approved securities dealers as needed. For additional information about borrowings and anticipated principal repayments refer to Note 7 Debt and Other Borrowings and Note 9 Commitments and Contingencies in this Form 10-Q. We prepare a cash flow forecast on a 30, 60 and 90 day basis along with a one and two year basis. These projections incorporate expected cash flows on loans, investment securities, and deposits based on data used to prepare our interest rate risk analyses. As of March 31, 2024, Primis was not aware of any known trends, events or uncertainties that have or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on our liquidity. As of March 31, 2024, Primis has no material commitments or long-term debt for capital expenditures. Capital Resources Capital management consists of providing equity to support both current and future operations. Primis Financial Corp. and its subsidiary, Primis Bank, are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory - and possibly additional discretionary - actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on our financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action PCA ), we must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of our assets, liabilities and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. The capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings and other factors. As of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the most recent regulatory notifications categorized the Bank as well capitalized under regulatory framework for PCA. Federal banking agencies do not provide a similar well capitalized threshold for bank holding companies. Quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require us to maintain minimum amounts and ratios of Total and Tier I capital (as defined in the regulations) to average assets (as defined). Management believes, as of March 31, 2024, that Primis meets all capital adequacy requirements to which it is subject.

Minimum Required for Capital To Be Actual Ratio at Adequacy Categorized as March 31, December 31, Purposes Well Capitalized (1) 2024 2023 Primis Financial Corp. Leverage ratio 4.00 n/a 8.38 8.37 Common equity tier 1 capital ratio 4.50 n/a 8.98 8.96 Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio 6.00 n/a 9.27 9.25 Total risk-based capital ratio 8.00 n/a 12.62 13.44 Primis Bank Leverage ratio 4.00 5.00 9.91 9.80 Common equity tier 1 capital ratio 7.00 6.50 11.09 10.88 Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio 8.50 8.00 11.09 10.88 Total risk-based capital ratio 10.50 10.00 12.35 12.12 

 (1) Prompt corrective action provisions are not applicable at the bank holding company level. 
 Bank regulatory agencies have approved regulatory capital guidelines Basel III aimed at strengthening existing capital requirements for banking organizations. The Basel III Capital Rules require Primis Financial Corp. and Primis Bank to maintain (i) a minimum ratio of Common Equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 4.5 , plus a 2.5 capital conservation buffer , (ii) a minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 6.0 , plus the capital conservation buffer, (iii) a minimum ratio of Total capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 8.0 , plus the capital conservation buffer and (iv) a minimum leverage ratio of 4.0 . Failure to meet minimum capital requirements may result in certain actions by regulators which could have a direct material effect on the consolidated financial statements. Primis Financial Corp. and Primis Bank remain well-capitalized under Basel III capital requirements. Primis Bank had a capital conservation buffer of 4.35 as of March 31, 2024, which exceeded the 2.50 minimum requirement below which the regulators may impose limits on distributions. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES The critical accounting policies are discussed in MD A in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Significant accounting policies and changes in accounting principles and effects of new accounting pronouncements are discussed in Note 1 - Organization and Significant Accounting Policies in the Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Disclosures regarding changes in our significant accounting policies since year end and the effects of new accounting pronouncements are included in Note 1 - Accounting Policies in this Form 10-Q. There have been no changes to the significant accounting policies during the first three months of 2024. ITEM 3 QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are engaged primarily in the business of investing funds obtained from deposits and borrowings into interest-earning loans and investments. Consequently, our earnings depend to a significant extent on our net interest income, which is the difference between the interest income on loans and other investments and the interest expense on deposits and borrowings. To the extent that our interest-bearing liabilities do not reprice or mature at the same time as our interest-earning assets, we are subject to interest rate risk and corresponding fluctuations in net interest income. Our Asset-Liability Committee ALCO meets regularly and is responsible for reviewing our interest rate sensitivity position and establishing policies to monitor and limit exposure to interest rate risk. The policies established by the ALCO are reviewed and approved by our Board of Directors. We have employed asset/liability management policies that seek to manage our net interest income, without having to incur unacceptable levels of credit or investment risk.

 We use simulation modeling to manage our interest rate risk, and review quarterly interest sensitivity. This approach uses a model which generates estimates of the change in our economic value of equity EVE over a range of interest rate scenarios. EVE is the present value of expected cash flows from assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet contracts using assumptions including estimated loan prepayment rates, reinvestment rates and deposit decay rates. Based on an analysis of our interest rate risk as measured by the estimated change in EVE resulting from instantaneous and sustained parallel shifts in the yield curve (plus 400 basis points or minus 100 basis points, measured in 100 basis point increments) as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, all changes are within our Asset/Liability Risk Management Policy guidelines. Our interest rate sensitivity is also monitored by management through the use of a model that generates estimates of the change in the net interest income NII over a range of interest rate scenarios. NII depends upon the relative amounts of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and the interest rates earned or paid on them. In this regard, the model assumes that the composition of our interest sensitive assets and liabilities existing as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 remains constant over the period being measured and also assumes that a particular change in interest rates is reflected uniformly across the yield curve regardless of the duration to maturity or repricing of specific assets and liabilities. All changes are within our ALM Policy guidelines as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Certain shortcomings are inherent in the methodology used in the above interest rate risk measurements. Modeling changes in EVE and NII sensitivity requires the making of certain assumptions that may or may not reflect the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates. Accordingly, although the modeling of EVE and NII provide an indication of our interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time, such measurements are not intended to, and do not, provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on our net worth and NII. Sensitivity of EVE and NII are modeled using different assumptions and approaches. ITEM 4 CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures. (a) Disclosure controls and procedures are our controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. As of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report on Form 10-Q, under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, we have evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d -15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) utilizing the framework established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that these controls and procedures are not effective as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. This conclusion was reached as a result of the continued remediation of previously identified material weaknesses in its internal controls over financial reporting as further described in Item 9A in the 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. (b) Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting . There were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the three months ended March 31, 2024 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting. During the three months ended March 31, 2024, the Company continued to remediate the material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting as previously identified and disclosed in Item 9A. in the 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. While management believes it has put effective controls in place to remediate the previously identified material weaknesses, the controls have not been operating for a sufficient amount of time to conclude that the material weakness has been fully remediated. The Company will continue to operate and test the new controls until it believes they have been operating effectively for a sufficient amount of time. The Company anticipates the material weaknesses to be fully remediated as soon as possible.
