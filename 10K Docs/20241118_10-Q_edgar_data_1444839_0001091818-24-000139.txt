2024 and 2023 were 61,509 and 4,527,732, respectively. The decrease during the three months ending September 30, 2024, was due to the

of 96,078,741 and a working capital deficit of 699,579. 

As indicated herein, we need capital for the implementation
of our new business plan in the entertainment, hospitality, and technology sectors, and we will need additional capital for continuing
our operations. We do not have sufficient revenues to pay our operating expenses at this time. Unless the Company is able to raise working
capital, it is likely that the Company will either have to cease operations or substantially change its methods of operations or change
its business plan.

Critical Accounting Policies 

Our consolidated financial statements and accompanying
notes are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. Preparing financial statements requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that impact the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. These estimates
and assumptions are affected by management s application of accounting policies. Critical accounting policies include revenue recognition
and impairment of long-lived assets. 

New Accounting Pronouncements 

Bravo Multinational, Inc. does not expect the adoption
of recently issued accounting pronouncements to have a significant impact on the Company, or any of its subsidiaries operating results,
financial position, or cash flow. 

Accounting Principals 

Our consolidated financial statements and accompanying
notes are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. Preparing financial statements requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that impact the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. These estimates
and assumptions are affected by management s application of accounting policies. Critical accounting policies include revenue recognition
and impairment of long-lived assets. 

Revenue Recognition 

In accordance with ASC Topic 606, Revenue from
Contracts with Customers ASC 606 ), revenues are recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred
to our clients, in an amount that reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for those goods and services.
To achieve this core principle, we apply the following five steps: (1) Identify the contract with a client; (2) Identify the performance
obligations in the contract; (3) Determine the transaction price; (4) Allocate the transaction price to performance obligations in the
contract; and (5) Recognize revenues when or as the company satisfies a performance obligation. 

We adopted this ASU on January 1, 2018. Although the
new revenue standard is expected to have an immaterial impact, if any, on our ongoing net income, we did implement changes to our processes
related to revenue recognition and the control activities within them. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements. 

Going Concern 

We have incurred net losses since our inception. We
anticipate incurring additional losses before realizing growth in revenue and we will depend on additional financing in order to meet
our continuing obligations and ultimately to attain profitability. Our ability to obtain additional financing, whether through the issuance
of additional equity or through the assumption of debt, is uncertain. Accordingly, our independent auditors report on our financial statements
for the year ended December 31, 2023 includes an explanatory paragraph regarding concerns about our ability to continue as a going concern,
including additional information contained in the notes to our financial statements describing the circumstances leading to this disclosure.
The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the uncertainty about our ability to continue our business. 

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES
ABOUT MARKET RISK 

Not applicable 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Our management, with the participation of our Principal
Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form
10-Q. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter
how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design
of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and that management is required to apply
its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs. 

Based on our evaluation, our Principal Executive Officer
and Principal Financial Officer, after considering the existence of material weaknesses identified, determined that our internal control
over financial reporting disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2024. 

Evaluation of Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

Our management is responsible for establishing and
maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability
of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles. 

- 13 - 

Our internal control over financial reporting includes
those policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect
the transactions and dispositions of our assets, (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures
are being made only in accordance with the authorization of our management and directors, and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our
financial statements. 

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control
over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods
are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the
policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

Management, including our Principal Executive Officer
and Principal Financial Officer, assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2024.
In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013). 

We identified the following deficiencies which together
constitute a material weakness in our assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of September 30,
2024: 

- 
 The Company has inadequate segregation of duties within its cash disbursement control design. 

- 
 During the period ended September 30, 2024, the Company internally performed all aspects of its financial reporting process, including, but not limited to the underlying accounting records and the recording of journal entries and for the preparation of financial statements. This process was deficient, because these duties were performed often times by the same people, and therefore a lack of review was created over the financial reporting process that might result in a failure to detect errors in spreadsheets, calculations, or assumptions used to compile the financial statements and related disclosures as filed with the SEC. These control deficiencies could result in a material misstatement to our interim or annual financial statements that would not be prevented or detected. 

It should be noted that any system of controls, however
well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, and not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the system are met. In addition,
the design of any control system is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events. Because of these and
other inherent limitations of the control system, there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals
under all potential future conditions. 

This report does not include an attestation report
of the Company s registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management s report was not subject
to attestation by the Company s registered public accounting firm pursuant to rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit
us to provide only management s report in this annual report. 

We regularly review our system of internal control
over financial reporting to ensure that we maintain an effective internal control environment. If deficiencies appear in our internal
controls, management will make changes that address those deficiencies. 

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

There have been no changes in the Company s internal
control over financial reporting that occurred during the reporting period ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or
are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting. 

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION

ITEM 5. 

On July 18, 2024, the Company entered the telecommunications
sector through its newly established, wholly owned subsidiary, Mobile 13, Inc., which was to provide mobile phone services to consumers
in 50 states and Puerto Rico. On October 29, 2024, the Board of Directors decided to discontinue with its Mobile13, Inc. subsidiary, no
longer pursuing a business interest in the mobile telecommunications sector. The decision was made due to lack of funding, expertise,
and the competitive nature of the cellular telecommunications market. The Mobile 13, Inc. wholly-owned subsidiary and its MVNO (Mobile
Virtual Network Operator) license was transferred to Diversified Consulting, LLC, A Nevada LLC, in exchange for the cancellation of 1,000
Promissory Note.
