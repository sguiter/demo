As a result of the closing of the Share Exchange Agreement, the Company discontinued all aspects of its health care consulting business, and the Company is now focused on developing the GenFlat business plan. GenFlat is a start-up company that developed a more sustainable collapsible marine container, replacing traditional standard marine containers. GenFlat operates as a container sales and leasing company and supplies GenFlat s patented marine container primarily to shipping line customers under a variety of short and long-term lease structures.

The Company changed its name from Healthcare Business Resources Inc. to GenFlat Holdings, Inc. to better reflect its new business operations. Liquidity and Going Concern These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles applicable to a going concern, which assumes that the Company will be able to meet its obligations and continue its operations for its next fiscal year. Realization values may be substantially different from carrying values as shown and these financial statements do not give effect to adjustments that would be necessary to the carrying values and classification of assets and liabilities should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. As of September 30, 2024 the Company had not yet achieved consistent profitable operations and expects to incur further losses in the development of its business, all of which raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to generate future profitable operations and/or to obtain the necessary financing to meet its obligations and repay its liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due. Management has initiated a formal sales and marketing plan including direct email campaigns, industry events, and business-to-business digital advertising to generate sales. The Company also intends to raise funds through an equity offering to meet the capital requirements to manufacturer its products. However, there is no assurance of additional funding being available through these plans or other sources. F-5 Table of Contents Use of Estimates Cash and Cash Equivalents Rental Inventory years. Generally, when rental equipment is acquired, the Company estimates the period that it will hold the asset, primarily based on historical measures of the amount of rental activity (e.g. equipment usage) and the targeted age of equipment at the time of disposal. The Company also estimates the residual value of the applicable rental equipment at the expected time of disposal. The residual value for rental equipment is affected by factors which include equipment age and amount of usage. Depreciation is recorded over the estimated holding period. Depreciation rates are reviewed on a quarterly basis based on management s ongoing assessment of present and estimated future market conditions, their effect on residual values at the time of disposal and the estimated holding periods. Market conditions for used equipment sales can also be affected by external factors such as the economy, natural disasters, fuel prices, supply of similar used equipment, the market price for similar new equipment and incentives offered by manufacturers of new equipment. These key factors are considered when estimating future residual values and assessing depreciation rates. As a result of this ongoing assessment, the Company makes periodic adjustments to depreciation rates of rental equipment in response to changed market conditions.

We operate as a container sales and leasing company and supply GenFlat s patented marine container primarily to shipping line customers under a variety of short and long-term lease structures. We commenced commercial operations in May of 2024. Presently, our commercial operations consist of an equipment lease agreement to provide GenFlat Containers to one customer. The lease agreement demonstrates commercial acceptance of our GenFlat container. Our Company is also in various stages of evaluation with potential customers to lease GenFlat Containers including shipping lines, retailers, logistics companies, and the United States military. The Company also has a non-commercial proof-of-concept agreement with a freight forwarding company in the Middle East, which commenced in August 2024. The GenFlat Containers are manufactured by China International Mariner Containers CIMC in Dalian, China. Manufacturing and marketing of GenFlate containers commenced in September 2023.

All prior period information presented within this filing is of GenFlat, Inc. historical operations. See Note 1 to our UnauditedConsolidated Interim Financial Statements appearing elsewhere in this report on Form 10-Q. Results of Operations for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 The following discussion compares operating data for the three months ended September 30, 2024, to the data for the three months ended September 30, 2023: Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change Change Revenue 7,894 - 7,894 100 Cost of Goods Sold 53,194 - 53,194 100 Gross Profit (45,300 (45,300 100 Research and Development 36,000 - (36,000 100 General and administrative 1,685,747 133,521 1,552,226 1,163 Total operating expenses 1,721,747 133,521 1,588,226 1,189 Net loss from operations (1,767,047 (133,521 (1,633,526 1,223 Revenue Revenue was 7,894 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 0 for 2023, an increase of 7,894, which was the result of the Company s first contract for the leasing of GenFlat Containers. Costs of Goods Sold Costs of goods sold was 53,194 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 0 for 2023, an increase of 53,194. The cost of goods sold for the three months ended September 30, 2024 related to 39,750 of depreciation expense of rental inventory and 13,444 transportation expenses of the Company s collapsible marine container. Research and Development Expenses Research and development expenses were 36,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 0 for 2023, an increase of 36,000, which was the result of increased engineering, consulting and research and development activity of the Company s collapsible marine container. 4 Table of Contents General and Administrative Expenses General and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024, were 1,685,747, compared to 133,521 for 2023, an increase of 1,552,226, which was primarily related to an increase in stock-based compensation of 1,485,719, compensation expense, salaries, and benefits, consulting and marketing and advertising-related expenses, and other professional fees as a result of the Company increasing its operations around developing its product and raising capital, and public company reporting obligations. Cash Flows The following table summarizes our cash flows from operating, investing, and financing activities for the three months ended September, 2024, and 2023: Three months ended September 30, 2024 2023 Cash flows used in operating activities (229,648 (125,300 Cash flows used in investing activities - - Cash flows provided by financing activities 196,265 125,500 Net change in cash (33,383 200 Operating Activities Cash used in operating activities is primarily the result of our operating losses, reduced by the impact of non-cash expenses, including non-cash depreciation and amortization expenses, and changes in the asset and liability accounts. Net cash used in operating activities for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was 229,648 versus net cash used in operating activities of 125,300 for the three months ended September, 2023, an increase of 104,348. The increase in net cash used in operating activities was primarily due to an increase in net loss of 1,634,750 and stock-based compensation of 1,485,719. We expect cash used in operating activities to fluctuate significantly in future periods because of a number of factors, some of which are outside of our control, including, among others: obtaining additional lease contracts and the success we achieve in generating revenue. Investing Activities There was no cashflow from investing activities during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Financing Activities Net cash provided by financing activities during the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 196,265, an increase of 70,765 from cash provided by financing activities in 2023 of 125,500. The increase consisted of 17,000 of proceeds from loans from related party, 99,996 of proceeds from note payable from a related party, partially offset by repayments on related party notes payable, and repayment of advances from related party of 58,731. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our future expenditures and capital requirements will depend on numerous factors, including: the rate at which we can lease additional GenFlat containers to new and existing customers, the costs of filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights; market acceptance of our products and competing products, and the rate at which we hire employees to support operations. We expect that we will incur approximately 70,000 of expenditures per month over the next 12 months. 5 Table of Contents As of September 30, 2024, we had cash of 5,588, and working capital deficit of 226,308. We believe that our existing cash will not be sufficient to fund our present operations during the next 12 months and beyond. The Company s audited annual consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles applicable to a going concern, which assumes that the Company will be able to meet its obligations and continue its operations for its next fiscal year. Realization values may be substantially different from carrying values as shown and these financial statements do not give effect to adjustments that would be necessary to the carrying values and classification of assets and liabilities should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. At September 30, 2024 the Company had not yet achieved consistent profitable operations and expects to incur further losses in the development of its business, all of which raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We did not have during the periods presented, and we do not currently have, any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in the rules and regulations of the SEC. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The Company considers its critical accounting policies and estimates to be as follows: Revenue Recognition The Company is principally engaged in the business of renting collapsible marine shipping containers. The Company s rental transactions are accounted for under ASC Topic 842, Leases, Topic 842 ). Our revenue includes revenue generated from renting equipment to customers and is recognized on a straight-line basis over the length of the rental contract. As part of this straight-line methodology, when the equipment is returned, the Company recognizes as incremental revenue the excess, if any, between the amount the customer is contractually required to pay, which is based on the rental contract period applicable to the actual number of days the equipment was out on rent, over the cumulative amount of revenue recognized to date. In any given accounting period, the Company will have customers return equipment and be contractually required to pay more than the cumulative amount of revenue recognized to date under the straight-line methodology. Provisions for discounts, rebates to customers and other adjustments are provided for in the period the related revenue is recorded. The Company s sale of rental and new equipment, parts and supplies to customers are recognized under ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, Topic 606 ). The Company recognizes revenue when it satisfies a performance obligation by transferring control over a product or service to a customer. The amount of revenue recognized reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for such products or services. 7 Table of Contents Rental Inventory Rental inventory consists of collapsible marine shipping containers. Rental inventory is stated at cost, net of related discounts, with an estimated useful life of 10 years. Generally, when rental equipment is acquired, the Company estimates the period that it will hold the asset, primarily based on historical measures of the amount of rental activity (e.g. equipment usage) and the targeted age of equipment at the time of disposal. The Company also estimates the residual value of the applicable rental equipment at the expected time of disposal. The residual value for rental equipment is affected by factors which include equipment age and amount of usage. Depreciation is recorded over the estimated holding period. Depreciation rates are reviewed on a quarterly basis based on management s ongoing assessment of present and estimated future market conditions, their effect on residual values at the time of disposal and the estimated holding periods. Market conditions for used equipment sales can also be affected by external factors such as the economy, natural disasters, fuel prices, supply of similar used equipment, the market price for similar new equipment and incentives offered by manufacturers of new equipment. These key factors are considered when estimating future residual values and assessing depreciation rates. As a result of this ongoing assessment, the Company makes periodic adjustments to depreciation rates of rental equipment in response to changed market conditions. Accounts Receivable Accounts receivable is carried at their estimated collectible amounts. Accounts receivable is periodically evaluated for collectability based on past credit history with customers and their current financial condition. We had an allowance of 5,234 and 0 at September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, respectively. Long-lived Assets The Company amortizes acquired definite-lived intangible assets over their estimated useful lives. Other indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized but subject to annual impairment tests. In accordance with ASC 360 Property Plant and Equipment, the Company reviews the carrying value of intangibles subject to amortization and long-lived assets for impairment at least annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of long-lived assets is measured by comparison of its carrying amount to the undiscounted cash flows that the asset or asset group is expected to generate. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the property, if any, exceeds its fair market value. Leases We account for our leases under ASC 842 - Leases . We determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Operating leases are included in operating lease right-of-use ROU assets, current portion of obligations under operating leases, and obligations under operating leases, non-current on our balance sheets. Operating lease ROU assets and operating lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term at commencement date, adjusted by the deferred rent liabilities at the adoption date. Short-term leases of one year or less are not recognized as ROU assets and liabilities. If our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we use our estimated incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of future payments. The operating lease ROU asset also includes any lease payments made and excludes lease incentives and initial direct costs incurred. Our terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. Operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Recent Accounting Pronouncements From time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB that are adopted by us as of the specified effective date. There are no other recently issued accounting pronouncements that we have yet to adopt that are expected to have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. 8 Table of Contents ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. Not applicable. ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures. Our chief executive officer, who serves as our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act), as of the end of the period covered by this report on Form 10-Q. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer/principal financial officer concluded that as a result of the material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting discussed below, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective at ensuring that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding disclosure. The matters involving internal controls and procedures that our management considered to be material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2024 include the following: We do not have written documentation of our internal control policies and procedures. Due to our size and nature, segregation of all conflicting duties may not always be possible and may not be economically feasible. To the extent possible, the initiation of transactions, the custody of assets and the recording of transactions should be performed by separate individuals. A material weakness is a control deficiency (within the meaning of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board PCAOB Auditing Standard 1305) or combination of control deficiencies that result in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected. It should be noted that any system of controls, however well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable and not absolute assurance that the objectives of the system are met. In addition, the design of any control system is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of certain events. Because of these and other inherent limitations of control systems, there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions, regardless of how remote. In light of the material weakness described above, we performed additional analysis and other post-closing procedures to ensure our financial statements were prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Accordingly, we believe that the financial statements included in this report fairly present, in all material respects, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting . There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 9 Table of Contents PART II OTHER INFORMATION ITEM 1.
