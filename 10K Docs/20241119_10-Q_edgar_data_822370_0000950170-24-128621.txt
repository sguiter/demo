million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and had a working capital deficit of million as of September 30, 2024 . Management expects that the Company s current liabilities and expected working capital needs, including debt service on its existing indebtedness and the expected costs relating to the commercialization of Endari in the MENA region and elsewhere, will exceed its existing cash balances and cash expected to be generated from operations for the foreseeable future. To meet the Company s current liabilities and future obligations, the Company will need to restructure or refinance its existing indebtedness and raise additional funds through related-party loans, third-party loans, equity or debt financings or licensing or other strategic agreements. The Company has no understanding or arrangement for any financing, and there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to restructure or refinancing its existing indebtedness or obtain additional related-party or third-party loans or complete any additional equity or debt financings on favorable terms, or at all, or enter into licensing or other strategic arrangements. Due to the uncertainty of the Company s ability to meet its current liabilities and operating expenses, there is substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern for 12 months from the date that these condensed consolidated financial statements are issued. The condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of these uncertainties.

The convertible bond is convertible at the holder s option at any time and from time to time into common shares of Telcon at an initial conversion price of KRW , or approximately per share. The initial conversion price is subject to downward adjustment monthly based on the volume-weighted average market price of Telcon shares as reported on Korean Securities Dealers Automated Quotations Market and in the event of the issuance of Telcon shares or share equivalents at a price below the market price of Telcon shares and to customary antidilution adjustments upon a merger or similar reorganization of Telcon or a stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend or similar event.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 In the following discussion, the terms, we, us, our, Emmaus or the Company refer to Emmaus Life Sciences, Inc. and its direct and indirect subsidiaries. 
 Forward-Looking Statements 
 This Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC on July 3, 2024 (the Annual Report ). 
 This Quarterly Report contains forward-looking statements that involve substantial risks and uncertainties. All statements other than historical facts contained in this report, including statements regarding our future financial position, capital expenditures, cash flows, business strategy and plans and objectives of management for future operations are forward-looking statements. The words anticipate, believe, expect, plan, intend, seek, estimate, project, could, may and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. These statements include, among others, information regarding future operations, future capital expenditures, and future net cash flow. Such statements reflect our management s current views with respect to future events and financial performance and involve risks and uncertainties, including those set forth in the Risk Factors section of the Annual Report, many of which are beyond our control. 
 Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties occur, or should underlying assumptions prove to be incorrect, actual results may vary materially and adversely from those anticipated, believed, estimated or otherwise indicated. Consequently, all forward-looking statements made in this Form 10-Q are qualified by these cautionary statements. We undertake no duty to amend or update these statements beyond what is required by SEC reporting requirements. 
 Company Overview 
 We are a commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company engaged in the discovery, development, marketing and sale of innovative treatments and therapies, primarily for rare and orphan diseases. Our only product, Endari (prescription-grade L-glutamine oral powder) is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, to reduce the acute complications of sickle cell disease SCD ), in adult and pediatric patients five years of age and older. In April 2022, Endari was approved by the Ministry of Health and Prevention in the United Arab Emirates, or U.A.E, in adults and pediatric patients five years of age and older. In November and December of 2022, we received marketing authorizations for Endari in Qatar and Kuwait, respectively. In July 2023, we received marketing approval for Endari in Oman. Applications for marketing authorization is pending in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. While the application is pending, the FDA approval of Endari can be referenced to allow access to Endari on a named-patient basis. 
 U ntil August 2024, Endari was marketed and sold in the U.S. by our internal commercial sales team. In August 2024, we reduced our internal sales team and in October terminated the employment of our Chief Commercialization Officer, which we do not expect to adversely affect our Endari sales. Endari is reimbursable by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, and every state provides coverage for Endari for outpatient prescriptions to all eligible Medicaid enrollees within their state Medicaid programs. Endari is also reimbursable by many commercial payors. We have agreements in place with the nation s leading distributors as well as physician group purchasing organizations and pharmacy benefits managers, making Endari available at selected retail and specialty pharmacies nationwide. 
 As of September 30, 2024, our accumulated deficit was 260.8 million and we had cash and cash equivalents of 1.3 million. Until we can generate sufficient net revenues from Endari sales, our future cash requirements are expected to be financed through loans from related parties, third-party loans, public or private equity or debt financings or possible corporate collaboration and licensing arrangements. We are unable to predict if or when we may generate increased net revenues. 
 Financial Overview 
 Revenues, net 
 We realize net revenues primarily from sales of Endari to our distributors and specialty pharmacy providers. Distributors resell our products to other pharmacy and specialty pharmacy providers, health care providers, hospitals, and clinics. In addition to agreements with these distributors, we have contractual arrangements with specialty pharmacy providers, in-office dispensing providers, physician group purchasing organizations, pharmacy benefits managers and government entities that provide for government-mandated or privately negotiated rebates, chargebacks and discounts with respect to the purchase of our products. These 
 25 

various discounts, rebates, and chargebacks are referred to as variable consideration. Revenue from product sales is recorded net of variable consideration. 
 Under the Accounting Standards Codification ASC 606, we recognize revenue when our customers obtain control of our product, which typically occurs on delivery. Revenue is recognized in an amount that reflects the consideration that we expect to receive in exchange for the product, or transaction price. To determine revenue recognition for contracts with customers within the scope of ASC 606, we perform the following: (i) identify the contract(s) with a customer; (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction price to our performance obligations in the contract; and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) we satisfy the relevant performance obligations. 
 Management estimates variable consideration using the expected-value amount method, which is the sum of probability-weighted amounts in a range of possible transaction prices. Actual variable consideration may differ from our estimates. If actual results vary from the estimates, we adjust the variable consideration in the period such variances become known, which adjustments are reflected in net revenues in that period. The following are our significant categories of variable consideration: 
 Sales Discounts : We afford our customers prompt payment discounts and additional discounts to encourage bulk orders to generate needed working capital. 
 Product Returns : We offer our distributors a right to return product principally based upon (i) overstocks, (ii) inactive product or non-moving product due to market conditions, and (iii) expired product. Product return allowances are estimated and recorded at the time of sale. 
 Government Rebates : We are subject to discount obligations under state Medicaid programs and the Medicare Part D prescription drug coverage gap program. We estimate Medicaid and Medicare Part D prescription drug coverage gap rebates based upon a range of possible outcomes that are probability-weighted for the estimated payor mix. These reserves are recorded in the same period the related revenues are recognized, resulting in a reduction of product revenues and the establishment of a current liability that is included as accounts payable and accrued expenses on our balance sheet. Our liability for these rebates consists primarily of estimates of claims expected to be received in future periods related to recognized revenues. 
 Chargebacks and Discounts : Chargebacks for fees and discounts represent the estimated obligations resulting from contractual commitments to sell products to certain specialty pharmacy providers, in-office dispensing providers, group purchasing organizations, and government entities at prices lower than the list prices charged to distributors. The distributors charge us for the difference between what they pay for the products and our contracted selling price to these specialty pharmacy providers, in-office dispensing providers, group purchasing organizations, and government entities. In addition, we have contractual agreements with pharmacy benefit managers who charge us for rebates and administrative fees in connection with the utilization of product. These reserves are established in the same period that the related revenues are recognized, resulting in a reduction of revenues. Chargeback amounts are generally determined at the time of resale of product by our distributors. 
 Cost of Goods Sold 
 Cost of goods sold consists primarily of expenses for raw materials, packaging, shipping, and distribution of Endari . 
 Research and Development Expenses 
 Research and development expenses consist of expenditures for new products and technologies consisting primarily of fees paid to contract research organizations CRO that conduct clinical trials of our product candidates, payroll-related expenses, study site payments, consultant fees and other related costs. The costs of later-stage clinical studies such as Phase 2 and 3 trials are generally higher than those of earlier studies. This is primarily due to the larger size, expanded scope, patient related healthcare and regulatory compliance costs, and generally longer duration of later-stage clinical studies. 
 Our contracts with CROs are generally based on time and materials expended, whereas study site agreements are generally based on costs per patient as well as other pass-through costs, including start-up costs and institutional review board fees. The financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation and vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows. Payments under some of these contracts depend on factors such as the successful enrollment of patients and the completion of clinical trial milestones. 
 Future research and development expenses will depend on any new product candidates or technologies that we may introduce into our research and development pipeline. In addition, we cannot predict which product candidates may be subject to future collaborations, when such arrangements will be secured, if at all, and to what degree, if any, such arrangements would affect our development plans and capital requirements. 
 26 

Due to the inherently unpredictable nature of the drug approval process and applicable regulatory requirements, we are unable to estimate the amount of costs of obtaining regulatory approvals of Endari outside of the U.S. or the development of our other preclinical and clinical programs. In September 2023, we suspended most preclinical activities related to our product candidates to focus on commercial expansion of Endari in the U.S. and the MENA region. Clinical development timelines, the probability of success and development costs can differ materially from expectations and can vary widely. These and other risks and uncertainties relating to product development are described in the Annual Report under the headings Risk Factors Risks Related to Our Business and Risk Factors Risks Related to Regulatory Oversight of our Business and Compliance with Law. 
 General and Administrative Expense 
 General and administrative expenses consist principally of salaries and related employee costs, including share-based compensation for our directors, executive officers, and employees. Other general and administrative expenses include facility costs, and professional fees and expenses for audit, legal, consulting, and tax services. 
 Selling Expenses 
 Selling expenses consist principally of salaries and related costs for personnel involved in the promotion, sales, and marketing of Endari . Other selling expenses include advertising, third party consulting costs, the cost of in-house sales personnel and travel-related costs. Selling expenses is expected decrease due to reduction in sales force as exclusivity of Endari in the U.S. expires in July 2024. 
 COVID-19 
 In retrospect, we believe our business and net revenues were adversely affected in 2020 and 2021 by lockdowns, travel-related restrictions and other governmental responses to the pandemic related to the COVID 19 pandemic which inhibited the ability of our sales force to visit doctors offices and clinics and may have adversely affected the willingness of SCD patients to seek the care of a physician or to comply with physician-prescribed care. Ongoing COVID-19 infections or future official responses could cause a temporary or prolonged decline in our revenues and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. COVID-19 or governmental responses also may adversely affect the timing and conduct of clinical studies or the ability of regulatory bodies to consider or grant approvals with respect to Endari or our prescription grade L-glutamine, or PGLG, drug candidates or oversee the development of our drug candidates, may further divert the attention and efforts of the medical community to coping with COVID-19 or variants and disrupt the marketplace in which we operate. Any outbreak of COVID-19 among our executives or key employees or their families and loved ones could disrupt our management and operations and adversely affect the effectiveness of our management, Endari sales, and results of operations and financial condition. The foregoing factors could also have an adverse effect on economic and business conditions and the broad stock market, in general, or the market price of our common stock, in particular. 
 Inflation 
 Inflation has not had a material impact on our expenses or results of operations over the past two years, but may result in increased manufacturing, research and development, general and administrative and selling expenses in the foreseeable future. 
 Environmental Expenses 
 The cost of compliance with environmental laws has not been material over the past two years and any such costs are included in general and administrative costs. 
 Inventories 
 Inventories consist of raw materials, finished goods and work-in-process and are valued on a first-in, first-out basis and at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Substantially all raw materials purchased during each of the nine months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023 were supplied by one supplier. 
 Results of Operations: 
 Three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 
 Net Revenues . Net revenues increased by 0.5 million, or 9 , to 5.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 5.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 due to an increase in sales in the MENA region, partially offset by the decrease of U.S. sales as the orphan drug exclusivity for Endari has expired and a generic version of L-Glutamine oral powder has entered into U.S. market as discussed below. 
 27 

On July 15, 2024, ANI Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or ANI. announced the launch of its L-Glutamine Oral Powder, a generic version of Endari , following final approval of its Abbreviated New Drug Application from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The introduction of ANI s generic product or other generic versions of L-Glutamine oral powder has adversely affected on Endari sales and is likely to adversely affect the reimbursement rates that Medicare, Medicaid and third-party payors are willing to pay for Endari , which could have a material, adverse effect on our future net revenues. 
 
 Cost of Goods Sold . Cost of goods sold increased by 0.2 million, or 84 , to 0.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 0.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to the increase in sales discussed above. 
 Research and Development Expenses . Research and development expenses decreased by 0.3 million, or 65 , to 0.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 0.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in CRO expenses. 
 Selling Expenses . Selling expenses decreased by 0.2 million, or 12 , to 1.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 1.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to decreases in travel expenses and sponsorships. 
 General and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses decreased by 0.1 million, or 2 , to 2.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 2.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Other Income (Expense) . Total other income increased by 1.0 million, or 1,140 , to 1.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 0.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to decreases of 0.7 million in foreign exchange loss, 0.6 million in interest expense and 0.6 million in loss on debt restructuring, partially offset by a decrease of 0.8 million decrease in change in fair value of conversion feature derivative liabilities. 
 Net Income . Net income was 1.8 million and 0.1 million for three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase was due primarily to the increase in other income and decrease in expenses. 
 Nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 
 Net Revenues . Net revenues decreased by 9.2 million, or 41 , to 13.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 22.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 due to a shortage of finished goods inventory during the first half of 2024. While inventory shortage issue was resolved during the third quarter, subject to the effects of the introduction of generic L-Glutamine Oral Powder in the U.S. market discussed above, we expect that sales in the fourth quarter will rebound to levels experienced prior to the shortage, but sales for the full year are not expected to meet sales for the full year 2023. 
 
 Cost of Goods Sold . Cost of goods sold decreased by 0.3 million, or 23 , to 0.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 1.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to the decrease in sales discussed above. 
 Research and Development Expenses . Research and development expenses decreased by 0.5 million, or 49 , to 0.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 1.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in CRO expenses. 
 Selling Expenses . Selling expenses decreased by 1.5 million, or 23 , to 4.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 6.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to decrease of 1.0 million in payroll expense, 0.2 million in travel expense and 0.2 million in sponsorships. 
 General and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses decreased by 3.4 million, or 29 , to 8.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 11.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to decreases of 1.3 million in payroll expense including share-based compensation, 0.7 million in transaction cost, 0.3 million in settlement fees, 0.2 million in public relations expense and 0.2 million in professional services. 
 Other Income (Expense) . Total other expense decreased by 3.7 million, or 53 , to 3.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 7.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to an increase of 1.0 million in gain on restructured debt and decreases of 3.2 million in foreign exchange loss and 1.0 million in interest expenses, partially offset by an increase of 2.2 million in change in fair value of conversion feature derivative liabilities. 
 28 

Net Loss . Net loss was 4.7 million and 4.9 million for nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Based on our losses to date, current liabilities and anticipated future net revenues, operating expenses and debt repayment obligations and cash and cash equivalents of 1.3 million as of September 30, 2024, we do not have sufficient operating capital for our business without raising additional capital. We realized a net loss of 4.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and we may continue to incur net losses for the foreseeable future and until we can generate increased net revenues from Endari sales. There is no assurance that we will be able to increase our Endari sales or attain sustainable profitability or that we will have sufficient capital resources to fund our operations until we are able to generate sufficient cash flow from operations. 
 Liquidity represents our ability to pay our liabilities when they become due, fund our business operations, and meet our contractual obligations and execute our business plan. Our current primary sources of liquidity are our cash balances at the beginning of each period and net revenues, and proceeds from related-party loans and possible other financing activities. Our short-term and long-term cash requirements consist primarily of debt service under our convertible notes payable and notes payable, working capital and general corporate requirements and contractual obligations. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had outstanding 16.2 million principal amount of convertible promissory notes and 13.1 million principal amount of other notes payable. Our minimum lease payment obligations were 2.0 million, of which 0.9 million was payable within 12 months. 
 Our API supply agreement with Telcon provides for an annual API purchase target of 5 million and a target profit i.e ., gross margin) to Telcon of 2.5 million. To the extent these targets are not met, Telcon may be entitled to payment of the shortfall or to offset the shortfall against the Telcon convertible bond and proceeds thereof that are pledged as collateral to secure our obligations. In April 2024, Telcon offset KRW3.5 billion, or approximately 2.5 million, against the principal amount of the Telcon convertible bond and we released KRW893 million, or approximately 640,000, in cash proceeds to Telcon in satisfaction the target shortfall for the year ended 2023. 
 Due to uncertainties regarding our ability to meet our current and future operating and capital expenses, there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern for 12 months from the date that our condensed consolidated financial statements are issued, as referred to in the Risk Factors section of this Quarterly Report and Note 2 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included herein. 
 Cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 
 Net cash used in operating activities 
 Net cash used in operating activities increased by 0.1 million, or 4 , to 2.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 2.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was primarily due to a decrease of sales partially offset by decrease of operating expenses. 
 Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities 
 Net cash provided by investing activities increased to 2.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 0.5 million net cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to deemed sales of Telcon convertible bonds and the cessation of loan funding to EJ Holdings. 
 Net cash provided by (used in) from financing activities 
 Net cash used in from financing activities increased by 3.6 million, or 147 , to 1.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from a 2.5 million net cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was the result of 4.7 million reduction of proceeds received from issuance of promissory notes and convertible notes partially offset by 1.1 million reduction of repayments to promissory notes and convertible notes. 
 Off-Balance-Sheet Arrangements 
 We have no off-balance sheet arrangements.

Critical Accounting Estimates 
 Management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States GAAP ). The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of certain assets, liabilities and expenses. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate these estimates and judgments, including but not limited to those relating revenue recognition on product sales, the variables used to calculate the valuation of investment in convertible bond, conversion feature, stock options and warrants. We base our estimates on our historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the present circumstances. These estimates and assumptions form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates. 
 Refer to Critical Accounting Policies in Part II, Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of the Annual Report for our critical accounting policies. There have been no material changes in any of our critical accounting policies during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitati ve Disclosures about Market Risk 
 Not required for a smaller reporting company. 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 Disclosure controls and procedures DCP are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. DCP include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive and financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. 
 
 As of the end of the period covered by this Form 10-Q, we conducted an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our DCP. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company s DCP were not effective due to the material weaknesses described below. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024 which have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 
 Material Weaknesses 
 
 As previously reported, in connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2021, our management identified ongoing material weaknesses (the Material Weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. The Material Weaknesses related to ineffective controls over accounting treatment for complex accounting matters and financial closing process, lack of segregation of duties including access control over financial reporting system, inadequate documentation of policies and procedures over risk assessments, internal control and significant account processes. 
 
 Since identifying the Material Weaknesses, we took several steps to remediate the Material Weaknesses, including: 
 
 engaging a third-party accounting consulting firms to assist us in the review of our application of GAAP to complex debt financing transactions; 

review and approval of Financial Statements and SEC Filings, using current GAAP Disclosure and SEC Reporting Checklists, done by someone with appropriate knowledge of and skills to perform such reviews; 

30 

continuing professional training and academic education on accounting subjects for accounting staff; 

enhancing attention to review controls related to our financial closing process and reporting; 

subscribing to relevant online services and other supplemental internal and external resources relating to SEC reporting; and 

establishing a Disclosure Committee to ensure more effective internal communication regarding significant transactions and our financial reporting. 

In 2022, we implemented an integrated cloud-based enterprise resource planning system to manage our financial information and replace our outdated financial accounting systems and software. As a result of these actions, management has concluded that the certain material weaknesses identified in previous fiscal years have been remediated but that there continued to be material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023. In particular, our finance and financial accounting department is not adequately staffed, which results in not all policies and procedures being properly documented. 
 
 During 2023, the Company paid 650,000 in exchange for the promise of a standby letter of credit from foreign sources which was determined to have been fraudulent. In connection with this matter, we identified an additional material weakness related to insufficient board of directors' oversight and a lack of internal governance processes and procedures surrounding the evaluation of and background checks of advisors in foreign jurisdictions where we have less familiarity with laws and business practices. 
 
 To address the material weakness related to insufficient board of directors' oversight noted above, our board of directors appointed a Steering Committee of our Co-Presidents at the time and independent directors following the termination of employment of our former Chief Executive Officer and we engaged outside counsel to advise management on additional steps which should be taken to properly vet the Company s advisors and others with which it seeks to do business in the future.

Part II. Other Information 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 Not applicable. 
 Item 1A. Ri sk Factors 
 
 The following should be read in conjunction with the Risk Factors section of the Annual Report and subsequent Quarterly Reports. 
 
 The market exclusivity for Endari for SCD in the U.S. expired on July 7, 2024 and Endari has no intellectual property protection of Endari in the U.S. or orphan drug or other market exclusivity in the MENA region, which lack of exclusivity may result in the introduction of generic versions of PGLG in the U.S. and MENA regions and adversely affect our Endari sales and results of operations in future periods. On July 15, 2024, for example, ANI Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or ANI. announced the launch of its L-Glutamine Oral Powder, a generic version of Endari , following final approval of its Abbreviated New Drug Application from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The introduction of ANI s generic product or other generic versions of L-Glutamine oral powder has adversely affected Endari sales volume in the U.S. and is likely to adversely affect the reimbursement rates that Medicare, Medicaid and third-party payors are willing to pay for Endari , which could have a material, adverse effect on our future net revenues. It is also possible that ANI or other generic maker will seek to introduce generic versions of Endari in the MENA region. 
 Sales of Endari depend on the availability of adequate coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors and governmental healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid in the U.S. and government payors in the MENA region. Patients who are prescribed medicine for the treatment of their conditions generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or a significant part of the costs associated with their prescription drugs. Coverage determination depends on financial, clinical and economic outcomes that often disfavors new drug products when more established or lower cost therapeutic alternatives are already available or subsequently become available. Although Endari currently is reimbursable by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, and every state provides coverage for Endari for outpatient prescriptions to all eligible Medicaid enrollees within their state Medicaid programs, the reimbursement amounts are subject to change and may not be adequate and may require higher co-payments that patients find unacceptable. The Company also has negotiated reimbursement rates for Endari in the MENA region which are comparable to Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement rates. Patients are unlikely to use Endari unless reimbursement is adequate to cover a significant portion of the cost of Endari . Future coverage and reimbursement rates will likely be subject to increased scrutiny from payors in the U.S. and perhaps government payors in the MENA region. Third-party coverage and reimbursement for Endari may cease to be available or adequate, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and prospects. 
 
 The market for Endari also depends on access to third-party payors drug formularies, which are lists of medications for which third-party payors provide coverage and reimbursement. The competition in the industry to be included in such formularies may lead to downward pricing pressures on us. Also, third-party payors may refuse to include Endari in their formularies or otherwise restrict patient access to Endari if a less costly generic equivalent or other alternative treatment is available. In this regard, Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement rate for branded products such as Endari are subject to decrease to the cost of comparable generic versions of the products such as ANI s L-Glutamine Oral Powder or other generic versions of Endari . In light of the recent launch of ANI s L-Glutamine Oral Powder, we expect to reduce the wholesale acquisition cost of Endari to address these reimbursement requirements. 
 
 Sales of Endari in the MENA region are subject to lengthy reimbursement terms compared to U.S. sales, and management expects that our accounts receivable aging will be adversely affected by such terms as sales in the MENA region increase compared to our U.S. sales.

Seller understands that the foregoing ACH authorization is a fundamental condition to induce Buyer to accept the Agreement. Consequently, such authorization is intended to be irrevocable. 

2. Reconciliation and Changes to the Weekly Amount: The Initial Weekly Amount is intended to represent the Specified Percentage of Seller s weekly Future Receipts. For as long as no Event of Default has occurred, Buyer shall on or about the fifteenth day of each month reconcile the Seller s Account Account Reconciliation by either crediting or further debiting the Seller s Account by the difference between the actual amount debited since the date of the last Account Reconciliation and the Specific Percentage of the actual Future Receipts collected by the Seller since the date of the last Account Reconciliation. Failure by Buyer to make an Account Reconciliation at any time for one or more months or portions thereof shall not be deemed as a breach of Buyer s obligation hereunder and each Account Reconciliation shall be made for the entire period of time since the date of the last Account Reconciliation. Buyer may, at Buyer s sole discretion as it deems appropriate and upon Seller s request, adjust the amount of the then- applicable Weekly Amount due under this Agreement in order to cause such Weekly Amount to more accurately reflect an amount which will reduce the need to credit Seller s account on a consistently recurring basis. 

3. Weekly Amount Upon Default. Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, the Weekly Amount shall equal 100 of all Future Receipts. 

4. Sale of Future Receipts (THIS IS NOT A LOAN): Seller is selling a portion of a future revenue stream to Buyer at a discount, not borrowing money from Buyer. There is no interest rate or payment schedule and no time period during which the Purchased Amount must be collected by Buyer. If Future Receipts are remitted more slowly than Buyer may have anticipated or projected because Seller s business has slowed down, or if the full Purchased Amount is never remitted because Seller s business went bankrupt or otherwise ceased operations in the ordinary course of business, and Seller has not breached this Agreement, Seller would not owe anything to Buyer and would not be in breach of or default under this Agreement. Buyer is buying the Purchased Amount of Future Receipts knowing the risks that Seller s business may slow down or fail, and Buyer assumes these risks based on Seller s representations, warranties and covenants in this Agreement that are designed to give Buyer a reasonable and fair opportunity to receive the benefit of its bargain. By this Agreement, Seller transfers to Buyer full and complete ownership of the Purchased Amount of Future Receipts and Seller retains no legal or equitable interest therein. Seller agrees that it will treat Purchase Price and Purchased Amount in a manner consistent with a sale in its accounting records and tax returns. Seller agrees that Buyer is entitled to audit Seller s accounting records upon reasonable Notice in order to verify compliance. Seller waives any rights of privacy, confidentiality or tax payer privilege in any such litigation or arbitration in which Seller asserts that this transaction is anything other than a sale of future receipts. 

5. Power of Attorney Seller irrevocably appoints Buyer as its agent and attorney-in-fact with full authority to take any action or execute any instrument or document to settle all obligations due to Buyer from Seller, or in the case of a violation by Seller of this Agreement or the occurrence of an Event of Default under Section 15 hereof by Seller, including without limitation (i) to obtain and adjust insurance;(ii) to collect monies due or to become due under or in respect of any of the Future Receipts; (iii) to receive, endorse and collect any checks, notes, drafts, instruments, documents or chattel paper in connection with clause (i) or clause (ii) above; (iv) to sign Seller s name on any invoice, bill of lading, or assignment directing customers or account debtors to direct payables to Buyer; (v) to file any claims or take any action or institute any proceeding which Buyer may deem necessary for the collection of any of the remaining Purchased Amount of the Future Receipts, or otherwise to enforce its rights with respect to delivery of the Purchased Amount; and/or (vi) to contact any Processor of Seller and to direct

such Processor(s) to deliver directly to Buyer all or any portion of the amounts received by such Processor(s) and to provide any information regarding Seller requested by Buyer. Each Processor may rely on the previous sentence as written authorization of Seller to provide any information requested by Buyer. Each Processor is hereby irrevocably authorized and directed by Seller to follow any instruction of Buyer without inquiry as to Buyer s right or authority to give such instructions. Seller acknowledges the terms of the preceding sentence and agrees not to (a) interfere with Buyer s instructions or a Processor s compliance with this Agreement or (b) request any modification thereto without Buyer s prior written consent. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the power of attorney shall only be effected thirty (30) days after an Event of Default under this Agreement. 

6. Fees and Charges: Other than the Origination Fee, if any, set forth above, Buyer is NOT CHARGING ANY ORIGINATION OR BROKER FEES to Seller.

8. Authorization to Contact Current and Prior Banks: Seller hereby authorizes Buyer to contact any current or prior bank of the Seller in order to obtain whatever information it may require regarding Seller s transactions with any such bank.

Seller authorizes Buyer and its agents to investigate its financial responsibility and history, and will provide to Buyer any authorizations, bank or financial statements, tax returns, etc., as Buyer deems necessary in its sole discretion prior to or at any time after execution of this Agreement. A photocopy of this authorization will be deemed acceptable as an authorization for release of financial and credit information. Buyer is authorized to update such information and financial and credit profiles from time to time as it deems appropriate. Seller waives, to the maximum extent permitted by law, any claim for damages against Buyer or any of its affiliates relating to any investigation undertaken by or on behalf of Buyer as permitted by this Agreement or disclosure of information as permitted by this Agreement.

13.1 Good Faith, Best Efforts and Due Diligence. Seller will conduct its business in good faith and will use its best efforts to continue its business at least at its current level, to ensure that Buyer obtains the Purchased Amount.

13.3 Financial Condition and Financial Information.

Seller agrees that until Buyer has received all of the Purchased Amount Seller will not voluntarily close its business on a temporarily basis for renovations, repairs, or any other purposes.

The Purchase Agreement is fully incorporated into this Addendum by reference and binds and inures to the benefit of each of the Parties hereto, and all their heirs, successors and assigns, the same as if such Additional Seller had signed the Purchase Agreement. All references to Seller in the Purchase Agreement mean individually, collectively and interchangeably the Original Seller and each Additional Seller. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Parties acknowledge that the initial Weekly Amount established in the Purchase Agreement is based on the average monthly sales of the Original Seller only. By signing this Addendum and adding the Additional Sellers to the Purchase Agreement, the Parties do not intend to re-calculate the Weekly Amount by including the average monthly sales of the Additional Sellers.

Each Seller hereby guarantees the prompt performance of the obligations of the other Sellers under the Purchase Agreement. Buyer may file suit against, or otherwise seek to collect receipt of the Amount Sold from any Seller without the necessity of Buyer first seeking to collect payment from the any other Seller or other party that may be liable for the obligations created by the Purchase Agreement. 

3. The Original Seller has received the Purchase Price on behalf of itself and the Additional Sellers. The Purchase Price shall be allocated among the Sellers in such amount a. they may agree upon, but each shall have an undivided interest in the entire Purchase Price. Each Additional Seller is an affiliate that controls, is controlled by, or under common control with, the Original Seller. The Additional Sellers agree that joining in the sale of the Amount Sold by signing this Addendum is in the mutually beneficial interest of all Sellers. 

4. The Parties acknowledge that each Additional Seller may maintain separate bank accounts and each Additional Seller will take such actions as are necessary or appropriate to enable Buyer to debit such Additional Seller's Approved Account. Each Seller agrees that Buyer may debit any or all Approved Accounts in such amounts as Buyer determines in its discretion until Buyer receives the Weekly Amount .
