shares of our common stock issued to shareholders of Jebour Two Limited. The acquired
assets include a Nevada State Athletic Commission Professional Promoter license, which will allow us to produce live kickboxing, boxing,
and mixed martial arts events in the State of Nevada, perpetual and worldwide media rights for 40 previously produced shows, and certain
production and staging equipment to be used in producing similar events going forward. 

The
acquisition of the assets of Fighting Leagues, specifically including the promotor s license, past media rights and production
and staging equipment, will allow the Company to assess the viability of promoting such combat sports events in the State of Nevada.
Whilst the assets acquired provides the Company the infrastructure and licenses to promote and hold such fights, the Company continues
to assess the profitability and time and effort required to hold such events in the State of Nevada since to hold such events requires
significant planning and capital and any potential earnings from such events may not be realized for up to 6-9 months. At present we
lack the capital resources to plan and hold such events. 

. 

Intangible
assets, such as the media rights to the 40 shows previously produced by Fighting Leagues, which are expected to generate cash flows over
a finite life are amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated economic life of the asset, which is years. Intangible
assets with finite lives are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
The carrying amount of this asset at the date of acquisition is 

to years.

ASC
Subtopic 740.10. 30 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements
and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position
taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. ASC Subtopic 740.10 provides guidance on recognition and measuring tax positions taken
or expected to be taken in a tax return that directly or indirectly affect amounts reported in financial statements. We pay tax liability

Item
2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 

The
following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the balance sheet as of June 30, 2024 and September 30, 2024 and
the financial statements for the three months period ended September 30, 2024, included herein. The results shown herein are not necessarily
indicative of the results to be expected for any future periods. 

We
are an emerging growth company incorporated in the State of Nevada on June 23, 2017. United Express Inc. was incorporated in the state
of Nevada on June 23, 2017. Our business is to provide a comprehensive management service for long and short distance logistics for clients
in the Company s target market area. 

Acquisition
of Fighting Leagues 

The
acquisition of the assets of Fighting Leagues, specifically including the promotor s license, past media rights and production
and staging equipment, will allow the Company to assess the viability of promoting such combat sports events in the State of Nevada.
Whilst the assets acquired provides the Company the infrastructure and licenses to promote and hold such fights, the Company continues
to assess the profitability and time and effort required to hold such events in the State of Nevada since to hold such events requires
significant planning and capital and any potential earnings from such events may not be realized for up to 6-9 months. At present we
lack the capital resources to plan and hold such events. 

Cash
Requirements, Liquidity and Capital Resources 

We
had 121 of cash on hand as of September 30, 2024 and 2,084 on hand as of September 30, 2023. We believe our cash on hand is unlikely
to be sufficient to meet our current working capital and capital expenditure requirements in the absence of substantial additional revenue
from our current operations or contributions of additional debt or equity capital. We do not have any commitments for additional capital
and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining any capital we may need on acceptable terms or at all. 

Results
of Operations for the three months period ended September 30, 2024 and for the three months period ended September 30, 2023 

For
the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded revenue of 29,112 from three customers which was primarily from logistics
services. For the three months ended September 30, 2023, the Company recorded revenue of 115,350 from three customers which was primarily
from logistics services.

Item
3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 

Not
applicable. We have no investments in market risk sensitive instruments or in any other type of securities. 

Item
4. Controls and Proce 

Pursuant
to Item 305(e) of Regulation S-K 229.305(e)), the Company is not required to provide the information required by this Item as
it is a smaller reporting company, as defined by Rule 229.10(f)(1). 

Item
4. Controls and Procedures 

Disclosure
controls and procedures 

Management s
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Under
the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, after evaluating the effectiveness
of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) as of the end of the period covered
by this Form 10-Q, we have concluded that, based on such evaluation, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure
that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and is accumulated and communicated to
our management, including our principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate
to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

PART
II 

OTHER
INFORMATION 

Item
1. Legal Proceedings 

In
the ordinary course of business, we may become a party to lawsuits involving various matters. The impact and outcome of litigation, if
any, is subject to inherent uncertainties, and an adverse result in these or other matters may arise from time to time that may harm
our business. We believe the ultimate resolution of any such current proceeding will not have a material adverse effect on our continued
financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 

The
Company is not currently a party to any material legal proceedings, nor are we aware of any other pending or threatened litigation that
would have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, cash flows or financial condition should such litigation be
resolved unfavorable. 

Item
lA. Risk Factors 

There
have been no material changes from the risk factors previously disclosed in Part I, Item 1A of the Company s Annual Report on Form
10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024 (the Form 10-K ), under the heading Risk Factors , and investors
should review the risks provided in the Form 10-K prior to making an investment in the Company. Risk Factors, any one or more of which
could, directly or indirectly, cause the Company s actual financial condition and operating results to vary materially from past,
or from anticipated future, financial condition and operating results. Any of these factors, in whole or in part, could materially and
adversely affect the Company s business, financial condition, operating results and stock price. 

Item
2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds 

On
September 21, 2023, we issued 12,380,951 shares to three non U.S. persons in an offshore transaction (as
those terms are defined in Regulation S of the Securities Act of 1933) in consideration of our acquisition of certain assets from Jebour
Two Limited and Fighting Leagues. This issuance was exempt from registration pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) and/or Regulation S of the Securities
Act, since the foregoing issuances did not involve a public offering, the recipients were (a) non US Persons as defined
in Regulation S and (b) subject to the required resale restrictions. The securities were offered without any general solicitation by
us or our representatives. No underwriters or agents were involved in the foregoing issuances, and we paid no underwriting discounts
or commissions. The securities are subject to transfer restrictions, and the certificates evidencing the securities will contain an appropriate
legend stating that such securities have not been registered under the Securities Act and may not be offered or sold absent registration
or pursuant to an exemption therefrom. The securities were not registered under the Securities Act and such securities may not be offered
or sold in the United States absent registration or an exemption from registration under the Securities Act and any applicable state
securities laws.
