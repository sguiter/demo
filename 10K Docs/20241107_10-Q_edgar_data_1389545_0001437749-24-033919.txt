reverse split of our outstanding common stock Reverse Stock Split (See Note 12, Stockholders Equity for further details). Except as otherwise specifically noted, all share numbers, share prices, exercise/conversion prices and per share amounts have been adjusted, on a retroactive basis, to reflect this 1-for- Reverse Stock Split. 

Potential Asset Sale Transaction and Dissolution 

On September 19, 2024, the Company entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the Original Purchase Agreement with PRN Physician Recommended Nutriceuticals, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company PRN ), pursuant to which PRN will acquire the Company s eyecare products sold under the Avenova brand and the related assets (the Avenova Assets (collectively, the Asset Sale Transaction ). On November 5, 2024, the Company entered into an amendment to the Original Purchase Agreement (the APA Amendment , and together with the Original Purchase Agreement, the Purchase Agreement that provides for, among other terms, an increase in the base purchase price to million from million and for PRN to provide the Company with a million secured promissory note, as further described below and under Note 19, Subsequent Events (the Bridge Loan ). Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, the Asset Sale Transaction is subject to certain closing conditions, including stockholder approval. Assuming stockholder approval is received and other closing conditions are met, the Company expects to close the Asset Sale Transaction in the fourth quarter of 2024. 

The Asset Sale Transaction would constitute substantially all of the Company s revenue generating and operating assets; however, PRN would not purchase any of the Company s other products and assets, including those that relate to the Company s wound care, urology or dermatology businesses. The Company s board of directors (the Board unanimously approved the Asset Sale Transaction and further determined that, if the Asset Sale Transaction is completed, the best opportunity available to optimize value to our stockholders is to wind-up the Company s affairs and pursue a liquidation and dissolution pursuant to a Plan of Complete Liquidation and Dissolution (the Plan of Dissolution under Delaware law that may result in distributions to our stockholders of our remaining asset value (the Dissolution ). 

The Company has called a special meeting of stockholders (the Special Meeting on November 22, 2024 for stockholders to approve (1) the Asset Sale Transaction and (2) the Dissolution subject to the Board s discretion to proceed with the Dissolution. 

On October 29, 2024, the Company announced that the Board determined that an unsolicited and non-binding acquisition proposal from Refresh Acquisitions BidCo LLC Refresh to purchase the Avenova Assets (the Refresh Unsolicited Offer is a Superior Proposal (as defined in the Purchase Agreement). As a result, the Company notified PRN of the Board s determination and the Company s intention to terminate the Purchase Agreement pursuant to its terms, unless the Company received a revised proposal from PRN such that the Board determined the Refresh Unsolicited Offer was no longer a Superior Proposal, all in accordance with the process provided in the Purchase Agreement. 

On November 5, 2024, the Company and PRN entered into the APA Amendment to the Original Purchase Agreement. The APA Amendment provides for the following primary revisions to the Original Purchase Agreement: (i) an increase in the base purchase price to million from million; (ii) the removal of debt financing contingencies and related PRN representations, while adding a new PRN representation that it has sufficient funding for the million base purchase price; (ii) PRN providing the Company with the Bridge Loan; and (iv) PRN providing the Company with an equity funding commitment letter (the Equity Commitment Letter from Roundtable Healthcare Partners V, L.P. that provides for up to million in financing to be used by PRN s parent company, Acumen Intermediate Holdings, LLC, and contributed to PRN for payment of the purchase price at the closing of the Asset Sale Transaction (with such updated terms, the Revised PRN Transaction Terms ). 

On November 5, 2024, the Company entered into the Bridge Loan that provides for the Company to receive a secured loan of up to million from PRN as the lender that will be funded in two tranches of million each upon the Company providing written notice to PRN on or after November 22, 2024 and on or after December 6, 2024. The amounts borrowed under the Bridge Loan are required to be used for working capital purposes, will bear interest at a rate of per annum and be secured by all of the Company s assets as collateral. The Bridge Loan is a short term secured loan that is to be repaid upon the earlier of the closing of the Asset Sale Transaction (to be repaid from the purchase price), immediately upon termination of the Purchase Agreement or February 28, 2025. 

For more information on the Asset Sale Transaction (including the Revised PRN Transaction Terms, the APA Amendment and the Bridge Loan), the Refresh Unsolicited Offer and the Dissolution, please see Note 19, Subsequent Events, the Company s Current Reports on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC on September 20, 2024, October 29, 2024 and November 6, 2024 and the Company s Definitive Proxy Statement on Schedule 14A filed with the SEC on October 16, 2024 (as may be supplemented, the Special Meeting Proxy Statement ). 

Discontinued Operations 

On March 25, 2024, the Company completed the DERMAdoctor Divestiture for an aggregate sale price of million. The Company recognized a loss on the DERMAdoctor Divestiture amounting to million in the three-month period ended March 31, 2024, which is recorded in loss on divestiture of subsidiary in the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations. 

In connection with the DERMAdoctor Divestiture, the Company entered into Transition Services Agreement with New Age Investments, LLC to provide for a customary and orderly transition of the business, including warehousing services provided by New Age Investments, LLC and fulfillment services provided by the Company, which has been included in continuing operations in subsequent periods since entering into the Transition Services Agreement. 

Going Concern 

The Company has sustained operating losses for the majority of its corporate history and expects that its 2024 expenses will exceed its 2024 revenues. Additionally, the Company expects to continue incurring operating losses and negative cash flows. Accordingly, the Company has determined that its planned operations raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least twelve months from the date of issuance of these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. Additionally, changing circumstances may cause the Company to expend cash significantly faster than currently anticipated, and the Company may need to spend more cash than currently expected because of circumstances beyond its control that impact the broader economy such as periods of inflation, supply chain issues, global pandemics and international conflicts (e.g., the conflicts between Israel and Hamas, Russia and Ukraine, and China and Taiwan). 

On September 16, 2024, the Board unanimously approved the Asset Sale Transaction and the Dissolution, both of which are subject to the approval of the Company s stockholders. On November 5, 2024, the Company entered into the APA Amendment that provides for, among other terms, an increase in the base purchase price to million from million and for PRN to provide the Company with the Bridge Loan, as further described below under Note 19, Subsequent Events. The Company is holding the Special Meeting on November 22, 2024 to obtain stockholder approval of the Asset Sale Transaction and the Dissolution, pursuant to the Special Meeting Proxy Statement. 

To address the Company s current liquidity and near term capital needs, the Company has and continues to evaluate different plans and strategic transactions to fund operations, including: (1) raising additional capital through debt and equity financings or from other sources; (2) reducing spending on operations, including reducing spending on one or more of its sales and marketing programs or restructuring operations to change its overhead structure; and/or (3) the divestiture of certain business or product lines and related assets such as the Asset Sale Transaction and the DERMAdoctor Divestiture. If the Asset Sale Transaction and/or the Dissolution are not completed, we will continue our corporate existence and the Board will continue to explore its options to secure immediate funding for ongoing operations due to significantly reduced available capital and liquidity, the strategic alternatives available to the Company, including returning capital to stockholders or, to the extent any funding or other viable alternatives are not available or if there is not sufficient capital remaining at the time to fund operations, then the Company may need to file for bankruptcy protection or commence a similar state law proceeding. In connection with such strategic options, the Company may issue securities, including common stock, preferred stock, convertible debt securities and warrants through additional private placement transactions or registered public offerings, which may require the filing of a Form S-1 or Form S-3 registration statement with the SEC. While the Company believes that the proceeds from the 2024 Public Offering (as defined in Note 9, Financing Activities ), the 2024 Warrant Reprice Transaction (as defined in Note 9, Financing Activities and the DERMAdoctor Divestiture improved the Company s liquidity for the first nine months of 2024, there is no assurance that the Company will be successful in completing the Asset Sale Transaction and/or the Dissolution or otherwise executing on alternative capital raising strategies at levels necessary to address the Company s ongoing and future cash flow and liquidity needs. The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue to operate as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and the settlement of liabilities in the normal course of business. These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts of liabilities that may result from uncertainty related to the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. If the Company s stockholders approve the Dissolution, the Company would consider liquidation to be imminent and apply the liquidation basis of accounting pursuant to the accounting principles generally accepted in the United States U.S. GAAP ).

The Company has elected to combine lease and non-lease components as a single component. This will potentially result in the initial and subsequent measurement of the balances of the right-of-use assets and lease liability for leases being greater than if the policy election was not applied. Leases include variable components (e.g., common area maintenance) that are paid separately from the monthly base payment based on actual costs incurred and therefore were not included in the right-of-use assets and lease liability but are reflected as an expense in the period incurred. 

The lease expense is recognized over the expected term on a straight-line basis. Operating leases are recognized in the condensed consolidated balance sheets as right-of-use assets, operating lease liabilities current and operating lease liabilities non-current.

As a result of certain call and put options within the Secured Convertible Notes and Unsecured Convertible Notes, the Company recorded an embedded derivative liability on its condensed consolidated balance sheets with a corresponding debt discount which is netted against the face value of the Secured Convertible Notes and Unsecured Convertible Notes. The fair value of the embedded derivatives were calculated using the Black Scholes valuation model using Level 2 inputs of the fair value hierarchy. 

The fair value of the December 2023 Warrants issued in conjunction with the 2023 Warrant Reprice Transaction as well as the accounting for the warrant amendment and preferred stock conversion price adjustments that resulted from the 2023 Warrant Reprice Transaction were classified within Level 2. 

See Note 11, Common Stock Warrants , subheading Summary of Common Stock Warrant Liabilities , for a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances for the warrant liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis using significant other observable inputs (Level 2) during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 

There were no transfers in or out of Level 1, Level 2 or Level 3 assets and liabilities for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 

Black Scholes Valuation Models and Assumptions 

The Company utilizes a Black Scholes model for various valuations as outlined throughout this report. The following tables summarize the assumptions utilized for valuations impacting results for the periods reported. See also Note 13, Equity-Based Compensation for related Black Scholes valuation assumptions. 

Warrant Liabilities 

Various of the Company s warrants have been subject to stockholder approval upon issuance or amendment and prior to exercise. Warrants requiring stockholder approval are recorded as a liability at fair value upon issuance or amendment and continue to be recorded as a liability at fair value at each reporting date until stockholder approval occurs at which time they are transferred to stockholders equity at their fair value on the date of approval. Fair value was determined using a Black Scholes model as outlined below. See Note 11, Common Stock Warrants for additional information and the definitions of the Company s warrants.

Warrant Down Round Feature Adjustment 

Terms of the Company s outstanding 2024 July Warrants included a down round feature adjustment whereby the applicable exercise price was automatically adjusted (see Note 9, Financing Activities ). When the exercise price was adjusted, the Company recorded a deemed dividend as a reduction to income available to common stockholders. In accordance with ASC 820, the deemed dividend is measured as the difference between (1) the fair value of the 2024 July Warrants immediately prior to the conversion price adjustment and (2) the fair value of the 2024 July Warrants immediately after the conversion price adjustment. Fair value was determined using a Black Scholes model, as outlined below.

The fair value of the embedded derivative was determined to be thousand as of March 31, 2024 in accordance with a Black Scholes valuation model. See also Note 3, Fair Value Measurements , subheading Black Scholes Valuation Models and Assumptions . Upon stockholder approval on May 28, 2024, the embedded call option no longer required liability treatment and was reclassified to equity. The fair value of the embedded derivative liability was determined to be thousand as of May 28, 2024. The change of thousand in fair value between March 31, 2024 and May 28, 2024 was recorded as a non-cash loss on change in fair value of embedded derivative liability in the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations.

Monthly redemption in cash required a total payment of thousand. Monthly redemption in stock required the issuance of shares equal to thousand divided by the lower of (i) or (ii) of the Company s common stock s average volume-weighted average price over trading days prior to the redemption.

The fair value of the embedded derivative was determined to be thousand as of the date of issuance. After stockholder approval of the underlying common stock, the embedded call option no longer required liability treatment and was reclassified to equity. The fair value of the embedded derivative liability was determined to be thousand upon stockholder approval. The change of thousand in fair value between the date of issuance and stockholder approval was recorded as a non-cash gain on change in fair value of embedded derivative liability in the consolidated statements of operations. See also Note 3, Fair Value Measurements , subheading Black Scholes Valuation Models and Assumptions . 

The lender s subsequent financing redemption option and certain events of default also represented embedded call options and the Company s monthly share redemption option represented an embedded put option.

Effective May 30, 2024, the Company amended its Certificate of Incorporation to effect a 1-for- reverse split of its outstanding common stock.

Proportionate voting rights and other rights of common stockholders were not affected by the reverse stock split. Any fractional shares of common stock resulting from the Reverse Stock Split were rounded up to the nearest whole share. All stock options outstanding, common stock reserved for issuance under the Company s equity incentive plans, common stock reserved for issuance under the Series B Preferred Stock and outstanding warrants were adjusted by dividing the number of affected shares of common stock by 35 and, as applicable, multiplying the exercise/conversion price by 35.

Equity Awards to Employees and Directors 

The Company grants options to purchase common stock to its employees and directors at prices equal to or greater than the market value of the stock on the dates the options are granted. The Company has estimated the value of stock option awards as of the date of grant by applying the Black Scholes option pricing model using the single-option valuation approach. The application of this valuation model involves assumptions that are judgmental and subjective in nature. See Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, for a description of the accounting policies that the Company applied to value its stock-based awards. 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company granted options to employees and directors to purchase an aggregate of zero and shares of common stock (177 shares post-Reverse Stock Split), respectively.

Expected term (in years) 

Risk-free interest rate 

Dividend yield 

Weighted-average fair value of options granted during the period 

Expected Price Volatility This is a measure of the amount by which the stock price has fluctuated or is expected to fluctuate. The computation of expected volatility was based on the historical volatility of our own stock. 

Expected Term This is the period of time over which the options granted are expected to remain outstanding. The expected life assumption is based on the Company s historical data. 

Risk-Free Interest Rate This is the U.S. Treasury rate for the week of the grant having a term approximating the expected life of the option. 

Dividend Yield The Company has not made any dividend payments nor does the Company have plans to pay dividends in the foreseeable future. 

Forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and reduce compensation expense ratably over the vesting period. This estimate is adjusted periodically based on the extent to which actual forfeitures differ, or are expected to differ, from the previous estimate. 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company granted shares of restricted stock to employees and directors. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company granted shares of restricted stock shares post-Reverse Stock Split) to employees and directors.

Overview 

We are a company focused on the development and sale of scientifically-created and clinically-proven eyecare and wound care products. Our leading product, Avenova Antimicrobial Lid and Lash Solution, or Avenova Spray, is proven in laboratory testing to have broad antimicrobial properties as it removes foreign material including microorganisms and debris from the skin around the eye, including the eyelid. Avenova Spray is formulated with our proprietary, stable and pure form of hypochlorous acid and is cleared by the Food and Drug Administration (the FDA for sale in the United States. Avenova Spray is available direct to consumers, primarily through online distribution channels, and is also available by prescription and dispensed by eyecare professionals for blepharitis and dry eye disease. Because dry eye is a complex condition, we offer a complementary portfolio of scientifically-developed products for each step of the standard at-home treatment regimen, including the Avenova Lubricating Eye Drops for instant relief, NovaWipes by Avenova, Avenova Warm Eye Compress to soothe the eyes, and the i-Chek by Avenova to monitor physical eyelid health. 

We also manufacture and sell our proprietary form of hypochlorous acid for the wound care market through our NeutroPhase and PhaseOne branded products. NeutroPhase and PhaseOne are used for cleansing and irrigation as part of surgical procedures, as well as treating wounds, burns, ulcers and other injuries. The Company currently sells these products through distributors. 

Through our former subsidiary DERMAdoctor, LLC DERMAdoctor ), the Company offered over 30 dermatologist-developed products targeting common skin concerns, ranging from aging and blemishes to dry skin, perspiration and keratosis pilaris. On March 25, 2024, we announced the closing of the sale of DERMAdoctor (the DERMAdoctor Divestiture ). We acquired DERMAdoctor in November 2021 in order to achieve overall revenue growth, cost reductions and profitability. We were unable to achieve those objectives with DERMAdoctor. Therefore, we determined to divest DERMAdoctor and consummate the DERMAdoctor Divestiture, having incurred historical losses including the loss of 124 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The DERMAdoctor Divestiture streamlined our business by reducing our cash burn and allowing us to focus on our core business. 

Recent Developments 

Potential Asset Sale Transaction and Dissolution 

On September 19, 2024, the Company entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the Original Purchase Agreement with PRN Physician Recommended Nutriceuticals, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company PRN ), pursuant to which PRN will acquire the Company s eyecare products sold under the Avenova brand and the related assets (the Avenova Assets (collectively, the Asset Sale Transaction ). On November 5, 2024, the Company entered into an amendment to the Original Purchase Agreement (the APA Amendment , and together with the Original Purchase Agreement, the Purchase Agreement that provides for, among other terms, an increase in the base purchase price to 11.5 million from 9.5 million and for PRN to provide the Company with a 1.0 million secured promissory note (the Bridge Loan ). Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, the Asset Sale Transaction is subject to certain closing conditions, including stockholder approval. Assuming stockholder approval is received and other closing conditions are met, the Company expects to close the Asset Sale Transaction in the fourth quarter of 2024. 

The Asset Sale Transaction would constitute substantially all of the Company s revenue generating and operating assets; however, PRN would not purchase any of the Company s other products and assets, including those that relate to the Company s wound care, urology or dermatology businesses. The Board unanimously approved the Asset Sale Transaction and further determined that, if the Asset Sale Transaction is completed, the best opportunity available to optimize value to our stockholders is to wind-up the Company s affairs and pursue a liquidation and dissolution pursuant to the Plan of Dissolution under Delaware law that may result in distributions to our stockholders of our remaining asset value (the Dissolution ). If the Asset Sale Transaction and/or the Dissolution are not completed, we will continue our corporate existence and the Board will continue to explore its options to secure immediate funding for ongoing operations due to significantly reduced available capital and liquidity, the strategic alternatives available to the Company including to return capital to stockholders or, to the extent funding or any other viable alternatives are not available, then the Company may need to file for bankruptcy protection or commence a similar state law proceeding.

The Company has called a special meeting of stockholders (the Special Meeting on November 22, 2024 to approve (1) the Asset Sale Transaction and (2) the Dissolution subject to the Board s discretion to proceed with the Dissolution. 

On October 29, 2024, the Company announced that the Board determined that an unsolicited and non-binding acquisition proposal from Refresh Acquisitions BidCo LLC Refresh to purchase the Avenova Assets (the Refresh Unsolicited Offer was a Superior Proposal (as defined in the Purchase Agreement). As a result, the Company notified PRN of the Board s determination and the Company s intention to terminate the Purchase Agreement pursuant to its terms, unless the Company received a revised proposal from PRN such that the Board determined the Refresh Unsolicited Offer was no longer a Superior Proposal, all in accordance with the process provided in the Purchase Agreement. 

Subsequent to this Board determination, in accordance with the process in the Purchase Agreement, the Company negotiated in good faith with PRN, and, as a result of these negotiations, PRN proposed amending the terms of the Original Purchase Agreement by entering into the APA Amendment, which provides for the following primary revisions to the Original Purchase Agreement: (i) an increase in the base purchase price to 11.5 million from 9.5 million; (ii) the removal of debt financing contingencies and related PRN representations, while adding a new PRN representation that it has sufficient funding for the 11.5 million purchase price; (iii) PRN providing the Company with the Bridge Loan; and (iv) PRN providing the Company with an equity funding commitment letter (the Equity Commitment Letter from Roundtable Healthcare Partners V, L.P. that provides for up to 13.0 million in financing to be used by PRN s parent company, Acumen Intermediate Holdings, LLC, and contributed to PRN for payment of the purchase price at the closing of the Asset Sale Transaction (with such updated terms, the Revised PRN Transaction Terms ). On November 4, 2024, after considering the Revised PRN Transaction Terms, the Board determined that the Refresh Unsolicited Offer was no longer a Superior Proposal and that it was advisable and in the best interests of stockholders to enter into the APA Amendment and the Bridge Loan. 

On November 5, 2024, the Company entered into the APA Amendment and the Bridge Loan. The Bridge Loan provides for the Company to receive a secured loan of up to 1.0 million from PRN as lender that will be funded in two tranches of 0.5 million each upon the Company providing written notice to PRN on or after November 22, 2024 and on or after December 6, 2024. The amounts borrowed under the Bridge Loan are required to be used for working capital purposes, will bear interest at a rate of 10 per annum and be secured by all of the Company s assets as collateral. The Bridge Loan is to be repaid upon the earlier of the closing of the Asset Sale Transaction (to be repaid from the purchase price), immediately upon termination of the Purchase Agreement or February 28, 2025. If the Asset Sale Transaction is not consummated, the Purchase Agreement is terminated and the Company is required to repay the full amount borrowed pursuant to the Bridge Loan, the Company may not have the necessary capital resources available at the time to repay the Bridge Loan absent the Company raising additional capital. 

For more information regarding the Asset Sale Transaction (including the Revised PRN Transaction Terms, the APA Amendment and the Bridge Loan) and the Dissolution, please see the Company s Current Reports on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on September 20, 2024, October 29, 2024 and November 6, 2024 and the Company s Definitive Proxy Statement on Schedule 14A filed with the SEC on October 16, 2024 (as may be supplemented, the Special Meeting Proxy Statement ). 

2024 Public Offering 

On July 26, 2024, the Company entered into the Underwriting Agreement with Ladenburg, as the sole underwriter, relating to the issuance and sale in a public offering (the 2024 Public Offering of: (i) 1,158,566 shares of common stock and 2,041,814 July 2024 Pre-Funded Warrants, in lieu of shares of common stock, (ii) 3,200,380 Series F-1 Warrants, (iii) 3,200,380 Series F-2 Warrants, and (iv) 3,200,380 Series F-3 Warrants. The 2024 Public Offering closed on July 29, 2024, and the Company received gross proceeds of 3.9 million, without taking into account any underwriting discounts and commissions. A portion of the proceeds were used towards repaying the Secured Convertible Notes, which were repaid in full during the third quarter of 2024. 

DERMAdoctor Divestiture 

On March 12, 2024, we entered into a Membership Unit Purchase Agreement (the DERMAdoctor Purchase Agreement by and among: (i) New Age Investments, LLC; (ii) DERMAdoctor; and (iii) the Company that provided for the sale of 100 of the membership units (the Membership Units of DERMAdoctor.

Amendment to the Security Agreement and Consent to Terminate the Subsidiary Guarantee 

The closing of the DERMAdoctor Divestiture was subject to certain conditions, which included the Company obtaining the consent of the holders (the Secured Parties of the Company s Original Discount Senior Secured Convertible Debentures due November 1, 2024 (see Note 10, Convertible Notes ), to (i) amend the Security Agreement, dated April 27, 2023 (the Security Agreement ), to remove the Membership Units and any assets of DERMAdoctor as collateral for the Company s obligations pursuant to the Secured Convertible Notes and for DERMAdoctor to be removed as a party to the Security Agreement and (ii) terminate the Subsidiary Guarantee, dated April 27, 2023, which DERMAdoctor entered into in connection with the issuance of the Secured Convertible Notes. 

On March 24, 2024, the Company and the Secured Parties entered into a First Amendment to the Security Agreement to effect the Security Agreement Amendment, and a Consent and Release to effect the 2024 Subsidiary Guarantee Termination. As consideration for the Secured Parties executing and delivering the First Amendment and the Subsidiary Guarantee Consent, which reduced the collateral available to secure the obligations under the Secured Convertible Notes, the Company provided each Secured Party the option, at the Secured Party s election, to receive upon the closing of the DERMAdoctor Divestiture either: (i) a new Series D common stock purchase warrant (the March 2024 Warrant ), or (ii) a new unsecured convertible note convertible into shares of common stock (the Unsecured Convertible Notes ). Based on the Secured Parties elections and as a result of the closing of the DERMAdoctor Divestiture, the Company issued: (A) a March 2024 Warrant to a Secured Party that is exercisable for an aggregate of 1,000,000 shares of common stock (28,572 shares post-Reverse Stock Split) and (B) Unsecured Convertible Notes to four (4) Secured Parties that have an aggregate principal amount of 525,000 or will be convertible into an aggregate of 3,750,000 shares of common stock (107,146 shares post-Reverse Stock Split). 

The Company incurred total issuance costs of 130 thousand in conjunction with the 2024 Subsidiary Guarantee Termination. The Company allocated 19 thousand of the issuance costs to the Unsecured Convertible Notes which was recorded as a discount in the Company s unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2024. The remaining 111 thousand was allocated to the embedded derivative liability and warrant liability and expensed as Other expense, net in the Company s unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. For additional information regarding the March 2024 Warrant and the Unsecured Convertible Notes that we issued, see also Notes 9, Financing Activities 10, Convertible Notes 11, Common Stock Warrants and 12, Stockholders Equity in the Notes to the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this report. 

NYSE American Notices 

On April 18, 2024, the Company received a notification Initial Deficiency Letter from the NYSE American LLC Exchange NYSE American stating that the Company is not in compliance with Section 1003(a)(ii) and 1003(a)(iii) of the NYSE American Company Guide (requiring stockholders equity of 4.0 million or more if the Company has reported losses from continuing operations and/or net losses in three of the four most recent fiscal years and 6.0 million or more if the Company has reported losses from continuing operations and/or net losses in its five most recent fiscal years, respectively). 

On May 28, 2024, the Company received a letter Additional Deficiency Letter from NYSE American stating that the Company is not in compliance with the minimum stockholders equity requirements of Section 1003(a)(i) of the NYSE American Company Guide. Section 1003(a)(i) of the NYSE American Company Guide requires a listed company to maintain stockholders equity of 2.0 million or more if the listed company has reported losses from continuing operations and/or net losses in two of its three most recent fiscal years. The Company reported stockholders equity of 160 thousand as of March 31, 2024 and has had losses from continuing operations and net losses in each of the last three fiscal years. 

Therefore, the Company has become subject to the procedures and requirements of Section 1009 of the NYSE American Company Guide and was required to submit a plan of compliance by May 18, 2024 addressing how it intends to regain compliance with Section 1003(a)(ii) and 1003(a)(iii) of the NYSE American Company Guide by October 18, 2025. On June 4, 2024, the Company received notice from the NYSE American that it had accepted the Company s plan of compliance and granted a plan period through October 18, 2025. During the plan period, the Company will be subject to quarterly monitoring for compliance with the plan. If the Company does not regain compliance with the NYSE American s listing standards by October 18, 2025, or if the Company does not make progress consistent with its plan, then the NYSE American may initiate delisting procedures. 

Additionally, the Asset Sale Transaction (to the extent completed) may cause the NYSE American to delist our shares of common stock and the Company may not meet NYSE American s continued listing requirements. To the extent the NYSE American does not delist our shares after completion of the Asset Sale Transaction and the Board determines to effect the Dissolution, the Company plans to request that our common stock stop trading on the NYSE American on the effective date of the Dissolution or as soon thereafter as is reasonably practicable.

Financial Overview and Outlook 

We have incurred net losses and generated negative cash flows from operations since inception and expect to incur losses in the future as we continue to commercialize our products. Our net losses were 2.2 million and 1.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. In addition, our net losses were 7.4 million and 7.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of 182.2 million, total current assets of 2.3 million and total assets of 3.9 million. 

To date, our plan to grow commercial sales of Avenova branded products primarily through an expansion of domestic market penetration of our online channels as well expanded product offerings through partnerships with other eyecare product providers has been unsuccessful. However, in an effort to maximize stockholder value, our Board unanimously determined to pursue the Asset Sale Transaction and the Dissolution, both of which are subject to stockholder approval at the Special Meeting. See Potential Asset Sale Transaction and Dissolution above for additional information regarding the Asset Sale Transaction and the Dissolution. 

Critical Accounting Estimates 

Our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The preparation of these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, as well as the reported revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. In preparing these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, management has made its best estimates and judgments of certain amounts, giving due consideration to materiality. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates. 

-49-

Table of Contents 

While our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this report, we believe that the following accounting estimates are most critical to fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results as discussed in this Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 

Impairment of Goodwill, Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets and Long-Lived Assets 

We review goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets and long-lived assets for impairment at least annually or whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that any such asset may be impaired, that the carrying amount of any such asset may not be fully recoverable or that the useful life of the asset, if applicable, is no longer appropriate. Management uses judgement in making critical assumptions and estimates in determining when an impairment assessment should be recorded, if more frequent than annually, or in the completion of any such assessment. This includes cash flow projections that look several years into the future and assumptions on variables such as future sales and operating margin growth rates, economic conditions, probability of success, market competition, inflation and discount rates. Changes in judgments with respect to these assumptions and estimates could impact any such impairments recorded such as those recorded in the fourth quarter of 2023 as further described in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies included in our 2023 Annual Report. 

Valuation of Contingent Consideration Resulting from a Business Combination 

We revalue any outstanding contingent obligations to pay future consideration related to business combinations at the end of each quarter and record increases or decreases in their fair value within our unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations. Increases or decreases in fair value of the contingent consideration liabilities can result from updates to assumptions such as the expected timing or probability of achieving the specified milestones. Significant judgment is employed in determining these assumptions as of the acquisition date and for each subsequent period. Updates to assumptions could have a significant impact on our results of operations in any given period. See additional information in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this report. 

Estimates of Future Product Returns 

The Company records revenue in an amount that reflects the consideration which the Company expects to receive. Accordingly, revenue is reduced for estimated future product returns. The Company s estimates for returns are updated quarterly based on historical data of actual returns. Actual future returns experience may differ significantly from historical data and could result in significant future adjustments, including a reduction of revenue recognized. 

Common Stock Warrant Liabilities 

For warrants that are classified as liabilities, the Company records the fair value of the warrants upon issuance and at each balance sheet date with changes in the estimated fair value recorded as a non-cash gain or loss in the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations. The fair values of these warrants are determined using the Black Scholes option pricing model. These values are subject to a significant degree of management s judgment.

General and administrative expenses increased 0.6 million, or 56 , to 1.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 1.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, due primarily to an increase in legal costs related to non-recurring strategic initiatives, including the 2024 Public Offering, the Asset Sale Transaction and the Dissolution, ongoing during the three months ended September 30, 2024. 

Accretion of interest and amortization of discounts on convertible notes

Impact of DERMAdoctor Divestiture 

The financial results of DERMAdoctor beginning from January 1, 2024 through the closing of the DERMAdoctor Divestiture on March 25, 2024 in the table above and as set forth in this report have been aggregated in the captions entitled Loss on divestiture of subsidiary and Net loss from discontinued operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 (see Note 18, Divestiture and Discontinued Operations in the Notes to the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this report). The discussions below and throughout this section apply only to results from continuing operations except as otherwise noted. 

Total Net Sales and Cost of Goods Sold 

Product revenue, net, decreased 0.9 million, or 11 , to 7.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 8.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

Revenue from eyecare products, including Avenova Spray, increased 0.5 million to 7.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 6.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was due to an overall increase in Avenova branded products sold through online channels. 

Revenue from the Company s wound care products decreased 1.3 million to 0.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 1.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

General and administrative 

General and administrative expenses increased 1.2 million, or 28 , to 5.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 4.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, was due primarily to an increase in legal costs primarily related to non-recurring strategic initiatives, including the DERMAdoctor Divestiture, the 2024 Public Offering, the Asset Sale Transaction and the Dissolution, ongoing during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

Loss on divestiture of subsidiary 

As a result of the closing of the DERMAdoctor Divestiture on March 25, 2024, we incurred a loss of 0.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 with no comparable activity for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

The warrant liabilities for the December 2023 Warrants and the March 2024 Warrant were reclassified to equity during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and will no longer require fair value adjustments which will impact our results of operations. For additional information regarding warrant liabilities and their valuation, please see Note 11, Common Stock Warrants , in the Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, in Part I, Item 1 of this report. 

Non-cash (loss) gain on changes in fair value of embedded derivative liability

Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources 

As of September 30, 2024, our cash and cash equivalents were 0.8 million, compared to 2.9 million as of December 31, 2023. Our cash and cash equivalents as of September 30, 2024 includes 2.9 million of net proceeds from the 2024 Public Offering, 0.2 million of net proceeds from the 2024 Warrant Reprice Transaction and 1.1 million of net proceeds from the DERMAdoctor Divestiture.

Under the terms of the Secured Convertible Notes issued in the 2023 Private Placement, we were required to make a monthly redemption of the principal amount of the Secured Convertible Notes Monthly Redemption over an 18-month period, which began on June 1, 2023 in an amount equal to 193 thousand per month, unless such Monthly Redemption is eligible under the terms of the Secured Convertible Notes to instead be settled through the issuance of our common stock. We paid the Monthly Redemption in cash every month until the Secured Convertible Notes were repaid in full during the third quarter of 2024. 

On March 25, 2024, the Company issued Unsecured Convertible Notes to four (4) Secured Parties that have an aggregate principal amount of 525,000 or will be convertible into an aggregate of 3,750,000 shares of common stock (107,146 shares post-Reverse Stock Split). The principal amount of the Unsecured Convertible Notes does not accrue interest and is payable to the Secured Parties upon maturity in March 2026, unless earlier converted into common stock. For additional information regarding the 2023 Private Placement, the Secured Convertible Notes and the Unsecured Convertible Notes, see Note 9 Financing Activities, Note 10 Convertible Notes, and Note 12 Stockholders Equity in the Notes to the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this report. 

On September 16, 2024, the Board unanimously approved the Asset Sale Transaction and Dissolution, both of which are subject to the approval of the Company s stockholders. On November 5, 2024, the Company entered into the APA Amendment that provides for, among other terms, an increase in the base purchase price to 11.5 million from 9.5 million and for PRN to provide the Company with the Bridge Loan. The Bridge Loan provides for the Company to receive funding in two tranches of 0.5 million each upon the Company providing written notice to PRN on or after November 22, 2024 and on or after December 6, 2024. The amounts borrowed under the Bridge Loan are required to be used by the Company for working capital purposes, will bear interest at a rate of 10 per annum and be secured by all of the Company s assets as collateral. The Bridge Loan is a short term secured loan which is to be repaid upon the earlier of the closing of the Asset Sale Transaction (to be repaid from the purchase price), immediately upon termination of the Purchase Agreement or February 28, 2025. The Company is holding the Special Meeting on November 22, 2024 to obtain stockholder approval of the Asset Sale Transaction and the Dissolution, pursuant to the Special Meeting Proxy Statement. 

Based primarily on the funds available on September 30, 2024, the Company believes that the Company s existing cash and cash equivalents and cash flows generated from product sales will be sufficient to fund its existing operations and meet its planned operating expenses into at least the first quarter of 2025. The Company has sustained operating losses for the majority of its corporate history and expects that its 2024 expenses will exceed its 2024 revenues. Additionally, the Company expects to continue incurring operating losses and negative cash flows. Accordingly, the Company has determined that its planned operations raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least twelve months from the date of issuance of these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. Additionally, changing circumstances may cause the Company to expend cash significantly faster than currently anticipated, and the Company may need to spend more cash than currently expected because of circumstances beyond its control that impact the broader economy such as periods of inflation, supply chain issues, global pandemics and international conflicts (e.g., the conflicts between Israel and Hamas, Russia and Ukraine, and China and Taiwan).

Table of Contents 

To address the Company s current liquidity and near term capital needs, the Company has and continues to evaluate different plans and strategic transactions to fund operations, including: (1) raising additional capital through debt and equity financings or from other sources; (2) reducing spending on operations, including reducing spending on one or more of its sales and marketing programs or restructuring operations to change its overhead structure; and/or (3) the divestiture of certain business or product lines and related assets such as the Asset Sale Transaction and the DERMAdoctor Divestiture. If the Asset Sale Transaction and/or the Dissolution are not completed, we will continue our corporate existence and the Board will continue to explore its options to secure immediate funding for ongoing operations due to significantly reduced available capital, the strategic and alternatives available to the Company, including returning capital to stockholders or, to the extent any funding or other viable alternatives are not available or there is not sufficient capital remaining at the time to fund operations, then, the Company may need to file for bankruptcy protection or commence a similar state law proceeding. In connection with such strategic options, the Company may issue securities, including common stock, preferred stock, convertible debt securities and warrants through additional private placement transactions or registered public offerings, which may require the filing of a Form S-1 or Form S-3 registration statement with the SEC. While the Company believes that the proceeds from the 2024 Public Offering and the DERMAdoctor Divestiture improved the Company s liquidity in the first nine months of 2024, there is no assurance that the Company will be successful in completing the Asset Sale Transaction and/or the Dissolution or otherwise executing on alternative capital-raising strategies at levels necessary to address the Company s ongoing and future cash flow and liquidity needs. The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue to operate as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and the settlement of liabilities in the normal course of business. These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts of liabilities that may result from uncertainty related to its ability to continue as a going concern. If the Company s stockholders approve the Dissolution, the Company would consider liquidation to be imminent and apply liquidation basis of accounting pursuant to U.S. GAAP. 

Cash Used in Operating Activities 

Net cash used in operating activities from continuing operations was 4.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, which consisted primarily of a net loss from continuing operations of 6.0 million, adjusted by depreciation and amortization expenses of 32 thousand, stock-based compensation expenses related to employee and director stock awards of 0.1 million, non-cash loss on divestiture of 0.9 million, non-cash expense for consent of Secured Convertible Note holders of 0.4 million, non-cash loss on modifications of warrants of 69 thousand, non-cash gain on changes in fair value of warrant liabilities of 0.1 million, non-cash loss on changes in fair value of embedded derivative liability of 18 thousand, non-cash right-of-use amortization of 0.3 million, accretion of interest and amortization of debt discounts on convertibles notes of 0.9 million, and a net decrease of 0.8 million in our net operating assets and liabilities of continuing operations. 

Net cash used in operating activities from continuing operations was 3.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, which consisted primarily of a net loss from continuing operations of 5.5 million, adjusted by depreciation and amortization expenses of 39 thousand, stock-based compensation expenses of 0.2 million, non-cash loss on modifications of warrants of 0.3 million, non-cash gain on changes in fair value of warrant liabilities of 0.2 million, non-cash gain on changes in fair value of embedded derivative liability of 40 thousand, non-cash right-of-use amortization of 0.2 million, accretion of interest and amortization of debt discounts on convertibles notes of 1.1 million, and a net decrease of 0.7 million in our net operating assets and liabilities of continuing operations. 

Cash Provided by (Used in) Investing Activities 

Net cash provided by investing activities from continuing operations was 1.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, which included the DERMAdoctor Divestiture proceeds of 1.1 million and purchase of property and equipment in a nominal amount. Net cash used in investing activities for the purchase of property and equipment from continuing operations was 16 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

Table of Contents 

Cash Provided by Financing Activities 

Net cash provided by financing activities from continuing operations was 1.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, which included repayment of 2.0 million for the Secured Convertible Notes through September 30, 2024, net proceeds of 2.9 million from the 2024 Public Offering transaction, and the net proceeds of 0.2 million from the 2024 Warrant Repice transaction. 

Net cash provided by financing activities from continuing operations was 1.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, which included the net proceeds of 2.8 million received in the 2023 Private Placement of the Secured Convertible Notes and the May 2023 Warrants and repayment of 0.8 million for the Monthly Redemption through September 30, 2023 on the Secured Convertible Notes. 

Net Operating Losses and Tax Credit Carryforwards 

As of December 31, 2023, we had net operating loss carryforwards for federal and state income tax purposes of 139.3 million and 117.4 million, respectively. The federal net operating loss carryforwards consist of 94.9 million generated before January 1, 2018, which will begin to expire in 2024 and 44.4 million that will carry forward indefinitely but are subject to an 80 limitation for years following December 31, 2021. The state net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in 2028. As of December 31, 2023, we also had tax credit carryforwards of 0.5 million for federal income tax purposes and 0.1 million for state tax purposes. If not utilized, the federal tax credits will begin expiring in 2031. The state tax credits have an indefinite carryover period. 

Current federal and California tax laws include substantial restrictions on the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards in the event of an ownership change of a corporation. Accordingly, our ability to utilize net operating loss carryforwards may be limited as a result of such ownership changes. Such a limitation could result in the expiration of carryforwards before they are utilized. 

Inflation 

Our costs are subject to fluctuations, particularly due to changes in the price of raw and packing materials and the cost of labor, transportation and operating supplies. Therefore, our business results depend, in part, on our continued ability to manage these fluctuations through pricing actions, cost-saving projects and sourcing decisions, while maintaining and improving margins and market share. Failure to manage these fluctuations could adversely impact our results of operations or cash flows. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

We did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements at September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023 as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K. 

Seasonality 

Avenova Branded Products 

Consistent with our peers in the United States pharmaceutical industry, prescriptions for Avenova Spray experience seasonality with the first quarter of each year typically being the lowest revenue quarter. This annual phenomenon is due to consumers facing the need to satisfy health insurance deductibles and changes to copays as each new insurance year begins. Sales of Avenova Spray through non-prescription channels, along with the other Avenova branded products, experience less seasonality with demands, with more consistent sales throughout the year. 

NeutroPhase and PhaseOne Branded Wound Care Products 

Our NeutroPhase and PhaseOne branded products are sold through wholesale distribution relationships with third parties such as Chongqing Pioneer Pharma Holdings Limited and Phase One Health; therefore, we receive periodic large orders that result in large chunks of revenue that are received in irregular intervals during the year. 

Contractual Obligations 

In the normal course of business, we enter into contracts and commitments that obligate us to make payments in the future. Information regarding our obligations under lease and convertible note arrangements are provided in Note 8 Commitments and Contingencies, and Note 10 Convertible Notes in the Notes to the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this report.

ITEM 3. 

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 

Our market risk consists principally of interest rate risk on our cash and cash equivalents. Our exposure to market risk is limited primarily to interest income sensitivity, which is affected by changes in interest rates, particularly because our current liquid assets at September 30, 2024 were held in cash and cash equivalents. 

Our investment policy restricts our investments to high-quality investments and limits the amounts invested with any one issuer, industry, or geographic area. The goals of our investment policy are as follows: preservation of capital, assurance of liquidity needs, best available return on invested capital, and minimization of capital taxation. Some of the securities in which we invest may be subject to market risk. This means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate. For example, if we hold a security that was issued with an interest rate fixed at the then-prevailing rate and the prevailing interest rate later rises, the principal amount of our investment will probably decline. To minimize this risk, in accordance with our investment policy, we maintain our cash and cash equivalents in short-term marketable securities, including money market mutual funds, Treasury bills, Treasury notes, certificates of deposit, commercial paper, and corporate and municipal bonds. The risk associated with fluctuating interest rates is limited to our investment portfolio. Due to the short-term nature of our investment portfolio, we believe we have minimal interest rate risk arising from our investments. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, a 10 change in interest rates would have had an immaterial effect on the value of our investment portfolio. We do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio. We do not hold any instruments for trading purposes. 

With most of our focus on the domestic U.S. market, we have not had any material exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuations. 

ITEM 4. 

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

As of the end of the period covered by this report, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Interim Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15 and 15d-15 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ). 

A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Assessing the costs and benefits of such controls and procedures necessarily involves the exercise of judgment by management. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. 

Based upon that evaluation at September 30, 2024, our Chief Executive Officer and our Interim Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure, at the reasonable assurance level, that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms and were effective in ensuring that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act was accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Interim Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the current quarter which has materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM 1. 

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 

From time to time, the Company may be involved in various legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. As of September 30, 2024, there were no matters that, in the opinion of management, would ultimately result in liability that would have a material adverse effect on the Company s financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 

ITEM 1A. 

RISK FACTORS 

For information regarding factors that could affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, see the risk factors discussed under Part I, Item 1A included in our 2023 Annual Report, under Part II, Item 1A included in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2024, which was filed with the SEC on May 9, 2024, and in the risk factors related to the Asset Sale Transaction and the Dissolution in the Special Meeting Proxy Statement (as may be supplemented). We are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and, as such, are not required to provide updated quarterly information under this Item.
