shares. On June 8, 2022, Reddington Partners LLC converted their Series A Preferred Shares into common shares. 

The
sale of the Shares to the Purchaser was completed on May 17, 2022. As part of the Stock Purchase Agreement, G. Reed Petersen agreed to
resign as the Company s sole officer and director; and the change of management was completed on June 5, 2022. On June 6, 2022,

Inc. d/b/a Mag Mile Capital f/k/a CSF Capital LLC Mag Mile Capital under which Mag Mile Capital was merged with and into
Myson. At the closing of the Reorganization Agreement, the sole member of the Myson Board of Directors and its officer resigned and Rushi
Shah, President and CEO of Mag Mile Capital, assumed the positions of Chairman of the Myson Board of Directors and the title of President
and CEO, Secretary and Treasurer of Myson. Under the terms of the Reorganization Agreement, Mag Mile Capital s shareholders now
own of the issued and outstanding shares of the Company s common stock or shares. 

The
Merger is accounted for as a reverse recapitalization. Mag Mile Capital is deemed the accounting predecessor of the Merger and will be
the successor registrant for SEC purposes, meaning that Mag Mile Capital s financial statements for previous periods will be disclosed
in the Company s future periodic reports filed with the SEC. 

On
May 15, 2023, the Company filed with the Oklahoma Secretary of State an amendment to the Certificate of Incorporation to change the Company s
name to Mag Mile Capital, Inc., that became effective on June 16, 2023. On September 5, 2023, the name change to Mag Mile Capital, Inc.

These conditions and the ability to successfully resolve these factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue
as a going concern. The financial statements of the Company do not include any adjustments that may result from the outcome of these
aforementioned uncertainties. 

The
Company s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to generate future profitable operations and/or
to obtain the necessary financing to meet its obligations and repay its liabilities arising from normal business operations when they
come due. We expect to use the exercise of warrants to meet our needs for growth for more than twelve months from the date of issuance
of these financial statements.

outstanding shares of Myson, Inc. 

For
accounting purposes, Mag Mile Capital is considered the acquirer, and the transaction is considered a capital transaction in substance
(i.e., the issuance of stock by Mag Mile Capital for the net monetary assets of Myson, Inc. Therefore, the assets and liabilities of
Mag Mile Capital are carried forward at their historical cost, and the assets and liabilities of Myson, Inc. are adjusted to fair value. 

The
equity structure (i.e., the number and type of equity interests issued) in the consolidated financial statements reflects the equity
structure of Myson, Inc., the legal parent, including the equity interests the legal parent issued to effect the merger. Accordingly,
the equity structure of Mag Mile Capital, the accounting acquirer, is restated using the exchange ratio established in the merger to
reflect the number of shares (or other equity interests) issued by the legal parent to effect the merger. 

The
operations of Myson, Inc. are included in the consolidated statement of operations from the date of the merger. The comparative periods

Special
Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements 

Certain
statements, other than purely historical information, including estimates, projections, statements relating to our business plans, objectives,
and expected operating results, and the assumptions upon which those statements are based, are forward-looking statements. 
These forward-looking statements generally are identified by the words believes, project, expects, 
 anticipates, estimates, intends, strategy, plan, may, 
 will, would, will be, will continue, will likely result, and similar
expressions. Forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties

effect of future plans or strategies is inherently uncertain. Factors which could have a material adverse effect on our operations and
future prospects include, but are not limited to: changes in economic conditions, legislative/regulatory changes, availability of capital,
interest rates, competition, and generally accepted accounting principles. These risks and uncertainties should also be considered in
evaluating forward-looking statements and undue reliance should not be placed on such statements.

specific business combination target and we have not, nor has anyone on our behalf, engaged in any substantive discussions, directly
or indirectly, with any business combination target with respect to an initial business combination with us. We intend to effectuate
our initial business combination using our capital stock, debt or a combination of cash, stock and debt.

Results
of Operations 

Results
of Operations for the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to the Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 

Revenue
and Gross Profit 

Our
revenue from commission income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, was 254,550 and 376,800, respectively, a decrease
of 122,250 or 32.4 . Revenue in the current period decreased due to challenging market conditions leading up to the U.S. Presidential
Elections and rapid rise in interest rates leading to a slower deal activity in the market. 

Our
commission expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, was 216,453 and 103,069, respectively, an increase of 113,069
or 110 . We saw an increase in commission expense due to the timing of revenue receipts for which the commissions were paid on. Additionally,
 93,125 was commission paid on a transaction back to the client in form a revenue rebate. 

Our
commission expense related party, for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, was 250,594 and 35,750 respectively,
an increase of 214,844 or 601 . Related party commission expense increased due to the timing
of revenue receipts for which the commissions were paid on . Related party commission expense is
for commission paid to Park River Investments, LLC, a company owned by the Chairman and CEO, where the Chairman and CEO was the procuring
cause for the revenue. 

Gross
Profit is our main revenue metric as it is net of commissions paid. We had a negative gross profit of 212,497 for the three months ended
September 30, 2024, compared to a gross profit of 237,981 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 

15 

Operating
Expenses 

Professional
fees for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, were 13,900 and 41,032, respectively, a decrease of 27,132 or 66.1 .
Professional fees consist mainly of legal, audit and accounting fees. In the current period we had decreases to both audit and legal

ITEM
3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. 

We
are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and, as such, are not required to provide
the information under this Item. 

ITEM
4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. 

Disclosure
controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our
reports filed or submitted under Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include,
without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted
under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer,
to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

We
conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, based on the framework in Internal
Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO and published in 2013, and subsequent guidance prepared by COSO specifically for smaller public companies. Based on that evaluation,
management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not sufficient as of September 30, 2024. 

A
significant deficiency is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting, that adversely affects
the entity s ability to initiate, authorize, record, process, or report financial data reliably in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles such that there is more than a remote likelihood that a misstatement of the entity s financial statements
that is more than inconsequential will not be prevented or detected by the entity s internal control. A material weakness is a
deficiency or a combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility
that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Management
identified the following material weakness and significant deficiencies in its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
financial reporting as of September 30, 2024: 

The
 Company did not maintain effective controls over certain aspects of the financial reporting process because we lacked personnel with
 accounting expertise and an adequate supervisory review structure that is commensurate with our financial reporting requirements. 

Material
 Weakness Inadequate segregation of duties. 

We
expect to be materially dependent on a third party that can provide us with accounting consulting services for the foreseeable future.
Until such time as we have a chief financial officer with the requisite expertise in U.S. GAAP, there are no assurances that the material
weaknesses and significant deficiencies in our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting will
not result in errors in our financial statements, which could lead to a restatement of those financial statements. Our management does
not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system,
no matter how well conceived and maintained, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control
system are met. Further, the design of a control system must account for resource constraints. In addition, the benefits of controls
must be considered relative to their costs. Due to the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide
absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, can and will be detected. 

This
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q does not include an attestation report from our registered public accounting firm regarding internal control
over financial reporting. Management s report was not subject to attestation by the Company s registered public accounting
firm pursuant to rules of the Commission that permit us to provide only management s report in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 

Changes
in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting 

During
the most recently completed fiscal quarter, there has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in
Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our
internal control over financial reporting.
