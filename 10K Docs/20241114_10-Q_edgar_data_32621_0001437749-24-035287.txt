 NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

reportable segment under Accounting Standards Codification "(ASC)" 280, Segment Reporting . The chief operating decision maker regularly reviews the financial information of the Company at a consolidated level in determining how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. 

R evenue is measured as the amount of consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for transferring goods. Revenue is recorded net of customer discounts, promotional allowances, volume rebates and similar charges. When the Company offers the right to return product, historical experience is utilized to establish a liability for the estimate of expected returns. Sales and other tax amounts collected from customers for remittance to governmental authorities are excluded from revenue. 
 
 Management must make estimates of potential future product returns related to current period product revenue. Management analyzes historical returns, current economic trends and changes in customer demand for the Company s products when evaluating the adequacy of the reserve for sales returns. Management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with establishing the sales return reserves in any accounting period. Additional reserves may be required if actual sales returns increase above the historical return rates. Conversely, the sales return reserve could be decreased if the actual return rates are less than the historical return rates, which were used to establish the reserve. 
 
 Sales allowances, marketing support programs, promotions and other volume-based incentives which are provided to retailers and distributors are accounted for on an accrual basis as a reduction to net revenues in the period in which the related sales are recognized in accordance with ASC topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers ASC 606 ). 
 
 At the time of sale, the Company reduces recognized gross revenue by allowances to cover, in addition to estimated sales returns as required by ASC 606, (i) sales incentives offered to customers that meet the criteria for accrual and (ii) an estimated amount to recognize additional non-offered deductions it anticipates and can reasonably estimate will be taken by customers, which it does not expect to recover. Accruals for the estimated amount of future non-offered deductions are required to be made as contra-revenue items, because that percentage of shipped revenue fails to meet the collectability criteria within ASC 606. 
 
 If additional marketing support programs, promotions and other volume-based incentives are required to promote the Company s products subsequent to the initial sale, then additional reserves may be required and are accrued for when such support is offered. 
 
 The Company offers limited warranties for its consumer electronics, comparable to those offered to consumers by the Company s competitors in the United States. Such warranties typically consist of a one year period for microwaves and refrigerators and a day period for audio products, under which the Company pays for labor and parts, or offers a new or similar unit in exchange for a non-performing unit. The Company estimates its warranty reserve based on sales and its historical warranty claim rates. 
 
 Licensing : In addition to the distribution of products, the Company grants licenses for the right to access the Company s intellectual property, specifically the Company s trademarks, for a stated term for the manufacture and/or sale of consumer electronics and other products under agreements which require payment of either (i) a non-refundable minimum guaranteed royalty or, (ii) the greater of (a) the actual royalties due (based on a contractual calculation, normally comprised of actual product sales by the licensee multiplied by a stated royalty rate, or Sales Royalties or (b) a minimum guaranteed royalty amount. In the case of the foregoing clause (i), such amounts are recognized as revenue on a straight-line basis over the term of the license agreement. In the case of the foregoing clause (ii), Sales Royalties in excess of guaranteed minimums are accounted for as variable fees and are not recognized as revenue until the Company has ascertained that the licensee s sales of products have exceeded the guaranteed minimum. In effect, the Company recognizes the greater of Sales Royalties earned to date or the straight-line amount of minimum guaranteed royalties to date. In the case where a royalty is paid to the Company in advance, the royalty payment is initially recorded as a liability and recognized as revenue as the royalties are deemed to be earned according to the principles outlined above. As of September 30, 2024, the Company recorded deferred revenue of approximately as compared to approximately as of March 31, 2024 on its condensed consolidated balance sheets. As of September 30, 2023, the Company recorded deferred revenue of nil as compared to approximately as of March 31, 2023 on its condensed consolidated balance sheets. All of the deferred revenue for the periods presented are related to licensing revenue.

 The income of foreign subsidiaries before taxes was for the three month period ended September 30, 2024 as compared to income of foreign subsidiaries before taxes of for the three month period ended September 30, 2023 . The income of foreign subsidiaries before taxes was for the six month period ended September 30, 2024 as compared to income of foreign subsidiaries before taxes of for the six month period ended September 30, 2023 .

Based on the outcome of tax examinations or due to the expiration of statutes of limitations, it is reasonably possible that the unrecognized tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions taken in previously filed returns may be different from the liabilities that have been recorded for these unrecognized tax benefits. As a result, the Company may be subject to additional tax expense. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024 , the Company is asserting under ASC 740 - 30 that all of the unremitted earnings of its foreign subsidiaries are indefinitely invested. The Company evaluates this assertion each period based on a number of factors, including the operating plans, budgets, and forecasts for both the Company and its foreign subsidiaries; the long-term and short-term financial requirements in the U.S. and in each foreign jurisdiction; and the tax consequences of any decision to repatriate earnings of foreign subsidiaries to the U.S.

million to approximately million, inclusive of disgorgement of wrongful profits, attorney's fees and enhanced damages. The aggregate award to the Company also includes the million of advanced deposits previously paid to the Company. The 4.1 million of advanced deposits was reduced by approximately million of incurred legal fees. The remaining balance of million was released by the Company to other income during the quarter ended September 30, 2023. Like any judgement, there is no guarantee that the Company will be able to collect the entire judgement or if it is able to collect, how soon it will be able to do so. The defendants have filed separate bankruptcy petitions in the US Bankruptcy Court for the District of New Jersey, and there is no guarantee that those bankruptcy proceedings will not have any effect on the ability of the Company to collect the judgement. The Company is not currently a party to any other legal proceedings other than litigation matters, in most cases involving ordinary and routine claims incidental to its business. Management cannot estimate with certainty the Company s ultimate legal and financial liability with respect to such pending litigation matters.

Net product sales Net product sales for the three month period ended September 30, 2024 were approximately 2.7 million as compared to approximately 2.4 million for the three month period ended September 30, 2023 , an increase of approximately 0.3 million, or 10.6 . The Company s sales during the three month period ended September 30, 2024 were highly concentrated among its three largest customers Walmart, Amazon, and Fred Meyer comprising in the aggregate approximately 88 of the Company s total net product sales. The Company s sales during the three month period ended September 30, 2023 , were highly concentrated among its three largest customers Walmart, Amazon and Fred Meyer comprising in the aggregate approximately 91 of the Company s total net product sales. 
 
 Net product sales for the six month period ended September 30, 2024 were approximately 4.8 million as compared to approximately 4.1 million for the six month period ended September 30, 2023 , an increase of approximately 0.7 million, or 15.8 . The Company s sales during the six month period ended September 30, 2024 were highly concentrated among its three largest customers Walmart, Amazon and Fred Meyer comprising in the aggregate approximately 86 of the Company s total net product sales. The Company s sales during the six month period ended September 30, 2023 , were highly concentrated among its three largest customers Walmart, Amazon and Fred Meyer comprising in the aggregate approximately 91 of the Company s total net product sales. 
 
 Net product sales are comprised primarily of the sales of houseware and audio products which bear the Emerson brand name. Net product sales may be periodically impacted by adjustments made to the Company s sales allowance and marketing support accrual to record unanticipated customer deductions from accounts receivable or to reduce the accrual by any amounts which were accrued in the past but not taken by customers through deductions from accounts receivable within a certain time period. In the aggregate, these adjustments had the effect of increasing net product sales and operating income by approxim ately 11,000 and 3,000 for the three month periods ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 , respectively, and by approximately 21,000 and 6,000 for the six month periods ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 , respectively. The major elements which contributed to the overall increase in net product sales were as follows: 
 
 i) Houseware products: Net sales of houseware products increased approximately 0.5 million, or 67.5 , to approximately 1.2 million for the three month period ended September 30, 2024 as compared to approximately 0.7 million for the three month period ended September 30, 2023 , driven by increased net sales of newly introduced microwave ovens and refrigerators to the market. Net sales of houseware products increased approximately 0.9 million, or 65.0 , to approximately 2.3 million for the six month period ended September 30, 2024 as compared to approximately 1.4 million for the six month period ended September 30, 2023 , driven by increased net sales of newly introduced microwave ovens and refrigerators to the market. 
 
 ii) Audio products: Net sales of audio products decreased approximately 0.2 million, or 13.4 , to approximately 1.5 million for the three month period ended September 30, 2024 as compared to approximately 1.7 million for the three month period ended September 30, 2023 . Net sales of audio products decreased approximately 0.2 million, or 9.5 , to 2.5 million for the six month period ended September 30, 2024 as compared to approximately 2.7 million for the six month period ended September 30, 2023 . 
 
 Business operations The Company expects to continue to expand its existing distribution channels and to develop and promote new products with retailers in the U.S and Mexico. The Company is also continuing to invest in products and marketing activities to expand its sales through internet and ecommerce channels. These efforts require investments in appropriate human resources, media marketing and development of products in various categories in addition to the traditional home appliances and audio products on which the Company has historically focused. The Company also is continuing its efforts to identify strategic courses of action related to its licensing activities, including seeking new licensing relationships. The Company has engaged each of Leveraged Marketing Corporation of America and Global Licensing Services Pte Limited as an agent to assist in identifying and procuring potential licensees.

Emerson s success is dependent on its ability to anticipate and respond to changing consumer demands and trends in a timely manner, as well as expanding into new markets and sourcing new products that are profitable to the Company. Geo-political factors may also affect the Company s operations and demand for the Company s products, which are subject to customs requirements and to tariffs and quotas set by governments through mutual agreements and bilateral actions. The Company expects that U.S. tariffs on categories of products that the Company imports from China, and China s retaliatory tariffs on certain goods imported from the United States, as well as modifications to international trade policy, will continue to affect its product costs going forward. If no mitigation steps are taken, or the mitigation is unsuccessful, the combination of tariffs will result in significantly increased annualized costs to the Company as all of the Company s products are currently manufactured by suppliers in China. Although the Company is monitoring the trade and political environment and working to mitigate the possible effect of tariffs with its suppliers as well as its customers through pricing and sourcing strategies, the Company cannot be certain how its customers and competitors will react to the actions taken. In addition, heightened tensions between the United States and China over Hong Kong and any resulting retaliatory policies may affect our operations in Hong Kong. At this time the Company is unable to quantify possible effects on its costs arising from the new tariffs, which are expected to increase the Company s inventory costs and associated costs of sales as tariffs are incurred, and some costs may be passed through to the Company s customers as product price increases in the future. However, if the Company is unable to successfully pass through the additional costs or otherwise mitigate the effects of these tariffs, or if the higher prices reduce demand for the Company s products, it will have a negative effect on the Company s product sales and gross margins. 
 
 In light of the adverse macroeconomic conditions domestically and internationally, the Company has implemented certain cost-reduction actions intended to reduce expenditures. However, the environment remains uncertain. Demand for the Company s products remains competitive and requires actions to continue carefully managing inventory. Accordingly, current results and financial condition discussed herein may not be indicative of future operating results and trends.

 Legal Proceedings On October 10, 2023, the US District Court for the District of Delaware granted final judgment in favor of the Company in its trademark infringement lawsuit against air conditioning and heating products provider Emerson Quiet Kool and wholesaler Home Easy (the defendants ). Among other things, the court order issues an injunction and directs the US Patent and Trademark Office to cancel the defendants existing and proposed "Emerson Quiet Kool" trademarks and prohibits defendants from registering or applying to register, or using the same mark or any other mark or name containing the word "Emerson" going forward. The total judgment awarded to the Company has increased from approximately 6.5 million to approximately 10.4 million, inclusive of disgorgement of wrongful profits, attorney's fees and enhanced damages. The aggregate award to the Company also includes the 4.1 million of advanced deposits previously paid to the Company. The 4.1 million of advanced deposits was reduced by approximately 1 million of incurred legal fees. The remaining balance of 3.1 million was released by the Company to other income during the quarter ended September 30, 2023. Like any judgement, there is no guarantee that the Company will be able to collect the entire judgement or if it is able to collect, how soon it will be able to do so. The defendants have filed separate bankruptcy petitions in the US Bankruptcy Court for the District of New Jersey, and there is no guarantee that those bankruptcy proceedings will not have any effect on the ability of the Company to collect the judgement. The Company is not currently a party to any other legal proceedings other than litigation matters, in most cases involving ordinary and routine claims incidental to its business. Management cannot estimate with certainty the Company s ultimate legal and financial liability with respect to such pending litigation matters. However, management believes, based on its examination of such matters, that the Company s ultimate liability will not have a material adverse effect on the Company s financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 
 
 Licensing revenue Licensing revenue for the three month period ended September 30, 2024 was approximately 68,000 as compared to approximately 24,000 for the three month period ended September 30, 2023 , an increase of approximately 44,000, or 183.3 . The increase for the three month period ended September 30, 2024 , was the result of an annual escalation of guaranteed minimum royalties from an ongoing licensee and the revenue earned from a new licensee.

The increase in absolute terms for the three month period ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three month period ended September 30, 2023 was primarily related to an increase in net product sales, increased carrying costs of inventory and the product mix of sales in the current quarter. 
 
 Cost of sales increased approximately 1.0 million, or 27.4 to approximately 4.5 million for the six month period ended September 30, 2024 as compared to approximately 3.5 million for the six month period ended September 30, 2023 . The increase in absolute terms for the six month period ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the six month period ended September 30, 2023 was primarily related to an increase in net product sales, increased carrying costs of inventory and the product mix of sales in the current six month period.

 (a) Disclosure controls and procedures 
 
 The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d 15(e) under the Exchange Act) that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in its Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Due to the inherent limitations of control systems, not all misstatements may be detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the control. Our controls and procedures can only provide reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the above objectives have been met. 
 
 The Company s management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, concluded that disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act), as of September 30, 2024, are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in the reports that the Company files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Company s principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 
 (b) Changes in Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting 
 
 There have been no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
