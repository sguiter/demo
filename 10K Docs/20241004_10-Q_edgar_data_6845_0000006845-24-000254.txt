 Receivables 
 Receivables reflected in the financial statements represent the net amount expected to be collected. An allowance for credit losses is established based on expected losses. Expected losses are estimated by reviewing individual accounts, considering aging, financial condition of the debtor, recent payment history, current and forecasted economic conditions and other relevant factors. Upon billing, aging of receivables is monitored until collection. An account is considered current when it is within agreed upon payment terms. An account is written off when it is determined that the asset is no longer collectible.

 Contract assets and liabilities 
 Contract assets consist of retainage, costs and earnings in excess of billings and other unbilled amounts typically generated when revenue recognized exceeds the amount billed to the customer. Retainage on construction contracts represents amounts withheld by our customers on long-term projects until the project reaches a level of completion where amounts are released to us from the customer. Contract liabilities consist of billings in excess of costs and earnings and other deferred revenue on contracts. 
 
 The time period between when performance obligations are complete and payment is due is not significant. In certain parts of our business that recognize revenue over time, progress billings follow an agreed-upon schedule of values. 
 
 The changes in contract assets and contract liabilities were mainly due to timing of project activity within our businesses that operate under long-term contracts. 
 Revenue recognized related to prior satisfaction of performance obligations 
 
 Some of our contracts have an expected duration of longer than a year, with performance obligations extending over that time frame. Generally, these contracts are found in our businesses that typically operate with long-term contracts, which recognize revenue over time.

 Derivative instruments 
 We periodically use interest rate swaps, currency put options, and forward purchase contracts to manage risks generally associated with foreign exchange rate, interest rate and commodity price fluctuations. The information that follows explains the various types of derivatives and financial instruments we use, how such instruments are accounted for, and how such instruments impact our financial position and performance. 
 
 In fiscal 2020, we entered into an interest rate swap to hedge exposure to variability in cash flows from interest payments on floating-rate borrowings under our credit facility. As of August 31, 2024, the interest rate swap contract had a notional value of million and has a maturity date of February 5, 2026. 
 
 We periodically enter into forward purchase contracts and/or fixed/floating swaps to manage the risk associated with fluctuations in aluminum prices and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. These contracts generally have an original maturity date of less than one year. As of August 31, 2024, we held aluminum purchase contracts and foreign exchange option contracts with U.S. dollar notional values of million and million, respectively. 
 
 The mark to market adjustments on these derivative instruments are recorded within our consolidated balance sheets within other current assets and other current liabilities. Gains or losses associated with these instruments are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss until which time the hedged transaction is settled and gains or losses are reclassified to net earnings.

 million, in which commitments are available through a million, revolving credit facility and a committed million delayed draw term loan facility. Borrowings under the revolving credit facility can be in Canadian dollars (CAD) limited to million USD. The term loan facility may be borrowed in up to drawdowns, which are available to be made within after the closing date. The senior credit facility has a term of with a maturity date of July 19, 2029. Outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility were million as of August 31, 2024. As of August 31, 2024, the term loan facility had been drawn. 
 
 The Credit Agreement replaces the previous revolving credit facility with Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, and other lenders, with maximum borrowings up to million, and the Canadian credit facilities with Bank of Montreal totaling million USD. Outstanding borrowings under the previous revolving credit facility were million as of March 2, 2024. We had outstanding borrowings under the Canadian facilities as of March 2, 2024. 
 
 As a result of the transaction, in the second quarter of fiscal 2025, we recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt within interest expense of million for the write-off of unamortized financing fees related to the previous revolving credit facility. Additionally, we capitalized million of lender fees and million of third-party fees incurred in connection with the Credit Agreement, which were recorded as other non-current assets and will be amortized over the term of the credit facility as interest expense. 
 
 The Credit Agreement contains two maintenance financial covenants that require our Consolidated Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement) to be less than and our Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement) to exceed . At August 31, 2024, we were in compliance with all covenants as defined under the terms of the Credit Agreement. 
 
 The Credit Agreement also contains an acquisition holiday. In the event we make an acquisition for which the purchase price is greater than million, we can elect to increase the maximum Consolidated Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement) to for a period of four consecutive fiscal quarters, commencing with the fiscal quarter in which a qualifying acquisition occurs. No more than acquisition holidays can occur during the term of the Credit Agreement, and at least fiscal quarters must separate qualifying acquisitions.

 The Credit Agreement also contains an accordion provision. Under this provision, we can request that the senior credit facility be increased by unlimited additional amounts. Any lender may elect or decline to participate in the requested increase at their sole discretion. 
 
 At August 31, 2024, we had a total of million of ongoing letters of credit related to the senior credit facility and industrial revenue bonds, construction contracts and insurance collateral that expire in fiscal years 2026 through 2032 and reduce borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility. As of August 31, 2024, the amount available for revolving borrowings was million. 
 
 At August 31, 2024, debt included million of industrial revenue bonds that mature in fiscal years 2036 through 2043. 
 
 The fair value of our senior credit facility and industrial revenue bonds approximated carrying values at August 31, 2024, and would be classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy described in Note 4, due to the variable interest rates on these instruments.

We have never been required to make payments under surety or performance bonds with respect to our existing businesses. 
 
 Warranty and project-related contingencies 
 We reserve estimated exposures on known claims, as well as on a portion of anticipated claims, for product warranty and rework cost, based on historical product liability claims as a ratio of sales. Claim costs are deducted from the accrual when paid. Factors that could have an impact on these accruals in any given period include changes in manufacturing quality, changes in product mix, and any significant changes in sales volume.

 New Markets Tax Credit (NMTC) transactions 
 We have outstanding NMTC arrangements which help to support operational expansion. Proceeds received from investors on these transactions are included within other non-current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. The NMTC arrangements are subject to 100 percent tax credit recapture for a period of seven years from the date of each respective transaction. Upon the termination of each arrangement, these proceeds will be recognized in earnings in exchange for the transfer of tax credits. The direct and incremental costs incurred in structuring these arrangements have been deferred and are included in other non-current assets in our consolidated balance sheets. These costs will be recognized in conjunction with the recognition of the related proceeds on each arrangement. During the construction phase or for working capital purposes for each project, we are required to hold cash dedicated to fund each project, which is classified as restricted cash in our consolidated balance sheets. As a result of the structure of these transactions, variable-interest entities were created. As the other investors in these programs do not have a material interest in the entities' underlying economics, we include 100 of the results of the variable-interest entities in our consolidated financial statements.

 Litigation 
 The Company is a party to various legal proceedings incidental to its normal operating activities. In particular, like others in the construction supply and services industry, the Company is routinely involved in various disputes and claims arising out of construction projects, sometimes involving significant monetary damages or product replacement. We have in the past and are currently subject to product liability and warranty claims, including certain legal claims related to a commercial sealant product formerly incorporated into our products. In December 2022, the claimant in an arbitration of one such claim was awarded million. The Company has appealed the award and believes, after taking into account all currently available information, including the advice of counsel and the likelihood of available insurance coverage, that this award will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. The Company is also subject to litigation arising out of areas such as employment practices, workers compensation and general liability matters. Although it is very difficult to accurately predict the outcome of any such proceedings, facts currently available indicate that no matters will result in losses that would have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, cash flows or financial condition of the Company.

 During fiscal 2004, the Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program allowing us to repurchase shares of our outstanding common stock, with subsequent increases in authorization. During the six-months ended August 31, 2024, we repurchased shares under the program, for a total cost of million, inclusive of the applicable excise tax. During the six-months ended August 26, 2023, we repurchased shares under the program, for a total cost of million. We have repurchased a total of shares, at a total cost of million, since the inception of this program in fiscal 2004. We have remaining authority to repurchase shares under this program, which has no expiration date. We may also elect to repurchase additional shares of common stock under our authorization, subject to limitations contained in our debt agreements and based upon our assessment of a number of factors, including share price, trading volume and general market conditions, working capital requirements, general business conditions, financial conditions, any applicable contractual limitations, and other factors, including alternative investment opportunities. We may finance share repurchases with available cash, additional debt or other sources of financing.

Segment operating income includes operating income related to intersegment sales transactions and excludes certain corporate costs that are not allocated at a segment level. We report these unallocated corporate costs in Corporate and Other. Operating income does not include other income or expense, interest expense or income tax expense.

 Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

Forward-looking statements 
 This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including the section, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, contains certain statements that are considered forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements reflect our current views with respect to future events and financial performance. Forward-looking statements generally can be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology such as may, believe, expect, anticipate, intend, estimate, forecast, project, should, will, continue or similar words or expressions. All forecasts and projections in this document are forward-looking statements, and are based on management s current expectations or beliefs of the Company's near-term results, based on current information available pertaining to the Company. From time to time, we may also provide oral and written forward-looking statements in other materials we release to the public, such as press releases, presentations to securities analysts or investors, or other communications by the Company. Any or all of our forward-looking statements in this report and in any public statements we make could be materially different from actual results. 
 
 Accordingly, we wish to caution investors that any forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of the Company are subject to uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from such statements. These uncertainties and other risk factors include, but are not limited to, the risks and uncertainties set forth under Risk Factors section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 2, 2024 and in subsequent filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, including this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 
 We also wish to caution investors that other factors might in the future prove to be important in affecting the Company s results of operations. New factors emerge from time to time; it is not possible for management to predict all such factors, nor can it assess the impact of each such factor on the business or the extent to which any factor, or a combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. We undertake no obligation to update publicly or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. 
 
 Non-GAAP Measures 
 We have included in this report measures of financial performance that are not defined by U.S. GAAP. We believe that these measures provide useful information and include these measures in other communications to investors. For each of these non-GAAP financial measures, we provide a reconciliation of the differences between the non-GAAP measure and the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure (see Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures in this Item 2 below), and an explanation of why we believe the non-GAAP measure provides useful information to management and investors. These non-GAAP measures should be viewed in addition to, and not in lieu of, the comparable U.S. GAAP measure.

 We are a leading provider of architectural products and services for enclosing buildings, and high-performance glass and acrylic products used in applications for preservation, protection and enhanced viewing. Our four reporting segments are: Architectural Framing Systems, Architectural Glass, Architectural Services and Large-Scale Optical (LSO). 
 
 Our enterprise strategy is based on the following three key elements: 
 1. Become the economic leader in our target markets. We are developing a deep understanding of our target markets and aligning our businesses with clear go-to-market strategies to drive value for our customers through differentiated product and service offerings. We are focused on operational execution, driving productivity improvements, and maintaining a competitive cost structure, so that we may bring more value to our customers and improve our own profitability. 
 2. Actively manage our portfolio to drive higher margins and returns. We are shifting our business mix toward higher operating margin offerings in order to improve our return on invested capital performance. We expect to accomplish this by allocating resources to grow our top performing businesses, actively addressing underperforming businesses, and investing to add new differentiated product and service offerings to accelerate our growth and increase margins. 
 3. Strengthen our core capabilities. We are shifting from our historical, decentralized operating model to one with center-led functional expertise that enables us to leverage the scale of the enterprise to better support the needs of the business. In fiscal 2022, we established a Company-wide operating system with common tools and processes based on the foundation of Lean and Continuous Improvement, which we call the Apogee Management System. Our strategy is supported by a robust talent management program and a commitment to strong governance to ensure compliance and drive sustainable performance.

Table of Contents 

 We set this strategy by developing a deep knowledge of the markets we serve and by gaining extensive input from customers and industry influencers, along with detailed competitive benchmarking. We continually analyze our portfolio of products, services, and capabilities to identify the best areas for future profitable growth. We also evaluate our operating model to ensure we have the organizational structure and capabilities needed to deliver consistent profitable growth. Through this work, we validate strengths that we can leverage and identify opportunities to improve our performance. 
 
 In fiscal 2024 and through the second quarter of fiscal 2025, we drove further progress toward our strategic goals and financial targets. We continued the deployment of the Apogee Management System across our business, supporting sustainable cost and productivity improvements. We invested in organic growth initiatives, including capacity expansion in the Large-Scale Optical Segment and geographic growth in the Architectural Services Segment. We increased our focus on differentiated products and services, and continued to diversify the mix of architectural projects that we serve while leaning more heavily into higher, value-added products. We also advanced several initiatives to strengthen our core capabilities, driving the standardization of key business processes and systems, and strengthening talent management and leadership development programs.

 Comparison of Second Quarter Fiscal 2025 to Second Quarter Fiscal 2024 
 Consolidated net sales decreased 3.2 , to 342.4 million, primarily driven by lower volume, partially offset by improved pricing and mix. 
 
 Gross margin increased to 28.4 , compared to 27.0 , primarily driven by improved pricing, a more favorable mix of projects in Architectural Services, favorable material costs, and lower insurance-related costs, partially offset by the unfavorable sales leverage impact of lower volume, higher compensation and benefits expense, and 0.9 million of restructuring costs associated with Project Fortify. 
 
 Selling, general and administrative (SG A) expenses increased 0.5 million to 16.2 of net sales, compared to 15.5 of net sales. The increase in SG A as a percentage of sales was primarily due to higher incentive compensation expense and the unfavorable sales leverage impact of lower volume. 
 
 Operating income increased to 42.0 million from 40.6 million, and operating margin increased 80 basis points to 12.3 . The improvement in operating margin was primarily driven by improved pricing, a more favorable mix of projects in Architectural Services, favorable material costs, and lower insurance-related costs, partially offset by the impact of higher incentive compensation expense, 1.2 million of restructuring costs related to Project Fortify, and the unfavorable sales leverage impact of lower volume. Adjusted operating income grew 6.4 t o 43.1 million, and adjusted operating margin improved to 12.6 . 
 
 Interest expense, net was 1.1 million, compared to 2.2 million, primarily driven by lower average debt levels, partially offset by the impact of the write-off of unamortized financing fees related to the previous credit facility. 
 
 Income tax expense as a percentage of earnings before income tax was 25.7 , compared to 22.9 for the same period last year. The increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due to an increase in tax expense for discrete items. 
 
 Comparison of First Six Months of Fiscal 2025 to First Six Months of Fiscal 2024 
 
 Consolidated net sales decreased 5.8 , to 674.0 million, primarily driven by lower volume, partially offset by improved pricing and mix. 
 
 Gross margin increased to 29.1 , compared to 26.3 , primarily driven by improved pricing and a more favorable mix of projects in Architectural Services, favorable material costs, and lower insurance-related costs, partially offset by the unfavorable sales leverage impact of lower volume, higher compensation and benefits expense, and 1.5 million of restructuring costs associated with Project Fortify. 
 
 SG A expenses decreased 1.2 million to 16.7 of net sales, compared to 15.9 of net sales. The increase in SG A as a percentage of sales was primarily due to the unfavorable sales leverage impact of lower volume and higher incentive compensation expense, partially offset by lower bad debt expense. 
 
 Operating income grew to 83.3 million from 74.3 million, and operating margin increased 200 basis points to 12.4 . The improvement in operating margin was primarily driven by improved pricing, a more favorable mix of projects in Architectural Services, favorable material costs, lower insurance-related costs, and lower bad debt expense, which more than offset the unfavorable sales leverage impact of lower volume, 2.3 million of restructuring costs related to Project Fortify, and higher incentive compensation expense. Adjusted operating income grew 15.2 to 85.6 million, and adjusted operating margin improved to 12.7 . 
 
 Interest expense, net was 1.6 million, compared to 4.3 million, primarily driven by lower average debt levels, partially offset by the impact of the write-off of unamortized financing fees related to our previous credit facility. 
 
 Income tax expense as a percentage of earnings before income tax was 25.1 , compared to 23.8 for the same period last year. The increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due to an increase in tax expense for discrete items.

 Segment net sales is defined as net sales for a certain segment and includes revenue related to intersegment transactions. We report net sales intersegment eliminations separately to exclude these sales from our consolidated total. Segment operating income is equal to net sales, less cost of goods sold, SG A, and any asset impairment charges associated with the segment. Segment operating income includes operating income related to intersegment sales transactions and excludes certain corporate costs that are not allocated at a segment level. We report these unallocated corporate costs in Corporate and Other. Operating income does not include other income or expense, interest expense or income tax expense. 
 
 Architectural Framing Systems 
 Comparison of Second Quarter Fiscal 2025 to Second Quarter Fiscal 2024

 Corporate and Other 
 Comparison of Second Quarter Fiscal 2025 to Second Quarter Fiscal 2024 
 Corporate and Other expense was 6.2 million, compared to 6.1 million. The increase was primarily driven by higher incentive compensation and benefits costs, partially offset by lower insurance-related costs. 
 
 Comparison of First Six Months of Fiscal 2025 to First Six Months of Fiscal 2024 
 Corporate and Other expense was 10.7 million, compared to 13.8 million, primarily due to lower insurance-related costs, partially offset by incentive compensation and benefits costs. 
 
 Backlog 
 Backlog represents the dollar amount of signed contracts or firm orders, generally as a result of a competitive bidding process, which may be expected to be recognized as revenue in the future. Backlog is most meaningful for Architectural Services due to the longer-term nature of their projects. Backlog is not a term defined under U.S. GAAP and is not a measure of contract profitability. We view backlog as one indicator of future revenues, particularly in our longer-lead time businesses. In addition to backlog, we have a substantial amount of projects with short lead times that book-and-bill within the same reporting period and are not included in backlog. 
 
 Architectural Services 
 As of August 31, 2024, segment backlog was approximately 792.1 million, compared to approximately 866.9 million at the end of the prior quarter. The decrease in backlog compared to the prior quarter was primarily driven by executing more project work in the quarter than securing new project awards that were added to backlog. Our backlog in this segment tends to vary significantly given the variable timing and relatively large size of projects awarded. 

Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 
 Adjusted operating income, adjusted operating margin, adjusted net earnings, adjusted diluted earnings per share (adjusted diluted EPS), adjusted net earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (adjusted EBITDA), and adjusted EBITDA margin are supplemental non-GAAP financial measures provided by the Company to assess performance on a more comparable basis from period-to-period by excluding amounts that management does not consider part of core operating results. Management uses these non-GAAP measures as noted below: 
 
 We use adjusted operating income, adjusted operating margin, adjusted net earnings, and adjusted diluted EPS to provide meaningful supplemental information about our operating performance by excluding amounts that are not considered part of core operating results to enhance comparability of results from period to period. 
 We believe adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin metrics provide useful information to investors and analysts about our core operating performance. 
 
 These non-GAAP measures should be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative to, the reported financial results of the Company prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Other companies may calculate these measures differently, thereby limiting the usefulness of the measures for comparison with other companies.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 We rely on cash provided by operations for our material cash requirements, including working capital needs, capital expenditures, satisfaction of contractual commitments (including principal and interest payments on our outstanding indebtedness) and shareholder return through dividend payments and share repurchases. 
 
 Operating Activities. Net cash provided by operating activities was 64.1 million for the first six months of fiscal 2025, compared to 62.6 million in the prior year period. The increase was primarily driven by increased net earnings and decreased cash payments for incentive compensation, partially offset by increased cash used for working capital. 
 
 Investing Activities. Net cash used by investing activities was 15.5 million for the first six months of fiscal 2025, compared to 15.1 million in the prior year, primarily related to capital expenditures in both periods. 
 
 Financing Activities. Net cash used by financing activities was 34.6 million for the first six months of fiscal 2025, compared to 50.1 million in the prior year period. The decrease in cash used for financing activities was primarily driven by lower net debt repayments, partially offset by debt issuance costs related to our new credit agreement and increased share repurchases. 
 
 Additional Liquidity Considerations. We periodically evaluate our liquidity requirements, cash needs and availability of debt resources relative to acquisition plans, significant capital plans, and other working capital needs. 
 
 On July 19, 2024, we entered into a Credit Agreement (the Credit Agreement) with Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent, and other lenders. The Credit Agreement provides for an unsecured senior credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to 700.0 million, in which commitments are available through a 450.0 million, five-year revolving credit facility and a committed 250.0 million delayed draw term loan facility. Borrowings under the revolving credit facility can be in Canadian dollars (CAD) limited to 25.0 million USD. The term loan facility may be borrowed in up to two drawdowns, which are available to be made within one year after the closing date. The senior credit facility has a term of five years with a maturity date of July 19, 2029. Outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility were 50.0 million as of August 31, 2024. As of August 31, 2024, the term loan facility had not been drawn. 
 
 The Credit Agreement replaces the previous revolving credit facility with Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, and other lenders, with maximum borrowings up to 385.0 million, and the two Canadian credit facilities with Bank of Montreal totaling 25.0 million USD. Outstanding borrowings under the previous revolving credit facility were 50.0 million as of March 2, 2024. We had no outstanding borrowings under the Canadian facilities as of March 2, 2024. 
 
 As a result of the transaction, in the second quarter of fiscal 2025, we recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt within interest expense of 0.5 million for the write-off of unamortized financing fees related to the previous revolving credit facility. Additionally, we capitalized 3.0 million of lender fees and 0.6 million of third-party fees incurred in connection with the Credit Agreement, which were recorded as other non-current assets and will be amortized over the term of the credit facility as interest expense. 
 
 The Credit Agreement contains two maintenance financial covenants that require our Consolidated Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement) to be less than 3.50 and our Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement) to exceed 3.00. At August 31, 2024, we were in compliance with all covenants as defined under the terms of the Credit Agreement. 
 
 The Credit Agreement also contains an acquisition holiday. In the event we make an acquisition for which the purchase price is greater than 75 million, we can elect to increase the maximum Consolidated Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement) to 4.00 for a period of four consecutive fiscal quarters, commencing with the fiscal quarter in which a qualifying acquisition occurs. No more than two acquisition holidays can occur during the term of the Credit Agreement, and at least two fiscal quarters must separate qualifying acquisitions. 
 
 Borrowings under the Credit Agreement bear floating interest at either the Base Rate or Term Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR), or for CAD borrowings, Canadian Overnight Repo Rate Average (CORRA) plus, in each a margin based on the Consolidated Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement). For Base Rate borrowings, the margin ranges from 0.25 to 0.75 . For Term SOFR and CORRA borrowings, the margin ranges from 1.25 to 1.75 , with an incremental Term SOFR and CORRA adjustment of 0.10 and 0.29547 respectively. 
 
 The Credit Agreement also contains an accordion provision. Under this provision, we can request that the senior credit facility be increased by unlimited additional amounts. Any lender may elect or decline to participate in the requested increase at their sole discretion.

 At August 31, 2024, we had a total of 42.5 million of ongoing letters of credit related to the senior credit facility and industrial revenue bonds, construction contracts and insurance collateral that expire in fiscal years 2026 through 2032 and reduce borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility. As of August 31, 2024, the amount available for revolving borrowings was 357.5 million. 
 
 We acquire the use of certain assets through operating leases, such as property, manufacturing equipment, vehicles and other equipment. Future payments for such leases, excluding leases with initial terms of one year or less, were 48.1 million at August 31, 2024, with 7.1 million payable during the remainder of fiscal 2025. 
 
 As of August 31, 2024, we had 14.2 million of open purchase obligations, of which payments totaling 9.3 million are expected to become due during the remainder of fiscal 2025. These purchase obligations primarily relate to raw material commitments and capital expenditures and are not expected to impact future liquidity, as amounts should be recovered through customer billings. 
 
 We expect to make contributions of 0.4 million to our defined-benefit pension plans in fiscal 2025, which will equal or exceed our minimum funding requirements. 
 
 As of August 31, 2024, we had reserves of 5.6 million for unrecognized tax benefits. We are unable to reasonably estimate in which future periods the remaining unrecognized tax benefits will ultimately be settled. 
 
 We are required, in the ordinary course of business, to provide surety or performance bonds that commit payments to our customers for any non-performance. At August 31, 2024, 1.2 billion of these types of bonds were outstanding, of which 366.0 million is in our backlog. These bonds have expiration dates that align with completion of the purchase order or contract. We have not been required to make any payments under these bonds with respect to our existing businesses. 
 
 Due to our ability to generate strong cash from operations and our borrowing capability under our committed revolving credit facility, we believe that our sources of liquidity will be adequate to meet our short-term and long-term liquidity and capital expenditure needs. In addition, we believe we have the ability to obtain both short-term and long-term debt to meet our financing needs, including additional sources of debt to finance potential acquisitions, for the foreseeable future. We also believe we will be able to operate our business so as to continue to be in compliance with our existing debt covenants over the next fiscal year. 
 
 We continually review our portfolio of businesses and their assets and how they support our business strategy and performance objectives. As part of this review, we may acquire other businesses, pursue geographic expansion, take actions to manage capacity and further invest in, divest and/or sell parts of our current businesses. 

Related Party Transactions

 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 a) Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures: As of the end of the period covered by this report (the Evaluation Date), we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act)). Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of the Evaluation Date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in applicable rules and forms, and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 b) Changes in internal controls: There was no change in the Company s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fiscal quarter ended August 31, 2024, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting. 

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 
 The Company is a party to various legal proceedings incidental to its normal operating activities. In particular, like others in the construction supply and services industry, the Company is routinely involved in various disputes and claims arising out of construction projects, sometimes involving significant monetary damages or product replacement. We have in the past and are currently subject to product liability and warranty claims, including certain legal claims related to a commercial sealant product formerly incorporated into our products. In December 2022, the claimant in an arbitration of one such claim was awarded 20 million. The Company has appealed the award and believes, after taking into account all currently available information, including the advice of counsel and the likelihood of available insurance coverage, that this award will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. The Company is also subject to litigation arising out of areas such as employment practices, workers compensation and general liability matters. Although it is very difficult to accurately predict the outcome of any such proceedings, facts currently available indicate that no matters will result in losses that would have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, cash flows or financial condition of the Company. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 There have been no material changes or additions to our risk factors discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 2, 2024.
