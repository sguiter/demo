 in the patterns described above. Pricing is fixed with the customer. With respect to lease and non-lease components, the Company adopted the practical expedient to account for the arrangement as a single lease component.

Introduction, Outlook and Overview of Business Operations

STRATA Skin Sciences is a medical technology company in dermatology dedicated to developing, commercializing, and marketing innovative products for the treatment of dermatologic conditions. Its products include the
 XTRAC and Pharos excimer lasers and VTRAC lamp systems utilized in the treatment of psoriasis, vitiligo, and various other skin conditions, as well as the TheraClear X Acne Therapy System utilized in the treatment of acne-related skin
 conditions.

Table of Contents 

The XTRAC ultraviolet light excimer laser system is utilized to treat psoriasis, vitiligo, and other skin diseases. The XTRAC excimer laser system received clearance from the FDA in 2000 and has since become a widely
 recognized treatment among dermatologists. The system delivers targeted 308nm ultraviolet light to affected areas of skin, leading to psoriasis clearing and vitiligo repigmentation, following a series of treatments. As of September 30, 2024 , there were 873 XTRAC systems placed in dermatologists offices in the United States under our dermatology recurring procedures model, a
 decrease from 923 as of December 31, 2023 . Under the dermatology recurring procedures model, the XTRAC system is placed in a physician s office and fees are
 charged on a per procedure basis or a fee is charged on a periodic basis not to exceed an agreed upon number of procedures. The XTRAC system s use for psoriasis is covered by nearly all major insurance companies, including Medicare. The VTRAC
 Excimer Lamp system, offered internationally in addition to the XTRAC, provides targeted therapeutic efficacy demonstrated by excimer technology with the simplicity of design and reliability of a lamp system. The Pharos excimer laser system holds
 FDA clearance to treat chronic skin diseases, including psoriasis, vitiligo, atopic dermatitis, and leukoderma. We believe there are approximately 8 million people in the United States and up to 125 million people worldwide suffering from
 psoriasis, and 1 to 2 of the world s population suffers from vitiligo.

The TheraClear X Acne Therapy System combines intense pulse light with vacuum (suction) for the treatment of mild to moderate inflammatory acne (including acne vulgaris), comedonal acne and pustular acne. The
 TheraClear device was cleared by the FDA through the 510(k) process. Currently, there is little insurance reimbursement coverage for acne treatments, such as those provided by TheraClear. 

Our non-U.S. business focuses on a direct distribution model for equipment sales and recurring revenue, and we have distribution agreements in place in the Mid-East, Asia, and Mexico.

Post-COVID-19 Pandemic

In late 2019, there was an outbreak of a new strain of coronavirus COVID-19 which became a global pandemic. Since March 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted business conditions in the industry in
 which we operate, disrupted global supply chains, constrained workforce participation, and created significant volatility and disruption of financial markets. The pandemic led to the suspension of elective procedures in the U.S. and to the
 temporary closure of many physician practices, which are our primary customers. While most physician offices have reopened, some of our partner physician practices closed permanently, and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and its variants on our
 operational and financial performance, including our ability to execute our business strategies and initiatives in the expected time frames is ongoing. We will continue to identify and plan around potential future pandemics and disruptions to our
 business.

Impact of Russia-Ukraine War

Prior to the outbreak of the Russia-Ukraine War, Ukraine was the largest exporter of noble gases including neon, krypton, and xenon and has historically been the source of a significant amount of gas supplied to us
 by our contract suppliers. Neon gas is essential to the proper functioning of our lasers. Our suppliers have been resourceful in continuing to supply gases to us but cannot assure us that the supply will not remain uninterrupted. The reduced supply
 and ongoing conflict have also impacted the price of gas worldwide. Additionally, the Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors and Science Act of 2022 has led to a further tightening of rare gas supplies as semiconductor chip
 manufacturers reconfigure their supply chains to address the need to secure their own supplies of rare gases for use in the manufacture of computer chips.

Impact of Middle East Conflict

We have not seen an impact on our distributors businesses in the Middle East due to the Middle East conflict, but cannot predict the impact should the conflict continue or develop into a larger war.

Key Technologies

XTRAC Excimer Laser. XTRAC received FDA clearance in 2000 and has since become a widely recognized treatment among dermatologists for
 psoriasis and other skin diseases. The XTRAC System delivers ultra-narrowband ultraviolet B UVB light to affected areas of skin. Following a series of
 treatments typically performed twice weekly, psoriasis remission can be achieved, and vitiligo patches can be re-pigmented. XTRAC is endorsed by the National Psoriasis Foundation, and its use for psoriasis is covered by nearly all major
 insurance companies, including Medicare. We estimate that more than half of all major insurance companies now offer reimbursement for vitiligo as well, a figure that is increasing. 

In the third quarter of 2018, we announced the FDA granted clearance for our Multi Micro Dose (MMD) tip for our XTRAC excimer laser. The MMD Tip accessory is indicated for use in conjunction with the XTRAC laser system to filter the
 Narrow Band UVB NB-UVB light at delivery in order to calculate and individualize the maximum non-blistering dose for a particular patient.

In January 2020, we announced the FDA granted clearance of our XTRAC Momentum Excimer Laser Platform. In February 2022, we announced the commercial launch, with the first installation in the U.S.
 market, of our next generation excimer laser system, XTRAC Momentum 1.0. 

VTRAC Lamp. VTRAC received FDA clearance in 2005 and provides targeted therapeutic efficacy demonstrated by excimer technology with the
 simplicity of design and reliability of a lamp system. 

TheraClear X Acne Treatment Device. The TheraClear Acne Therapy System TheraClear combines intense pulse light with vacuum (suction) for the
 treatment of mild to moderate inflammatory acne (including acne vulgaris), comedonal acne and pustular acne.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

There have been no changes to our critical accounting policies in the three months ended September 30, 2024 . Critical accounting
 policies and the significant estimates made in accordance with such policies are regularly discussed with our Audit Committee. Those policies are discussed under Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates, as well as in our consolidated financial
 statements and the footnotes thereto, included in the 2023 10-K.

Dermatology Recurring Procedures

Recognized recurring treatment revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 5,381, which we estimate is approximately 64,000 XTRAC treatments with prices between 65
 to 95 per treatment, compared to recognized recurring treatment revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2023 of 5,280, which we estimate is approximately 70,000 XTRAC treatments with prices between 65 to 95 per treatment. 
 Recognized recurring treatment revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 15,416 , which we estimate is approximately 188,000 XTRAC treatments with prices between 65 to 95 per treatment, compared to recognized recurring treatment revenue for the nine months ended September
 30, 2023 of 15,945 , which we estimate is approximately 210,000 XTRAC treatments with prices between 65 to 95 per treatment. In connection with the launch of
 TheraClear, there were 135 and 76 TheraClear devices placed in dermatologists offices in the United States under our recurring procedures model as of September 30, 2024 and 2023 , respectively. Nominal revenue was earned from these devices during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 .

Table of Contents 

Increases in procedures are dependent upon building market acceptance through marketing programs with our physician partners and their patients to show that the XTRAC procedures will be of clinical benefit and will
 be generally reimbursed by insurers. We believe that several factors have an impact on the prescribed use of XTRAC treatments for psoriasis and vitiligo patients. Specifically, we believe that there is a lack of awareness of the positive effects of
 XTRAC treatments among both sufferers and providers; and the treatment regimen, which can sometimes require up to 12 or more treatments, has limited XTRAC use to certain patient populations. We reduced our direct-to-patient advertising over the
 course of 2023, which we believe contributed to a reduction in the number of XTRAC treatments compared to prior periods that continued into 2024. Therefore, our strategy going forward is to increase our direct-to-patient program for XTRAC
 advertising in the United States, targeting psoriasis and vitiligo patients through a variety of media and through our use of social media such as Facebook and X (formerly Twitter). We monitor the results of our advertising expenditures in this
 area in order to effectively reach the more than 10 million patients in the United States we believe are afflicted with these diseases.

Revenues from dermatology recurring procedures are recognized over the estimated usage period of the agreed upon number of treatments, as the treatments are being used. As of September
 30, 2024 and 2023 , we deferred domestic net revenues of 1,943 and 1,947 , respectively, which will be recognized as revenue
 over the remaining usage period for the related placements. Lower deferred revenue from the fourth quarter of 2023 negatively impacted the first quarter of 2024 as compared to the first quarter of 2023, when higher
 deferred revenue from the fourth quarter of 2022 positively impacted that period. 

Dermatology Procedures Equipment

For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , dermatology procedures equipment revenues were 3,416 
 and 8,570 , respectively. Internationally, we sold 20 systems 20 XTRAC and nil VTRAC) and 60 systems 56 XTRAC and 4 VTRAC), respectively, during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 . Domestically, there were 7 and 12 XTRAC systems sold, respectively, during the three and
 nine months ended September 30, 2024 . In addition to equipment sales, we recognized approximately 53 of previously deferred
 service revenue associated with assumed service contracts from Ra Medical during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 .

For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 , dermatology procedures equipment revenues were 3,572 
 and 8,724 , respectively. Internationally, we sold 21 systems 19 XTRAC and 2 VTRAC) and 51 systems 44 XTRAC and 7 VTRAC), respectively, during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 . Domestically, there were 6 and 20 XTRAC systems sold, respectively, during the three and
 nine months ended September 30, 2023 . In addition to equipment sales, we recognized approximately 45 and 185 of previously
 deferred service revenue associated with assumed service contracts from Ra Medical during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 , respectively.

The increase in gross profit percentage compared to the same period in the prior
 year was prima rily the result of lower amortization costs due to the write-down of the technology intangible asset for the TheraClear devices in the fourth quarter of 2023 in connection with the revaluation of
 the contingent consideration related to the TheraClear asset acquisition and the sale of refurbished units that have a lower cost of revenues than building new units as part of our stated plan to remove devices from underperforming accounts,
 partially offset by increased maintenance costs largely driven by TheraClear devices placed into service.

Gross profit decreased to 13,324 for the nine months ended September

As a percentage of revenues, gross profit was 55.5 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , as compared to 55.4 for the same period in 2023 . The increase in gross profit percentage compared to the same period in the prior year was primarily the result of lower amortization costs due to the write-down of the technology intangible asset for the TheraClear
 devices in the fourth quarter of 2023 in connection with the revaluation of the contingent consideration related to the TheraClear asset acquisition and a decrease in domestic sales with longer warranty periods, leading to a lower amount of
 deferred revenue for those sales, partially offset by the result of less deferred revenue from the fourth quarter of 2023 recognized in 2024 compared to higher deferred revenue from the fourth quarter of 2022 recognized in 2023, higher depreciation
 costs due to more XTRAC lasers and TheraClear devices placed into service, a reduction in service billings and the write-off of inventories related to Pharos laser system products that will no longer be needed for warranty purposes due to the
 expiration of the related warranty service contracts, and a discount on the sale of certain lasers to an international distributor.

Engineering and Product Developmen t

For the three months ended September 30, 2024 , engineering and product development expenses were 243 as compared to 248 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 . Engineering and product development costs were lower during the three-month period in 2024 primarily
 as a result of a decrease in salaries and outside services.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , engineering and product development expenses were 683 as
 compared to 937 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 . Engineering and product development costs were lower during the nine -month period in 2024 primarily as a result of a decrease in salaries and outside services.

Selling and Marketing Expenses

For the three months ended September 30, 2024 , selling and marketing expenses were 3,048 as
 compared to 3,038 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 . Selling and marketing expenses were higher during the three-month period in 2024 
 primarily as a result of an increase in commissions in the same period, rehiring for certain positions that were previously terminated and our direct to patient advertising campaign aimed at motivating psoriasis and vitiligo patients to seek out
 XTRAC treatments from our physician partners, partially offset by a decrease in salaries and other employee related expenses due to the reduction in the size of the sales force.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , selling and marketing expenses were 9,080 as compared to
 10,196 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 . Selling and marketing expenses were lower during the nine -month period in 2024 primarily as a result of a decrease in salaries and other employee related expenses due to the reduction in the size of the sales force, 
 as well as a decrease in commissions due to the decrease in revenues, partially offset by an increase due to our direct to patient advertising campaign aimed at motivating psoriasis and vitiligo patients to seek out XTRAC treatments from
 our physician partners.

General and Administrative Expenses

For the three months ended September 30, 2024 , general and administrative expenses were 3,669 as compared to 2,283 
 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 . General and administrative expenses were higher during the three-month period in 2024 primarily as a result of an increase in
 our sales tax accrual (see Note 14 , Commitments and Contingencies to the Notes to unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements), partially offset by lower
 stock-based compensation expense and a decrease in the allowance for credit losses.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , general and administrative expenses were 8,589 as
 compared to 7,690 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 . General and administrative expenses were higher during the nine -month period in 2024 primarily as a result of an increase in our sales tax accrual (see Note 14 , Commitments

and Contingencies to the Notes to unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements) and certain employee related expenses, partially offset by lower stock-based compensation expense, lower accounting and legal expenses and a decrease
 in the allowance for credit losses.

Loss on Debt Extinguishment

During the second quarter of 2023, we refinanced our Senior Term Facility with MidCap (see Note 8 , Long-term Debt to the Notes to
 unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements) (the Senior Term Facility ). The new loan was considered substantially different from the original loan and, as such, we recorded a loss on debt extinguishment of 909 during the nine months ended June 30, 2023. During the first quarter of 2024, we amended the Senior Term Facility, which has been accounted for as a debt modification, as the new loan is
 not considered substantially different from the existing loan. There was no debt extinguishment during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 .

Interest Expense

For the three months ended September 30, 2024 , interest expense was 537 as compared to 528 for the
 three months ended September 30, 2023 . The increase was primarily the result of a higher effective interest rate on our variable rate Senior Term Facility.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , interest expense was 1,592 as compared to 1,112 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 . The increase was primarily the result of a higher effective interest rate on our
 variable rate Senior Term Facility and the additional 7,000 borrowed under our Senior Term Facility on June 30, 2023.

Other Income

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 we received 864 from the Employee Retention Credit, a
 refundable tax credit available under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Securities Act CARES Act that was designed to keep employees on the payroll during the COVID-19 pandemic. There was no such credit received during the three months ended September 30, 2024 or the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 .

Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA

We have determined to supplement our condensed consolidated financial statements, prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America U.S. GAAP ), presented
 elsewhere within this Report, with certain non-GAAP measures of financial performance. These non-GAAP measures include non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA, Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization. 

This non-GAAP disclosure has limitations as an analytical tool, should not be viewed as a substitute for Net Earnings (Loss) determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and should not be considered in isolation or as a
 substitute for analysis of the Company s results as reported under U.S. GAAP, nor is it necessarily comparable to non-GAAP performance measures that may be presented by other companies. We consider these non-GAAP measures in addition to our results
 prepared under current accounting standards, but they are not a substitute for, nor superior to, U.S. GAAP measures. These non-GAAP measures are provided to enhance readers overall understanding of our current financial performance and to provide
 further information for comparative purposes. This supplemental presentation should not be construed as an inference that the Company s future results will be unaffected by similar adjustments to Net Earnings (Loss) determined in accordance with
 U.S. GAAP. Specifically, we believe the non-GAAP measures provide useful information to management and investors by isolating certain expenses, gains and losses that may not be indicative of our core operating results and business outlook. In
 addition, we believe non-GAAP measures enhance the comparability of results against prior periods.

Reconciliation to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure of all non-GAAP measures included in this Report is as follows:

Liquidity and Capital Resources

As of September 30, 2024 , we had working capital of 1,834 compared to working capital of 3,369 as of
 December 31, 2023 . The change in working capital was primarily the result of an increase in cash and cash equivalents from proceeds received
 upon the issuance of common stock, offset by an increase in accrued expenses and other current liabilities and deferred revenues. Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash were 8,396 as of September 30, 2024 , as compared to 8,118 as of December 31, 2023 .

In September 2021, we entered into the Senior Term Facility with MidCap, also acting as the administrative agent, and the lenders identified therein and borrowed 8,000 in the form of a senior term loan. The term
 loan bore interest at LIBOR (with a LIBOR floor rate of 0.50 plus 7.50 per year. In September 2022, we amended the facility to transition, upon the cessation of LIBOR, to bear interest at one-month Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR ), or
 such other applicable period, plus 0.10 , with a floor of 0.50 . In June 2023, we amended the credit facility to: (i) refinance our existing 8,000 term loan, (ii) borrow an additional 7,000, and (iii) provide for an additional 5,000 tranche that
 can be drawn under certain conditions in 2024. The facility matures on June 1, 2028. Borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the sum of (a) the greater of (i) the sum of (A) 30-day forward-looking term rate
 of one month SOFR, as published by CME Group Benchmark Administration Limited, from time to time, plus (B) 0.10 , and (ii) the applicable floor rate of 3.50 , with such sum reset monthly, and (b) 7.50 . We are obligated to make interest-only
 payments through June 2026. From July 2026 to maturity, we will make principal payments in 24 equal installments. We also amended and restated the existing warrant to allow MidCap to purchase 80,000 shares of our common stock at an exercise price
 of 8.80 per share for a 10-year period ending June 30, 2033. The loan is senior to all other indebtedness and is secured by substantially all of our assets. We are subject to customary affirmative and negative covenants, including a financial
 covenant based on minimum net revenue thresholds. Upon an event of default, including a covenant violation, all principal and interest are due on demand.

In February 2024, the parties amended the credit and security agreement in order to, among other things, revise the applicable minimum net revenue threshold financial covenant. For the trailing 12-month periods
 ending March 31, 2024, June 30, 2024, September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2024, these amounts are set at 29,000, 29,250, 29,500 and 30,000, respectively, and increasing to 33,000 as set forth in such amendment for the trailing 12-month periods
 thereafter.

In January 2022, we acquired certain assets related to the TheraClear devices from Theravant. Theravant is eligible to receive up to 3,000 in future earnout payments upon the achievement of certain annual net
 revenue milestones 1,000 of which is due upon the earlier of achieving a revenue target or July 2025), up to 20,000 in future royalty payments based upon a percentage of gross profit from future domestic sales ranging from 10-20 , 25 of gross
 profit from international sales over the subsequent four-year period, and up to 500 in future milestone payments upon the achievement of certain development and commercialization related targets. Through September
 30, 2024 , we have incurred an aggregate of 122 of royalty and gross profit payments based on gross profit from domestic and international sales.

In October 2021, we entered into an equity distribution agreement with an investment bank under which we may sell up to 11,000 of our shares of common stock in registered at-the-market offerings. The shares will
 be offered at prevailing market prices, and we will pay commissions of up to 3.00 of the gross proceeds from the sale of shares sold through our agent, which may act as an agent and/or principal. We have no obligation to sell any shares under this
 agreement and may, at any time, suspend solicitations under this agreement. In July 2024, we sold 665,136 shares of our common stock for gross proceeds of approximately 2,100. As of September 30, 2024 , we may
 sell up to an additional 8,900 shares of our common stock under this distribution agreement.

We cannot predict our revenues and expenses in the short term as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war, the Middle East conflict, supply chain disruptions, rising interest rates, and
 related responses by our customers and our ultimate consumers as a result thereof. Based on our current business plan, we believe that our cash and cash equivalents, combined with the anticipated revenues from the sale or use of our products and
 operating expense management, will be sufficient to satisfy our working capital needs, capital asset purchases, outstanding commitments and other liquidity requirements associated with our existing operations for at least the next 12 months
 following the date of the issuance of these interim condensed consolidated financial statements. However, if these sources are insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements, we may seek to sell additional debt or equity securities or enter
 into a new credit facility or another form of third-party funding or seek other debt financing. If we raise additional funds by issuing equity or equity-linked securities, our stockholders would experience dilution and any new equity securities
 could have rights, preferences, and privileges superior to those of holders of our common stock. Debt financing, if available, may involve covenants restricting our operations or our ability to incur additional debt. We cannot be assured that
 additional equity, equity-linked or debt financing will be available on terms favorable to us or our stockholders, or at all. It is also possible that we may allocate significant amounts of capital towards products or technologies for which market
 demand is lower than expected and, as a result, abandon such efforts. If we are unable to maintain our current financing or obtain adequate additional financing when we require it, or if we obtain financing on terms which are not favorable to us,
 or if we expend capital on products or technologies that are unsuccessful, our ability to continue to support our business growth and to respond to business challenges could be significantly limited, or we may be required to delay the development,
 commercialization and marketing of our products.

Net cash used in operating activities was 515 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , compared
 to net cash used in operating activities of 1,890 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 . The decrease in cash used in operating
 activities is primarily the result of a decrease in the net loss, offset by a decrease in non-cash expenses, including a decrease in (i) loss on debt extinguishment as the extinguishment of the Senior Term Facility occurred in 2023, (ii)
 stock-based compensation expense as a result of fewer grants of awards and more forfeitures in 2024, and (iii) amortization expense related to the write-down of the technology intangible asset for the TheraClear devices in the fourth quarter of
 2023 in connection with the revaluation of the contingent consideration related to the TheraClear asset acquisition.

Net cash used in investing activities was 1,132 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , compared
 to net cash used in investing activities of 3,301 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 . The decrease is primarily the result
 of a greater emphasis on refurbishing units that have been recalled from underperforming accounts as part of our stated plan to realign devices, which has a lower cost than building new units.

Net cash provided by financing activities was 1,925 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , compared to net cash provided by financing activities of 6,861 for the nine months ended September 30,
 2023 . The financing activity for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 consisted of 1,943 in net proceeds from the
 issuance of common stock, partially offset by an 18 payment of contingent consideration to Theravant, whereas the cash provided by financing activities in 2023 was primarily due to the refinancing of the
 Senior Term Facility, pursuant to which we borrowed an additional 6,903 , net of financing costs.

Controls and Procedures

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as such term
 is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act )), as of September 30, 2024 . Based on that evaluation, management has concluded that, as of such date,
 our disclosure controls and procedures were effective.

Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls

A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Because of inherent limitations in all control
 systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues, if any, within an organization have been detected. Accordingly, our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable, not absolute,
 assurance that the objectives of our disclosure control system are met and, as set forth above, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded, based on their evaluation as of the end of the period covered by this Report,
 that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that the objectives of our disclosure control system were met.

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting in our most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over
 financial reporting.

PART II - Other Information

ITEM 1.

Legal Proceedings

From time to time in the ordinary course of our business, we may be a party to certain legal proceedings, incidental to the normal course of our business. These may include controversies relating to contract claims
 and employment related matters, some of which claims may be material, in which case, we will make separate disclosure as required.

In the ordinary course of business, we are, from time to time, subject to audits
 performed by state taxing authorities. These actions and proceedings are generally based on the position that the arrangements entered into by us are subject to sales and use tax rather than exempt from tax under applicable law. The states of
 New York and California have assessed us an aggregate of 5.2 million including penalties and interest. The audits cover the period from March 2014 through November 2022. We received notification that an administrative state judge in
 New York issued an opinion finding in favor of us that the sale of XTRAC treatment codes was not taxable as sales tax with respect to that state s first assessment. This ruling covers 1.8 million of the total 5.2 million of assessments. The
 relevant taxing authority filed an appeal of the administrative law judge s finding and, following the submission of legal briefs by both sides and oral argument held in January 2022, on May 6, 2022, we received a written decision from the State
 of New York Appeals Tribunal Tribunal overturning the favorable sales tax determination of the administrative law judge. We appealed the Tribunal s decision to the New York State Appellate Division Appellate Division ), and posted the
 required appellate bond in the form of cash collateral. Oral argument was held by the Appellate Division on January 18, 2024.

On March 8, 2024, we received a decision from the Appellate Division ruling against us in the matter of our sales tax appeal, affirming the Tribunal's ruling that
 our sale of XTRAC treatment codes is subject to sales tax. The Appellate Division concluded that, through the usage arrangements, our customers had possession of the laser devices and had a license and ability to use the laser devices. The
 Appellate Division also agreed with the Tribunal that the primary function analysis was not applicable in this matter. On April 11, 2024, we filed a motion for leave to appeal the Appellate Division s decision to the New York State Court of
 Appeals Court of Appeals ). On October 22, 2024, in an unsigned one-line decision, the Court of Appeals denied our motion to appeal the Appellate Division ruling.
 Therefore, the adverse decision stands and New York will execute on the appellate bond we posted for 1.3 million. As of September 30, 2024, we have accrued 1.8 million including penalties and interest as a result of the Appellate Division
 ruling. We are in the administrative process of appeal with respect to the remaining 1.3 million of assessments in the State of New York. We believe that the Appellate Division ruling provides an avenue for challenging the pending audit
 periods and subsequent periods, provided we can show that the value of the equipment provided to customers is incidental to the overall value of the non-taxable services that are provided.

The State of California has made aggregate assessments of 2.1 million including penalties and interest. The audits cover the period from June 2018 through June 2022. We are in the administrative process of appeal in
 this jurisdiction as well.

If there is a determination that the true object of our recurring revenue model is not exempt fro m sales taxes and is not a prescription medicine, or we do not have other defenses where
 we prevail, we may be subject to sales taxes in those particular states for previous years and in the future, plus potential interest and penalties.
