The inputs used in the fair value measurement were non-observable and, as such, were categorized as a Level 3 valuation. ProAssurance did have any other assets or liabilities that were measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis at September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023. 
 Financial Instruments - Methodologies Other Than Fair Value 
 Other investments Other assets Financial liabilities: Revolving Credit Agreement Term Loan 
 Contribution Certificates Other liabilities Carrying value excludes unamortized debt issuance costs.

 Qualified affordable housing project tax credit partnership interests held by ProAssurance generate investment returns by providing tax benefits to fund investors in the form of tax credits and project operating losses. The carrying value of these investments reflects ProAssurance's total commitments (both funded and unfunded) to the partnerships, less any amortization. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, ProAssurance did not have an ownership percentage greater than in any tax credit partnership interests. Since ProAssurance has the ability to exert influence over the partnerships but does not control them, all are accounted for using the equity method. See further discussion of the entities in which ProAssurance holds passive interests in Note 11.

 Equity in Earnings (Loss) of Unconsolidated Subsidiaries 
 Equity in earnings (loss) of unconsolidated subsidiaries included losses from tax credit partnerships. Investment results recorded reflect ProAssurance's allocable portion of partnership operating results. Tax credits reduce income tax expense in the period they are utilized. 
 Tax credits recognized 
 ProAssurance accounts for its tax credit partnership investments under the equity method of accounting and records its allocable portion of the operating losses of the underlying properties based on estimates provided by the partnerships. For the Company's qualified affordable housing project tax credit partnerships, it adjusts its estimates of their allocable portion of operating losses periodically as actual operating results of the underlying properties become available. The primary benefits of tax credits and tax-deductible operating losses from the historic tax credit partnerships are earned in a short period with potential for additional cash flows extending over several years. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company generated a nominal amount of tax credits from its tax credit partnership investments as compared to million and million for the same respective periods of 2023, which were deferred and are expected to be utilized in future periods. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had approximately million of available tax credit carryforwards generated from its investments in tax credit partnerships which they expect to utilize in future periods.

As a result, the reserve estimate may vary considerably from the eventual outcome. The assumptions used in establishing ProAssurance s reserve are regularly reviewed and updated by management as new data becomes available. Changes to estimates of previously established reserves are included in earnings in the period in which the estimate is changed.

 Estimating liability reserves is complex and requires the use of many assumptions. As time passes and ultimate losses for prior years are either known or become subject to a more precise estimation, ProAssurance increases or decreases the reserve estimates established in prior periods. 
 The consolidated net favorable prior year reserve development recognized for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily reflected: 
 Net favorable prior year reserve development recognized in the Specialty P C segment of million driven by million of net favorable development in the Company's MPL line of business, principally related to accident years 2018 and prior in the segment's legacy book and the 2021 accident year for the segment's NORCAL book. Further, net favorable reserve development reflected million of favorable development related to the Company's Medical Technology Liability line of business, partially offset by unfavorable reserve development of million attributable to the Company's Lloyd s Syndicates operations. 
 Consolidated net favorable loss development recognized during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 also included net favorable development of million in the Segregated Portfolio Reinsurance segment related to workers' compensation business of million, principally related to accident years 2020 through 2022, partially offset by unfavorable development of million related to medical professional liability business due to higher than expected claim frequency in one program in which the Company does not participate in the underwriting results. 
 For additional information regarding ProAssurance's prior year reserve development recognized for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and the year ended December 31, 2023, see Note 6 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in ProAssurance's September 30, 2023 report on Form 10-Q and Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in ProAssurance's December 31, 2023 report on Form 10-K, respectively.

 million at September 30, 2024 (see Note 3). During the second quarter of 2024, the Company received a return of approximately million of cash from its FAL balances due to lower capital requirements for the 2023 underwriting year. 
 ProAssurance has entered into financial instrument transactions that may present off-balance sheet credit risk or market risk. These transactions include a short-term loan commitment and commitments to provide funding to non-public investment entities. Under the short-term loan commitment, ProAssurance has agreed to advance funds on a day basis to a counterparty provided there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. As of September 30, 2024, ProAssurance had total funding commitments related to non-public investment entities as well as the short-term loan commitment of approximately million which included the amount at risk if the full short-term loan is extended and the counterparties default. However, the credit risk associated with the short-term loan commitment is minimal as the counterparties to the contract are highly rated commercial institutions and to-date have been performing in accordance with their contractual obligations. As such, ProAssurance s expected credit losses associated with this short-term loan commitment were nominal in amount as of September 30, 2024. 
 The purchase consideration in the NORCAL acquisition included contingent consideration. NORCAL policyholders who elected to receive NORCAL stock and tender it to ProAssurance are eligible for a share of contingent consideration in an amount of up to approximately million. As defined in the purchase agreement, the contingent consideration is dependent upon the after-tax development of NORCAL's ultimate net losses for accident years ended on or before December 31, 2020 determined as of December 31, 2023 by a mutually agreed upon independent actuarial consultant. In June 2024, the independent actuarial consulting firm completed its estimate, and based on that estimate no additional consideration is due. The Committee appointed by NORCAL prior to the close of the acquisition reviewed the work of the independent actuarial consultant and accepted the conclusion that no additional consideration is due; therefore, the liability was reduced to zero as of June 30, 2024. As of December 31, 2023, the contingent consideration liability was million carried at fair value utilizing a stochastic model. As of December 31, 2023, the remaining uncertainty around the analysis to be performed by the independent actuary was a significant component in the determination of the fair value of the liability. See further discussion around the contingent consideration in Note 2.

 forward-starting interest rate swap agreements ("Interest Rate Swaps") on May 2, 2023, each with an effective date of December 29, 2023 and a maturity date of March 31, 2028. As ProAssurance's Interest Rate Swaps are designated and qualify as highly effective cash flow hedges, changes in the fair value of the Interest Rate Swaps are recorded in AOCI, net of tax, and are reclassified into earnings when the hedged cash flows impact earnings. The Interest Rate Swap hedging the variability in cash flows associated with interest payments on the Revolving Credit Agreement will have a constant million notional amount throughout the term of the swap, while the Interest Rate Swap hedging the variability in cash flows associated with interest payments on the Term Loan will have an amortizing million notional amount, which is designed to match the outstanding principal on the Term Loan throughout the term of the swap. Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Agreement and Term Loan will accrue interest at a selected base rate, adjusted by a margin. The Interest Rate Swaps effectively fix the base rate on borrowings under the Revolving Credit Agreement and Term Loan to and , respectively. The margin component of the interest rate, which can vary from to , will remain variable and is based on ProAssurance s debt to capitalization ratio. As of September 30, 2024, the margin component of the interest rate on the outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Agreement and Term Loan was and , respectively, based on ProAssurance's debt to capitalization ratio as of June 30, 2024 resulting in a total interest rate of and , respectively, including the effect of the Interest Rate Swaps on the base rate.

ProAssurance does not have power over the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of these VIEs and thus is not the primary beneficiary. Investments in entities where ProAssurance holds a greater than minor interest but does not hold a controlling interest are accounted for using the equity method. Therefore, ProAssurance has not consolidated these VIEs. ProAssurance s involvement with each of these VIEs is limited to its direct ownership interest in the VIE. Except for the funding commitments disclosed in Note 7, ProAssurance has no arrangements with any of these VIEs to provide other financial support to or on behalf of the VIE. At September 30, 2024, ProAssurance s maximum loss exposure relative to these investments was limited to the carrying value of ProAssurance s investment in the VIE. 
 ProAssurance is the primary beneficiary of PPM RRG. While there is no direct ownership of PPM RRG by ProAssurance, it manages the business operations of PPM RRG through its management services agreement and has effective control of the PPM RRG's Board of Directors through an irrevocable voting proxy. The management services agreement allows ProAssurance to provide management and oversight services to PPM RRG, which includes the ability to make business decisions impacting the operations of PPM RRG. PPM RRG has a million surplus note to NORCAL which is its only source of capital.

 segments that are organized around the nature of the products and services provided: Specialty P C, Workers' Compensation Insurance, Segregated Portfolio Cell Reinsurance and Corporate. Additional information regarding ProAssurance's segments is included in Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in ProAssurance s December 31, 2023 report on Form 10-K. A description of each of ProAssurance's operating and reportable segments follows. 
 Specialty P C primarily includes medical professional liability insurance and medical technology liability insurance. The Specialty P C segment also includes the underwriting results from ProAssurance's participation in Lloyd's of London Syndicate 1729 and Syndicate 6131. 
 Workers' Compensation Insurance includes workers' compensation insurance products which are provided primarily to employers with or fewer employees. 
 Segregated Portfolio Cell Reinsurance includes the results (underwriting profit or loss, plus investment results, net of U.S. federal income taxes) of SPCs at Inova Re and Eastern Re, the Company's Cayman Islands SPC operations. 
 Corporate includes ProAssurance's investment operations excluding those reported in the Company's Segregated Portfolio Cell Reinsurance segment. In addition, this segment includes corporate expenses, interest expense, U.S. and U.K. income taxes and non-premium revenues generated outside of the Company's insurance entities. 
 The accounting policies of the segments are described in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in ProAssurance s December 31, 2023 report on Form 10-K. ProAssurance evaluates the performance of its Specialty P C and Workers' Compensation Insurance segments based on before tax underwriting profit or loss. ProAssurance evaluates the performance of its Segregated Portfolio Cell Reinsurance segment based on operating profit or loss, which includes investment results of investment assets solely allocated to SPC operations, net of U.S. federal income taxes. Performance of the Corporate segment is evaluated based on the contribution made to consolidated after-tax results. ProAssurance accounts for inter-segment transactions as if the transactions were to third parties at current market prices. Assets are not allocated to segments because investments, other than the investments discussed above that are solely allocated to the Segregated Portfolio Cell Reinsurance segment, and other assets are not managed at the segment level. The tabular information that follows shows the financial results of the Company's reportable segments reconciled to results reflected in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income. ProAssurance does not consider goodwill or intangible asset impairments, changes in the fair value of contingent consideration or transaction-related costs for completed business combinations, including any related tax impacts, in assessing the financial performance of its operating and reportable segments, and thus are included in the reconciliation of segment results to consolidated results.

 ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 
 The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes to those statements which accompany this report. Throughout the discussion we use certain terms and abbreviations, which can be found in the Glossary of Terms and Acronyms at the beginning of this report. In addition, a glossary of insurance terms and phrases is available on the investor section of our website. Throughout the discussion, references to "ProAssurance," "ProAssurance Group," "PRA," "Company," "we," "us" and "our" refer to ProAssurance Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries. The discussion contains certain forward-looking information that involves significant risks, assumptions and uncertainties. As discussed under the heading "Caution Regarding Forward-Looking Statements," our actual financial condition and results of operations could differ significantly from these forward-looking statements. 
 
 ProAssurance Overview 
 ProAssurance Corporation is a holding company for property and casualty insurance companies. Our insurance subsidiaries provide medical professional liability insurance, liability insurance for medical technology and life sciences risks and workers' compensation insurance. 
 We operate in four segments which are based on our internal management reporting structure for which financial results are regularly evaluated by our CODM to determine resource allocation and assess operating performance: Specialty P C, Workers' Compensation Insurance, Segregated Portfolio Cell Reinsurance and Corporate. Additional information on ProAssurance's four operating and reportable segments is included in Note 13 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in our December 31, 2023 report on Form 10-K and in the Segment Results sections herein that follow. 
 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 Our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in conformity with GAAP. Preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts we report on those statements. We evaluate these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis based on current and historical developments, market conditions, industry trends and other information that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. We can make no assurance that actual results will conform to our estimates and assumptions; reported results of operations may be materially affected by changes in these estimates and assumptions. A detailed discussion of our critical accounting estimates is included in our Critical Accounting Estimates section in Item 7 of our December 31, 2023 report on Form 10-K. 
 Management considers the following accounting estimates to be critical because they involve significant judgment by management and those judgments could result in a material effect on our financial statements: 
 Reserve for losses and loss adjustment expenses 
 Reinsurance 
 Valuation of investments and impairment of securities 
 Income taxes 
 
 Estimation of Taxes 
 For interim periods, we generally utilize the estimated annual effective tax rate method under which we determine our provision (benefit) for income taxes based on the current estimate of our annual effective tax rate. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we utilized the estimated annual effective tax rate method. Under this method, items which are unusual, infrequent, or that cannot be reliably estimated are considered in the effective tax rate in the period in which the item is included in income and are referred to as discrete items. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we utilized the discrete effective tax rate method for recording income taxes after the estimated annual effective tax rate method produced an unreliable estimated annual effective tax rate. See further discussion on these methods in Note 4 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources and Financial Condition 
 
 Overview 
 ProAssurance Corporation is a holding company and is a legal entity separate and distinct from its subsidiaries. As a holding company, our principal source of external revenue is our investment revenues. In addition, dividends from our operating subsidiaries represent another source of funds for our obligations, including debt service and shareholder dividends, if declared. We also charge our core domestic operating subsidiaries within our Specialty P C and Workers' Compensation Insurance segments a management fee based on the extent to which services are provided to the subsidiary and the amount of gross premium written by the subsidiary. At September 30, 2024, we held cash and liquid investments of approximately 78 million outside our insurance subsidiaries that were available for use without regulatory approval or other restriction. As of November 4, 2024, we also have an additional 125 million in permitted borrowings available under our Revolving Credit Agreement as well as the possibility of a 50 million accordion feature, if successfully subscribed, as discussed in this section under the heading "Debt." 
 To date during 2024, our operating subsidiaries have paid dividends to us of approximately 66 million, of which 20 million was paid in October 2024. Dividends paid in October 2024 have not been included in our cash and liquid investments held outside of insurance subsidiaries as of September 30, 2024. Excluding the dividends paid in October 2024, our insurance subsidiaries, in the aggregate, are permitted to pay dividends of approximately 99 million over the remainder of 2024 without prior approval of state insurance regulators. However, the payment of any dividend requires prior notice to the insurance regulator in the state of domicile, and the regulator may reduce or prevent the dividend if, in its judgment, payment of the dividend would have an adverse effect on the surplus of the insurance subsidiary. We make the decision to pay dividends from an insurance subsidiary based on the capital needs of that subsidiary and may pay less than the permitted dividend or may also request permission to pay an additional amount (an extraordinary dividend). 
 
 Cash Flows 
 Cash flows between periods compare as follows: 
 Nine Months Ended September 30 (In thousands) 2024 2023 Change Net cash provided (used) by: Operating activities (10,477) (46,641) 36,164 Investing activities (5,724) 137,335 (143,059) Financing activities (4,399) (58,543) 54,144 Increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents (20,600) 32,151 (52,751) 
 The principal components of our operating cash flows are the excess of premiums collected and net investment income over losses paid and operating costs, including income taxes. Timing delays exist between the collection of premiums and the payment of losses associated with the premiums. Premiums are generally collected within the twelve-month period after the policy is written, while our claim payments are generally paid over a more extended period of time. Likewise, timing delays exist between the payment of claims and the collection of any associated reinsurance recoveries. 
 The increase in operating cash flows of 36.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to: 
 A decrease in paid losses of 51.2 million driven by our Specialty P C segment driven by a lower number of claims resolved with large indemnity payments as compared to the prior year period. Claim costs in our MPL line of business continue to be pressured by social inflation and higher than anticipated loss severity trends. 
 An increase in cash received from investment income of 6.8 million driven by higher average book yields as we take advantage of current rate environment as our portfolio matures. 
 An increase in net premium receipts of 3.3 million primarily driven by a decrease in cash paid to reinsurers primarily associated with the non-renewal of an alternative market program in our Segregated Portfolio Cell Reinsurance segment effective January 1, 2024 and, to a lesser extent, a shared risk arrangement, partially offset by the proactive actions we have taken in certain lines to improve profitability. 
 The increase in operating cash flows was partially offset by: 
 An increase in cash paid for operating expenses of 13.4 million driven by the receipt of cash collateral during the prior year period to secure the net present value of future cash flows associated with the Interest Rate Swaps of 10.7 million, partially offset by a decrease in compensation-related costs primarily as a result of a decrease in paid bonuses.

 The effect of a tax refund of approximately 11.7 million which we received in February 2023 (see additional discussion within this section under the heading "Taxes" that follows). 
 The remaining variance in operating cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period of 2023 was composed of individually insignificant components. 
 We manage our investing cash flows to ensure that we will have sufficient liquidity to meet our obligations, taking into consideration the timing of cash flows from our investments, including interest payments, dividends and principal payments, as well as the expected cash flows to be generated by our operations as discussed in this section under the heading "Investing Activities and Related Cash Flows." 
 Our financing cash flows are primarily comprised of share repurchases and dividend payments in the prior year period (see additional discussion on the Board's decision to suspend payment of a quarterly cash dividend of in Note 10 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements). 
 
 Operating Activities and Related Cash Flows 
 
 Reinsurance 
 Within our Specialty P C segment, we use insurance and reinsurance (collectively, reinsurance to provide capacity to write larger limits of liability, to provide reimbursement for losses incurred under the higher limit coverages we offer and to provide protection against losses in excess of policy limits. Within our Workers' Compensation Insurance segment, we use reinsurance to reduce our net liability on individual risks, to mitigate the effect of significant loss occurrences (including catastrophic events), to stabilize underwriting results and to increase underwriting capacity by decreasing leverage. In both our Specialty P C and Workers' Compensation Insurance segments, we use reinsurance in risk sharing arrangements to align our objectives with those of our strategic business partners and to provide custom insurance solutions for large customer groups. The discussion in our Liquidity section under the same heading in Item 7 of our December 31, 2023 report on Form 10-K includes additional information regarding our reinsurance agreements. 
 Our Medical Professional Liability and Medical Technology Liability treaties renew annually on October 1 and our Workers' Compensation treaty renews annually on May 1. Our MPL and Medical Technology Liability treaties renewed October 1, 2024. Our MPL treaty renewal incorporated podiatric and chiropractic policies and MPL coverages in excess of 2 million changed from 9 to 0 co-participation. The next 24 million of risk changed from 9.5 to 7.5 co-participation. Our Medical Technology Liability treaty renewed at a higher rate than the previous treaty. All other material terms were consistent with the expiring treaties. Our traditional workers' compensation treaty renewed May 1, 2024 at a higher contract rate than the previous treaty and included the elimination of the AAD as well as an increase in the per occurrence retention to 0.75 million from 0.5 million. Overall, the impact of our traditional workers' compensation treaty renewal is expected to increase our ceded premium ratio while losses related to the increase in the per occurrence retention are expected to be more than offset by the elimination of the AAD. The significant coverages provided by our current excess of loss reinsurance agreements are depicted in the following table.

 Taxes 
 We are subject to the tax laws and regulations of the U.S., Cayman Islands and U.K. We file a consolidated U.S. federal income tax return that includes the parent company and its U.S. subsidiaries, except for ProAssurance American Mutual, A Risk Retention Group. Our filing obligations include a requirement to make quarterly payments of estimated taxes to the IRS using the corporate tax rate effective for the tax year. We did not make any quarterly estimated tax payments during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 or 2023 as we expect NOL carryforwards to offset any income taxes due. 
 As a result of the CARES Act that was signed into law on March 27, 2020, we were permitted to carryback NOLs generated in tax years 2019 and 2020 for up to five years. We generated an NOL of approximately 33.3 million from the 2020 tax year that was carried back to the 2015 tax year that resulted in a tax refund of approximately 11.7 million which was received in February 2023. In addition, the CARES Act included the initial version of the ERC which was extended and expanded in December 2020 and March 2021. See further discussion of the ERC in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in our December 31, 2023 report on Form 10-K. As an eligible employer under the provisions of the CARES Act, NORCAL filed a claim for a payroll tax refund of approximately 3.8 million during the second quarter of 2023, based on eligible wages paid during 2020. 
 As a result of the NORCAL acquisition, we have U.S. federal NOL carryforwards, which were approximately 24.0 million as of September 30, 2024. These NOL carryforwards are subject to limitation by Internal Revenue Code Section 382 and will begin to expire in 2041.

 A detailed listing of our investment holdings as of September 30, 2024 is located under the Financial Information heading on the Investor Relations page of our website which can be reached directly at https://investor.proassurance.com/financial-information/quarterly-investment-supplements/default.aspx or through links from the Investor Relations section of our website, https://investor.proassurance.com/corporate-profile/default.aspx. 
 We manage our investments to ensure that we will have sufficient liquidity to meet our obligations, taking into consideration the timing of cash flows from our investments, including interest payments, dividends and principal payments, as well as the expected cash flows to be generated or used by our operations. In addition to the interest and dividends we will receive from our investments, we anticipate that between 100 million and 150 million of our portfolio will mature (or be paid down) each quarter over the next twelve months and become available, if needed, to meet our cash flow requirements. Our reinvestment rate of cash flows compared to recent years is more intermittent due to anticipated higher severity and paid loss trends in our MPL line of business and our Workers' Compensation Insurance segment. From time to time our cash balances will fluctuate depending on the actual timing of paid losses. The primary outflow of cash at our insurance subsidiaries is related to paid losses and operating costs, including income taxes. The payment of individual claims cannot be predicted with certainty; therefore, we rely upon the history of paid claims in estimating the timing of future claims payments with consideration given to current and anticipated industry trends and macroeconomic conditions. To the extent that we may have an unanticipated shortfall in cash, we may either liquidate securities or borrow funds under existing borrowing arrangements through our Revolving Credit Agreement and the FHLB system. As of November 4, 2024, 175 million could be made available for use through our Revolving Credit Agreement, as discussed in this section under the heading "Debt." Given the duration of our investments, we do not foresee a shortfall that would require us to meet operating cash needs through additional borrowings. Additional information regarding our Revolving Credit Agreement is detailed in Note 8 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 At September 30, 2024, our FAL was comprised of cash and cash equivalents and investment securities, primarily available-for-sale fixed maturities, deposited with Lloyd's which had a fair value of 15.5 million. During the second quarter of 2024, we received a return of approximately 5.2 million of cash from our FAL balances due to lower capital requirements for the 2023 underwriting year. Additional information regarding our FAL is detailed in Note 3 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 Our investment portfolio continues to be primarily composed of high quality fixed income securities with approximately 93 of our fixed maturities being investment grade securities as determined by national rating agencies. The weighted average effective duration of our fixed maturity securities at September 30, 2024 was 3.24 years; the weighted average effective duration of our fixed maturity securities combined with our short-term securities was 3.05 years. 
 The carrying value and unfunded commitments for certain of our investments were as follows: 
 Carrying Value September 30, 2024 in thousands, except expected funding period) September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Unfunded Commitment Expected funding period in years Qualified affordable housing project tax credit partnerships (1) 
 298 666 81 3 All other investments, primarily investment fund LPs/LLCs 271,192 276,090 126,512 4 Total 271,490 276,756 126,593 (1) The carrying value reflects our total commitments (both funded and unfunded) to the partnerships, less any amortization, since our initial investment. We fund these investments based on funding schedules maintained by the partnerships. 
 
 Investment fund LPs/LLCs are by nature less liquid and may involve more risk than other investments. We manage our risk through diversification of asset class and geographic location. At September 30, 2024, we had investments in 33 separate investment funds with a total carrying value of 271.2 million which represented approximately 6 of our total investments. Our investment fund LPs/LLCs generate earnings from trading portfolios, secured debt, debt securities, multi-strategy funds and private equity investments, and the performance of these LPs/LLCs is affected by the volatility of equity and credit markets. For our investments in LPs/LLCs, we record our allocable portion of the partnership operating income or loss as the results of the LPs/LLCs become available, typically following the end of a reporting period. As of September 30, 2024, our total funding commitments legally outstanding related to our investments in LPs/LLCs were approximately 126.5 million; however, we anticipate capital of approximately 58 million to be drawn based on our current estimates.

 Additional information regarding our debt is provided in Note 8 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in our December 31, 2023 report on Form 10-K. 
 To manage our exposure to interest rate risk due to variability in the base rate on borrowings under the Revolving Credit Agreement and Term Loan, we entered into two forward-starting interest rate swap agreements ("Interest Rate Swaps"). Additional information regarding our Interest Rate Swaps is provided in Note 9 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 Two of our insurance subsidiaries are members of an FHLB. Through membership, those subsidiaries have access to secured cash advances which can be used for liquidity purposes or other operational needs. In order for us to use FHLB proceeds, regulatory approvals may be required depending on the nature of the transaction. To date, those subsidiaries have not materially utilized their membership for borrowing purposes. 
 
 Contingent Consideration 
 Contingent consideration is measured at fair value on the date of acquisition and remeasured at fair value each subsequent reporting period. Fair value of a liability represents the price that would be paid to transfer the liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date considering characteristics specific to the liability. The purchase consideration in the NORCAL acquisition included contingent consideration. NORCAL policyholders who elected to receive NORCAL stock and tender it to ProAssurance are eligible for a share of contingent consideration in an amount of up to approximately 84 million. As defined in the purchase agreement, the contingent consideration is dependent upon the after-tax development of NORCAL's ultimate net losses for accident years ended on or before December 31, 2020 determined as of December 31, 2023 by a mutually agreed upon independent actuarial consultant. 
 In June 2024, the independent actuarial consulting firm completed its estimate, and based on that estimate no additional consideration is due. The Committee appointed by NORCAL prior to the close of the acquisition reviewed the work of the independent actuarial consultant and accepted the conclusion that no additional consideration is due; therefore, the liability was reduced to zero as of June 30, 2024. As of December 31, 2023, the contingent consideration liability was 6.5 million carried at fair value utilizing a stochastic model (see Note 2 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements). As of December 31, 2023, the remaining uncertainty around the analysis to be performed by the independent actuary was a significant component in the determination of the fair value of the liability. See further discussion around the contingent consideration in Note 2 and Note 7 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 Given the contingent consideration associated with the NORCAL acquisition was dependent upon the after-tax development of NORCAL's ultimate net losses between December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2023, we bifurcated changes in the contingent consideration for periods prior to 2024 between fair value changes and, if applicable, changes in estimates of NORCAL's ultimate net losses for accident years 2020 and prior. See further discussion regarding our estimates of ultimate net losses in this section under the heading "Reserve for Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses" in the Critical Accounting Estimates section in Item 7 of our December 31, 2023 report on Form 10-K. Changes in the contingent consideration related to fair value are recognized in earnings as a component of net investment gains (losses) and changes in the contingent consideration related to changes in estimates of NORCAL's ultimate net losses for accident years 2020 and prior are recognized in earnings as component of operating expenses. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the 6.5 million decrease to the contingent consideration liability was recognized as a component of net investment gains (losses). During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded a 1.5 million and 5.5 million decrease to the contingent consideration liability, respectively. The decrease recorded during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 was comprised of 1.5 million and 4.5 million, respectively, related to the remeasurement of the liability to fair value (component of net investment gains (losses)) and 1.0 million related

 Executive Summary of Operations 
 The following sections provide an overview of our consolidated and segment results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. See the Segment Results sections that follow for additional information regarding each segment's results. 
 
 Revenues 
 The following table shows our consolidated and segment net premiums earned: 
 Three Months Ended September 30 Nine Months Ended September 30 in thousands) 2024 2023 Change 2024 2023 Change Net premiums earned Specialty P C 188,704 195,772 (7,068) (3.6 562,137 562,206 (69) Workers' Compensation Insurance 41,829 39,885 1,944 4.9 124,692 121,706 2,986 2.5 Segregated Portfolio Cell Reinsurance 12,627 6,763 5,864 86.7 40,347 46,156 (5,809) (12.6 Consolidated total 243,160 242,420 740 0.3 727,176 730,068 (2,892) (0.4 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, our consolidated net premiums earned increased 0.7 million and decreased 2.9 million, respectively, as compared to the same respective periods of 2023. 
 For our Specialty P C segment, net premiums earned decreased during the 2024 three-month period and remained relatively unchanged during the 2024 nine-month period as compared to the same respective periods of 2023. The decrease for the 2024 three-month period was driven by a decrease in the volume of premium written during the preceding twelve months, primarily due to proactive actions taken in certain lines to improve profitability. 
 For our Workers' Compensation Insurance segment, net premiums earned increased for the 2024 three- and nine-month periods as compared to the same respective periods of 2023 driven by an increase in audit premium billed to policyholders, the renewal of certain policies as traditional business that were previously written in one of the alternative market programs in our Segregated Portfolio Cell Reinsurance segment. Partially offsetting these factors during the 2024 three- and nine-month periods is the continuation of competitive market conditions and, for the 2024 nine-month period, an increase in our carried EBUB estimate of 1.2 million as compared to 2.9 million for the same period of 2023. 
 Net premiums earned in our Segregated Portfolio Cell Reinsurance segment increased for the 2024 three-month period and decreased for the 2024 nine-month period as compared to the same respective periods of 2023. The increase in net premiums earned for the 2024 three-month period was driven by the cancellation of tail coverage, resulting in the reversal of 7.9 million of tail premium previously written and fully earned during the second quarter of 2023. This tail premium related to one program in which we do not participate in the underwriting results and was non-renewed effective January 1, 2024. The decrease in premium for the 2024 nine-month period reflected the non-renewal of a second program; however, as the underlying policies expire in that program, we expect those policies to be renewed as traditional business in our Workers' Compensation Insurance segment. 
 
 The following table shows our consolidated net investment result:

See further discussion around our tax credit partnership investments in the Segment Results - Corporate section under the heading "Net Investment Income" that follows. 
 
 The increase in our consolidated net investment income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same respective periods of 2023 reflected higher average book yields as we take advantage of the current interest rate environment as well as an increase in average investment balances. Our equity in earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries increased for the 2024 three- and nine-month periods as compared to the same respective periods of 2023 driven by

 the performance of certain LPs/LLCs which reflected higher market valuations during the first half of 2024 and, for the 2024 nine-month period, the fourth quarter of 2023. 
 The following table shows our total consolidated net investment gains (losses):

See previous discussion under the heading "Contingent Consideration" in the Financing Activities and Related Cash Flows section. We do not consider these adjustments in assessing the financial performance of any of our segments and therefore, we have excluded them from the Segment Results sections that follow. See Note 13 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for a reconciliation of our segment results to our consolidated results. 
 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized 1.8 million and 3.3 million of credit-related impairment losses in earnings, respectively, primarily related to four corporate bonds in the real estate sector. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recognized a nominal amount and 3.1 million of credit-related impairment losses in earnings, respectively, related to a mortgage-backed security and, for the 2023 nine-month period, two corporate bonds in the financial sector. Additional information regarding investment impairment losses is provided in Note 3 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 We recognized 4.1 million and 1.8 million of other net investment gains for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, primarily driven by unrealized holding gains resulting from changes in the fair value of our equity investments. We recognized 4.1 million of other net investment losses and 1.8 million of other net investment gains for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. Other net investment losses recognized during the three months ended September 30, 2023 were driven by unrealized holding losses resulting from changes in the fair value of our equity investments, partially offset by death benefit proceeds from BOLI contracts. Other net investment gains recognized during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 were driven by unrealized holding gains resulting from changes in the fair value of our convertible securities. 
 
 Consolidated other income (expense) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same respective periods of 2023 was comprised as follows: 
 Three Months Ended September 30 Nine Months Ended September 30 in thousands) 2024 2023 Change 2024 2023 Change Foreign currency exchange rate gains (losses) 
 (3,849) 1,705 (5,554) (325.7 (1,409) 491 (1,900) (387.0 Other 1,651 1,631 20 1.2 5,281 6,373 (1,092) (17.1 Other income (expense) 
 (2,198) 3,336 (5,534) (165.9 3,872 6,864 (2,992) (43.6 
 Excluding foreign currency exchange rate gains (losses), other income remained relatively unchanged for the 2024 three-month period and decreased for the 2024 nine-month period as compared to the same respective periods of 2023. The decrease in the 2024 nine-month period was driven by proceeds of 1.5 million received in the second quarter of 2023 associated with the sale of a portion of our ownership interest in the underwriting and operations entity associated with Syndicate 1729 to an unrelated third party. 
 Foreign currency exchange rate changes are primarily related to foreign currency denominated loss reserves associated with premium assumed from an international medical professional liability insured in our Specialty P C segment. Our participation in this program has grown in recent years which has led to greater volatility in our results of operations even with nominal movements in exchange rates given the size of the reserve. We mitigate foreign exchange exposure by generally matching the currency and duration of associated investments to the corresponding loss reserves as well as utilizing foreign currency forward contracts. When we invest in foreign currency denominated available-for-sale fixed maturities, in accordance with GAAP, the change in market value due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates is reflected as part of OCI. Conversely, the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on loss reserves is reflected through net income (loss) as a component of other income (expense). The effect of exchange rate changes on foreign currency denominated loss reserves are

 reported in our Corporate segment to be consistent with the reporting of the foreign currency denominated invested assets and associated investment income.

 Each segment's contribution to the change in our consolidated current accident year net loss ratios for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same respective periods of 2023 is as follows: 
 Increase (Decrease) 
 2024 versus 2023

 (1.5 pts) (1.3 pts) 
 The improvement in the current accident year net loss ratio for our Specialty P C segment was driven by our continued underwriting and pricing actions which have resulted in a decrease to certain expected loss ratios within our MPL line of business. 
 The current accident year net loss ratio of 77 in our Workers' Compensation Insurance segment for the 2024 three- and nine-month periods improved 4.3 points from the segment's current accident year net loss ratio for the year ended December 31, 2023 of 81.3 . While we continue to observe, and therefore reflect, higher medical loss cost trends, we have seen these trends begin to moderate during the first nine months of 2024. During the 2023 third quarter, we increased the segment's 2023 full-year loss ratio to 76 , from 72.6 , to reflect higher than expected average claim costs which resulted in a current accident year net loss ratio of 83.1 for the 2023 three-month period. 
 The higher current accident year net loss ratio in our Segregated Portfolio Cell Reinsurance segment reflected an increase in claim severity in the current period.

 Our consolidated calendar year net loss ratio can be lower than or higher than our consolidated current accident year net loss ratio due to the recognition of either favorable or unfavorable prior accident year reserve development, respectively. For all periods presented, total net prior accident year reserve development included the favorable impacts of purchase accounting amortization, as shown in the following table.

 Net favorable reserve development recognized in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 is primarily attributable to favorable trends in claim closing patterns in our MPL line of business in our Specialty P C segment. See the Segment Results sections that follow for additional information regarding each segment's current accident year net loss ratio and net prior accident year reserve development.

These transaction-related costs are not included in a segment as we do not consider these costs in assessing the financial performance of any of our operating or reportable segments. We did not incur any transaction-related costs during the three months ended September 30, 2024 or the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. See Note 13 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for a reconciliation of our segment results to our consolidated results. 
 (2) There are no net premiums earned associated with the Corporate segment. Ratios shown are the contribution of the Corporate segment to the consolidated ratio (Corporate operating expenses divided by consolidated net premiums earned). 
 
 The change in our consolidated underwriting expense ratios for the 2024 three- and nine-month periods as compared to the same respective periods of 2023 was primarily attributable to the following: 
 Increase (Decrease) 2024 versus 2023 (In percentage points) Comparative three-month periods Comparative nine-month periods

 Excluding the impact of the items specifically identified in the table above, our consolidated underwriting expense ratios for the 2024 three- and nine-month periods increased by 3.5 and 2.4 percentage points, respectively, as compared to the same respective periods of 2023 driven by higher amounts accrued for performance-related incentive plans across the organization due to the improvement in the related performance metrics.

Table of Contents 

 As shown in the previous table, our consolidated underwriting expense ratios may be impacted by the amount of tail premium written in the period as these premiums are typically fully earned when written with minimal associated expenses. The decrease for the 2024 three-month period primarily reflected the prior year impact of the cancellation and reversal of a medical professional liability tail coverage in our Segregated Portfolio Cell Reinsurance segment, which was previously written and fully earned during the second quarter of 2023. See previous discussion under the heading "Revenues" and further discussion in the Segment Results - Specialty Property and Casualty and Segregated Portfolio Cell Reinsurance sections that follow. 
 
 Taxes 
 Our consolidated provision for income taxes and effective tax rates for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were as follows: 
 in thousands) 
 Nine Months Ended September 30 2024 2023 Change Income (loss) before income taxes 44,345 (48,882) 93,227 190.7 Income tax expense (benefit) 7,770 (3,901) 11,671 299.2 Net income (loss) 36,575 (44,981) 81,556 181.3 Effective tax rate 17.5 8.0 9.5 pts 
 The comparability of our effective tax rates is impacted by the consolidated pre-tax income recognized during the 2024 nine-month period as compared to consolidated pre-tax loss recognized during the 2023 nine-month period. Furthermore, the comparability of our effective tax rates is impacted by our use of the estimated annual effective tax rate method for the 2024 nine-month period versus our use of the discrete effective tax rate method for the 2023 nine-month period. See further discussion on our effective tax rate in the Segment Results - Corporate section that follows under the heading "Taxes." 
 
 Operating Ratio 
 Our operating ratio is our combined ratio, less our investment income ratio. This ratio provides the combined effect of underwriting profitability and investment income. Our operating ratios for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were as follows: 
 Three Months Ended September 30 Nine Months Ended September 30 2024 2023 Change 2024 2023 Change Combined ratio 105.6 116.7 (11.1 pts) 109.4 112.9 (3.5 pts) Less: investment income ratio 15.3 13.5 1.8 pts 14.8 13.0 1.8 pts Operating ratio 
 90.3 103.2 (12.9 pts) 94.6 99.9 (5.3 pts) 
 The primary drivers of the change in our operating ratios were as follows: 
 Increase (Decrease) 
 2024 versus 2023 
 (In percentage points) Comparative three-month periods Comparative nine-month periods Estimated ratio increase (decrease) attributable to: Change in Prior Accident Year Reserve Development (1)

 (12.9 pts) (5.3 pts) (1) Includes the impact of purchase accounting amortization on prior accident year reserve development related to the NORCAL acquisition. 
 
 Excluding the impact of the items specifically identified in the table above, our operating ratios for both the 2024 three- and nine-month periods increased approximately 1.0 percentage point as compared to the same respective periods of 2023 driven by an increase in the consolidated underwriting expense ratio, partially offset by an improvement in the current accident year net loss ratio in our Specialty P C segment and, for the 2024 three-month period, an improvement in the current accident

 year net loss ratio in our Workers' Compensation Insurance segment. See previous discussion in this section under the heading "Expenses" and further discussion in our Segment Results sections that follow. 
 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 Non-GAAP Operating Income (Loss) 
 Non-GAAP operating income (loss) is a financial measure that is widely used to evaluate performance within the insurance sector. In calculating Non-GAAP operating income (loss), we have excluded the effects of the items listed in the following table that do not reflect normal results. We believe Non-GAAP operating income (loss) presents a useful view of the performance of our insurance operations; however, it should be considered in conjunction with net income (loss) computed in accordance with GAAP. 
 The following table is a reconciliation of net income (loss) to Non-GAAP operating income (loss): 
 Three Months Ended September 30 Nine Months Ended September 30 (In thousands, except per share data) 2024 2023 2024 2023 Net income (loss) 16,441 (49,434) 36,575 (44,981) Items excluded in the calculation of Non-GAAP operating income (loss): Net investment (gains) losses (1)

 (1) Net investment gains (losses) recognized in earnings are primarily driven by changes in the value of investments that are marked to fair value each period, the nature and timing of which are unrelated to our normal operating results. Net investment gains (losses) for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 include the 6.5 million decrease to the contingent consideration liability during the second quarter of 2024. Net investment gains (losses) during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 include gains of 1.5 million and 4.5 million, respectively, related to the remeasurement of the contingent consideration liability to fair value. See further discussion around the contingent consideration in Notes 2 and 7 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 (2) Net investment gains (losses) on investments related to SPCs are recognized in our Segregated Portfolio Cell Reinsurance segment. SPC results, including any net investment gain or loss, that are attributable to external cell participants are reflected in the SPC dividend expense (income). To be consistent with our exclusion of net investment gains (losses) recognized in earnings, we are excluding the portion of net investment gains (losses) that is included in the SPC dividend expense (income) which is attributable to the external cell participants. 
 (3) Transaction-related costs are attributable to actuarial consulting fees paid during the second quarter of 2024 in relation to the final determination of contingent consideration associated with the NORCAL acquisition. See previous discussion under the heading "Contingent Consideration" in the Financing Activities and Related Cash Flows section. We are excluding these costs as they do not reflect normal operating results and are unique and non-recurring in nature. 
 (4) Foreign currency exchange rate gains (losses) relate to the impact of foreign exchange rate movements on foreign currency denominated loss reserves predominately associated with premium assumed from an international medical professional liability insured in our Specialty P C segment. Our participation in this program has grown in recent years which has led to greater volatility in our results of operations even with nominal movements in exchange rates given the size of the reserve. We mitigate foreign exchange rate exposure on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet by generally matching the currency and duration of associated investments to the corresponding loss reserves as well as utilizing foreign currency forward contracts. When we invest in foreign currency denominated available-for-sale fixed maturities, in accordance with GAAP, the change in market value due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates is reflected as a part of OCI. Conversely, the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on loss reserves is reflected through net income (loss) as a component of other income (expense). Therefore, we believe foreign currency exchange rate gains (losses) in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income in isolation are not indicative of our operating performance.

 (5) Proceeds associated with the sale of a portion of our ownership interest in the underwriting and operations entity associated with Syndicate 1729 to an unrelated third party recognized in other income in our Corporate segment. We are excluding these costs as they do not reflect normal operating results and are unique and non-recurring in nature. 
 (6) The 21 rate is the annual expected statutory tax rate associated with the taxable or tax deductible items listed above. We utilized the estimated annual effective tax rate method for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, while we used the discrete effective tax rate method for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. See further discussion on these methods in the Critical Accounting Estimates section under the heading "Estimation of Taxes" and in Note 4 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. For the 2024 periods, our effective tax rate was applied to these items in calculating net income (loss), excluding net investment gains (losses) and related adjustments which were treated as discrete items and were tax effected at the annual expected statutory tax rate (21 in the period they were included in our consolidated tax provision and net income (loss). For the 2023 periods, our statutory tax rate was applied to these items in calculating net income (loss), excluding the 2023 goodwill impairment loss which is not tax deductible. Changes in the contingent consideration liability are non-taxable and therefore had no associated income tax impact. The taxes associated with the net investment gains (losses) related to SPCs in our Segregated Portfolio Cell Reinsurance segment are paid by the individual SPCs and are not included in our consolidated tax provision or net income (loss); therefore, both the net investment gains (losses) from our Segregated Portfolio Cell Reinsurance segment and the adjustment to exclude the portion of net investment gains (losses) included in the SPC dividend expense (income) in the table above are not tax effected. 
 Non-GAAP Operating ROE 
 Non-GAAP operating ROE is a financial measure that is calculated as annualized Non-GAAP operating income (loss) for the period divided by the average of beginning and ending total GAAP shareholders equity. As previously discussed, in calculating Non-GAAP operating income (loss), we have excluded the effects of certain items that do not reflect normal results. Non-GAAP operating ROE measures the overall after-tax profitability of our insurance operations and shows how efficiently capital is being used; however, it should be considered in conjunction with ROE computed in accordance with GAAP. The following table is a reconciliation of ROE to Non-GAAP operating ROE for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: 
 Three Months Ended September 30 Nine Months Ended September 30 2024 2023 Change 2024 2023 Change ROE (1)

 Non-GAAP operating ROE for the 2024 three- and nine-month periods increased by 7.8 and 4.4 percentage points, respectively, as compared to the same respective periods of 2023 driven by an improvement in prior accident year reserve development in our Specialty P C and Workers' Compensation Insurance segments, an increase in our net investment result, and, for the 2024 three-month period, an improvement in the current accident year net loss ratio in our Workers' Compensation Insurance segment. See previous discussions in this section under the headings "Executive Summary of Operations" and further discussion in our Segment Results sections that follow. 
 Non-GAAP Adjusted Book Value per Share 
 Book value per share is calculated as total GAAP shareholders equity divided by the total number of common shares outstanding at the balance sheet date. This ratio measures the net worth of the Company to shareholders on a per share basis. 
 Non-GAAP adjusted book value per share is a Non-GAAP measure widely used within the insurance sector and is calculated as shareholders equity, excluding AOCI, divided by the total number of common shares outstanding at the balance sheet date. This Non-GAAP calculation measures the net worth of the Company to shareholders on a per share basis excluding AOCI to eliminate the temporary and potentially significant effects of fluctuations in interest rates on our fixed income portfolio; however, it should be considered in conjunction with book value per share computed in accordance with GAAP. Higher interest rates have led to significant unrealized holding losses on our available-for-sale fixed maturity investments resulting in volatility in AOCI in 2023 and 2024. See Note 10 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

 Book value increased 2.25 per share from December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024 driven by the change in AOCI of 1.56 per share largely due to unrealized holding gains on our fixed income investment portfolio which flow directly to AOCI due to a decrease in interest rates since the end of 2023. Further, the increase in book value per share and Non-GAAP adjusted book value per share reflected net income of 0.71 per share recognized during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

Segment Results - Specialty Property Casualty 
 Our Specialty P C segment primarily focuses on medical professional liability insurance and medical technology liability insurance as discussed in Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in our December 31, 2023 report on Form 10-K. The Specialty P C segment also includes the underwriting results from our participation in Lloyd's of London Syndicate 1729 and Syndicate 6131. Segment results reflected pre-tax underwriting profit or loss from these insurance lines and included the amortization of certain purchase accounting adjustments. Segment results included the following:

 Premiums Written 
 Changes in our premium volume within our Specialty P C segment are generally driven by three primary factors: (1) the amount of new business written, (2) our retention of existing business and (3) the premium charged for business that is renewed, which is affected by rates charged and by the amount and type of coverage an insured chooses to purchase. In addition, premium volume may periodically be affected by shifts in the timing of renewals between periods. 
 The medical professional liability market, which accounts for a majority of the revenues in this segment, remains challenging as physicians continue joining hospitals or larger group practices and, therefore, are no longer purchasing individual or group policies in the standard market. In addition, some competitors have chosen to compete primarily on price. Those carriers have accumulated an excess of capital since approximately 2004 driven largely by drops in claims frequency. They now use that capital to generate higher investment returns supporting operating income over underwriting income. Both factors may impact our ability to write new business and retain existing business. Furthermore, the insurance and reinsurance 
 56 

Table of Contents 

 markets have historically been cyclical, characterized by extended periods of intense price competition and other periods of reduced capacity. The medical professional liability market has historically been particularly affected by these cycles. Underwriting cycles are driven, among other reasons, by excess capacity available to compete for the business. Changes in the frequency and severity of losses may also affect the cycles of the insurance and reinsurance markets significantly. 
 Gross, ceded and net premiums written were as follows:

 Gross Premiums Written 
 During the first quarter of 2024, we moved the podiatric, chiropractic and dental coverages from the Small Business Unit into HCPL, renaming the unit Medical Professional Liability. By combining these resources, we will have a single unit dedicated to all of our healthcare insurance specialty areas and be able to meet customer needs more efficiently and effectively in order to better serve this market. As a result, we reorganized our presentation of gross premiums written by component and related metrics below to better align with the current internal management reporting structure within the segment. All prior period information has been recast to conform to the current period presentation. 
 Gross premiums written by component were as follows: 
 Three Months Ended September 30 Nine Months Ended September 30 in thousands) 2024 2023 Change 2024 2023 Change Medical Professional Liability (1)(2)

 (1) Medical Professional Liability premium was our greatest source of premium revenues in 2024 and 2023. We target the full spectrum of the medical professional liability market, covering multiple categories of healthcare professionals, institutions (which includes hospitals, surgery centers and miscellaneous medical facilities) and, to a lesser extent, facilities specializing in long term residential care. While a majority of our business is written in the standard market, we also offer professional liability insurance on an excess and surplus lines basis through our specialty business. The decrease in MPL premium for the 2024 three- and nine-month periods as compared to the same respective periods of 2023 was driven by retention losses, partially offset by an increase in renewal pricing and, to a lesser extent, new business written. The decrease in MPL premium for the 2024 three-month period was partially offset by the cancellation of tail coverage resulting in the reversal of 7.9 million of tail premium in the prior year period (see additional information in footnote 2 below). Retention losses during the 2024 three- and nine-month periods generally reflect our pursuit of rate adequacy in a competitive market where other carriers may not have the same profitability objectives, appreciate the rate need, or are attempting to gain market share despite near term underwriting losses which can be supported by investment returns from excess capital. Renewal pricing increases during the 2024 three- and nine-month periods reflect our response to the rising loss cost environment and new business written reflects the competitive market conditions. 
 (2) We offer alternative risk and self-insurance products on a customized basis. Our custom alternative risk solutions include a turnkey captive solution whereby we cede either all or a portion of the alternative market premium, net of reinsurance, to two SPCs of our wholly owned Cayman Islands reinsurance subsidiary, Inova Re, which is reported in our Segregated Portfolio Cell Reinsurance segment (see further discussion in the Ceded Premiums Written section that follows). For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, our MPL line of business included 0.7 million and 3.9 million of alternative market gross premium written, respectively, and 6.5 million for the 2023 nine-month period. The 2023 three-month period included the cancellation and reversal of 7.9 million of tail coverage which was previously written and fully earned during the second quarter of 2023. This tail coverage related to one program in which we do not participate in the underwriting results and was non-renewed effective January 1, 2024.

 (3) Our Medical Technology Liability business is marketed throughout the U.S.; coverage is offered on a primary or excess basis, within specified limits, to manufacturers and distributors of medical technology and life sciences products including entities conducting human clinical trials. In addition to the previously listed factors that affect our premium volume, our Medical Technology Liability premium is also impacted by the sales volume of insureds. Our Medical Technology Liability premium remained relatively unchanged for the 2024 three- and nine-month periods as compared to the same respective periods of 2023. Retention losses during the 2024 three- and nine-month periods are primarily attributable to insureds no longer needing coverage or going out of business, an increase in competition on terms and pricing, the broker losing the account, non-payment as well as merger activity within the industry. Changes in renewal pricing during the 2024 three- and nine-month periods are primarily due to changes in the sales volume and changes in exposure of certain insureds. 
 (4) Our Lloyd's Syndicates business includes the results from our participation in Syndicate 1729 at Lloyd's of London. Effective September 2023, we elected to discontinue our participation in the results of Syndicate 1729 beginning with the 2024 underwriting year. For the 2023 underwriting year our participation in the results of Syndicate 1729 was approximately 5 . Our Lloyd s Syndicates premium for the 2024 three- and nine-month periods reflected the impact of our ceased participation. 
 (5) This component of gross premiums written includes all other product lines within our Specialty P C segment, primarily professional liability coverage to attorneys and their firms in select areas of practice. 
 New business written, retention and the change in renewal pricing for our Specialty P C segment and by major component, excluding Lloyd's Syndicates, are shown in the table below:

We may lose insureds to competitors or to alternative insurance mechanisms such as risk retention groups, captive arrangements or self-insurance entities (often when physicians join hospitals or large group practices) or due to pricing or other issues. We may choose not to renew an insured as a result of our underwriting evaluation. Insureds may also terminate coverage because they have left the practice of medicine for various reasons, principally for retirement, death or disability, but also for personal reasons. See further explanation of changes in retention above under the heading "Gross Premiums Written". 
 (2) We are committed to a rate structure that will allow us to fulfill our obligations to our insureds while generating competitive long-term returns for our shareholders. Our pricing continues to be based on expected losses as indicated by our historical loss data and available industry loss data. In recent years, this practice has resulted in rate increases and we anticipate further rate increases due to indications of increasing projected loss severity. Additionally, the pricing of our business includes the effects of filed rates, surcharges and discounts. Renewal pricing reflects changes in our exposure base, deductibles, self-insurance retention limits and other policy terms and conditions. See further explanation of changes in renewal pricing above under the heading "Gross Premiums Written". 
 
 Ceded Premiums Written 
 Ceded premiums represent the amounts owed to our reinsurers for their assumption of a portion of our losses. See previous discussion in our Liquidity and Capital Resources and Financial Condition section under the heading "Reinsurance" for information regarding our Medical Professional Liability and Medical Technology Liability excess of loss reinsurance arrangements. 
 We pay our reinsurers a ceding premium in exchange for their accepting the risk, and in certain of our excess of loss arrangements, the ultimate amount of which is determined by the loss experience of the business ceded, subject to certain minimum and maximum amounts. Given the length of time that it takes to resolve our claims, many years may elapse before all

Table of Contents 

 losses recoverable under a reinsurance arrangement are known. As a part of the process of estimating our loss reserve we also make estimates regarding the amounts recoverable under our reinsurance arrangements. As a result, we may have an adjustment to our estimate of expected losses and associated recoveries for prior year ceded losses under certain loss sensitive reinsurance agreements. Any changes to estimates of premiums ceded related to prior accident years are fully earned in the period the changes in estimates occur. 
 Ceded premiums written were as follows:

 (1) We generally reinsure risks under our excess of loss reinsurance arrangements pursuant to which the reinsurers agree to assume all or a portion of all risks that we insure above our individual risk retention levels. Premium due to reinsurers is based on a rate factor applied to gross premiums written subject to cession under the arrangement. 
 (2) As previously discussed, as a part of our alternative market solutions, all or a portion of certain medical professional liability premium written is ceded to SPCs in our Segregated Portfolio Cell Reinsurance segment under either excess of loss or quota share reinsurance agreements, depending on the structure of the individual program. Premiums ceded to SPCs were higher during the 2024 three-month period as compared to the same period of 2023 due to the prior year reversal of tail coverage. This tail coverage related to one program in which we do not participate in the underwriting results and was non-renewed effective January 1, 2024. For the 2023 nine-month period, premiums ceded to this SPC totaled 3.4 million (see previous discussion in footnote 2 under the heading "Gross Premiums Written"). The non-renewal of this program is the primary driver of the decrease in premiums ceded to SPCs during the 2024 nine-month period. See the Segment Results - Segregated Portfolio Cell Reinsurance section for further discussion on the cession to the SPCs from our Specialty P C segment. 
 (3) Our other ceded premiums written is primarily comprised of various shared risk arrangements and cyber liability coverages. 
 (4) Given the length of time that it takes to resolve our claims, many years may elapse before all losses recoverable under a reinsurance arrangement are known. As a part of the process of estimating our loss reserve we also make estimates regarding the amounts recoverable under our reinsurance arrangements. As previously discussed, the premiums ultimately ceded under certain of our swing rated excess of loss reinsurance arrangements are subject to the losses ceded under the arrangements. As part of the review of our reserves during the 2024 three- and nine-month periods and 2023 three-month period, we concluded that our estimate of expected losses and associated recoveries for prior year ceded losses was reasonable; therefore, we did not adjust our estimate of ceded premiums owed to reinsurers. As part of our review of our reserves for 2023 nine-month period, we recorded an increase in our estimate of ceded premiums owed to reinsurers due to an increase in our estimate of expected losses and associated recoveries for prior year ceded losses. Changes to estimates of premiums ceded related to prior accident years are fully earned in the period the changes in estimates occur.

 Ceded Premiums Ratio 
 As shown in the table below, our ceded premiums ratio was affected during the 2023 nine-month period by a revision to our estimate of premiums owed to reinsurers related to coverages provided in prior accident years. The ceded premiums ratio was as follows: 
 Three Months Ended September 30 Nine Months Ended September 30 2024 2023 Change 2024 2023 Change Ceded premiums ratio 9.2 5.6 3.6 pts 8.8 9.8 (1.0 pts) Less the effect of adjustments in premiums owed under reinsurance agreements, prior accident years (as previously discussed) pts 0.3 (0.3 pts) Ratio, current accident year 9.2 5.6 3.6 pts 8.8 9.5 (0.7 pts) 
 The above table reflects ceded premiums written, excluding the effect of prior year ceded premium adjustments, as previously discussed, as a percent of gross premiums written. Our current accident year ceded premiums ratio for the 2024 three-month period was higher due to the prior year impact of the cancellation and reversal of tail premium (see previous discussion in footnote 2 under the heading "Gross Premiums Written"). The decrease in our current accident year ceded premium ratio for the 2024 nine-month period was driven by our ceased participation in Syndicate 1729 for the 2024 underwriting year and a decrease in premium ceded to SPCs. 
 Net Premiums Earned 
 Net premiums earned consist of gross premiums earned less the portion of earned premiums that we cede to our reinsurers for their assumption of a portion of our losses. Because premiums are generally earned pro rata over the entire policy period, fluctuations in premiums earned tend to lag those of premiums written. The majority of our policies carry a term of one year; however, some of our Medical Technology Liability policies have a multi-year term. Tail coverage premiums are generally 100 earned in the period written because the policies insure only incidents that occurred in prior periods and are not cancellable. Retroactive coverage premiums are 100 earned at the inception of the contract, as all of the associated underlying loss events occurred in the past. Additionally, any ceded premium changes due to changes to estimates of premiums owed under reinsurance agreements for prior accident years are fully earned in the period of change. 
 Net premiums earned were as follows: 
 Three Months Ended September 30 Nine Months Ended September 30 in thousands) 2024 2023 Change 2024 2023 Change Gross premiums earned 205,908 205,686 222 0.1 614,229 619,730 (5,501) (0.9 Less: Ceded premiums earned 17,204 9,914 7,290 73.5 52,092 57,524 (5,432) (9.4 Net premiums earned 188,704 195,772 (7,068) (3.6 562,137 562,206 (69) 
 Gross premiums earned for the 2023 three-month period reflected the cancellation and reversal of 7.9 million of tail premium in the prior year period, all of which was ceded to an SPC in our Segregated Portfolio Cell Reinsurance segment (see previous discussion in footnote 2 under the heading "Ceded Premiums Written"). Excluding the reversal of that tail premium in the prior year three-month period, gross premiums earned decreased 7.7 million and 5.5 million for the 2024 three- and nine-month periods, respectively, as compared to the same respective periods of 2023 driven by a decrease in the volume of written premium during the preceding twelve months, primarily due to proactive actions taken in certain lines to improve profitability. 
 Ceded premiums earned increased during the 2024 three-month period and decreased for the 2024 nine-month period as compared to the same respective periods of 2023. The increase for the 2024 three-month period was primarily due to the cancellation and reversal of tail premium in the prior year period. Ceded premiums earned during the 2023 nine-month period included a prior accident year ceded premium adjustment of 2.2 million made during the first quarter of 2023 which increased ceded premiums owed under our swing rated reinsurance arrangements related to prior accident year losses (see previous discussion in footnote 4 under the heading "Ceded Premiums Written"). The decrease in ceded premiums earned during the 2024 nine-month period also reflected the pro rata effect of a decrease in premium ceded to SPCs during the preceding twelve months.

 Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses 
 The determination of calendar year losses involves the actuarial evaluation of incurred losses for the current accident year and the actuarial re-evaluation of incurred losses for prior accident years. 
 Accident year refers to the accounting period in which the insured event becomes a liability of the insurer. For claims-made policies, which represent the majority of the premiums written in our Specialty P C segment, the insured event generally becomes a liability when the event is first reported to us and the policy that is in effect at that time covers the claim. For occurrence policies, the insured event becomes a liability when the event takes place even though the claim may be reported to us at a later date. For retroactive coverages, the insured event becomes a liability at inception of the underlying contract. We believe that measuring losses on an accident year basis is the best measure of the underlying profitability of the premiums earned in that period, since it associates policy premiums earned with the estimate of the losses incurred related to those policy premiums. 
 The following table summarizes calendar year net loss ratios for our Specialty P C segment by separating losses between the current accident year and all prior accident years. The net loss ratios for our Specialty P C segment were as follows: 
 Net Loss Ratios (1) 
 Three Months Ended September 30 Nine Months Ended September 30 2024 2023 Change 2024 2023 Change Calendar year net loss ratio 72.2 83.1 (10.9 pts) 77.3 84.7 (7.4 pts) Less impact of prior accident years on the net loss ratio (10.5 (0.3 (10.2 pts) (4.8 0.3 (5.1 pts) Current accident year net loss ratio (2)

As shown in the following table, the change in our current accident year net loss ratios were primarily attributable to the following: 
 (In percentage points) Increase (Decrease) 2024 versus 2023 Comparative three-month periods Comparative nine-month periods Estimated ratio increase (decrease) attributable to: Lloyd's Syndicates 0.8 pts 0.3 pts Change in ULAE 
 (0.4 pts) (0.4 pts) Ceded Premium Adjustment, Prior Accident Years (1) 
 pts (0.4 pts) All other, net (1.1 pts) (1.8 pts) Decrease in current accident year net loss ratio (0.7 pts) (2.3 pts) (1) See previous discussion in footnote 4 under the heading "Ceded Premiums Written" for additional information. 
 
 Excluding the impact of the items specifically identified in the table above, our current accident year net loss ratios for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same respective periods of 2023 improved 1.1 and 1.8 percentage points, respectively, driven by our continued underwriting and pricing actions which have resulted in a decrease to certain expected loss ratios within our MPL line of business, partially offset by changes in the mix of business. 
 ULAE are costs that cannot be attributed to processing a specific claim and are allocated to net losses and loss adjustment expenses from underwriting and operating expenses. We estimate ULAE at the beginning of each year based on projected allocable expenses and periodically adjust if actual expenses differ from our initial estimate. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, ULAE decreased due to lower actual headcount in our claims department as well as lower allocable IT expenses. 
 We re-evaluate our previously established reserve each quarter based upon the most recently completed actuarial analysis supplemented by any new analysis, information or trends that have emerged since the date of that study. We also take into account currently available industry trend information.

 We recognized net favorable (unfavorable) prior accident year reserve development as follows: 
 Three Months Ended September 30 Nine Months Ended September 30 in thousands) 2024 2023 Change 2024 2023 Change Total net favorable (unfavorable) reserve development 19,732 653 19,079 2,921.7 27,163 (1,710) 28,873 1,688.5 
 The following table shows net favorable (unfavorable) development by component for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: 
 
 MPL: The loss environment in our MPL line of business continues to be challenging in many jurisdictions, as claim costs are pressured by social inflation and higher than anticipated loss severity trends that started to reemerge in the fourth quarter of 2022. We continue to monitor the impact that these trends have on our open case reserves and prior accident year development. While higher loss severity trends remain challenging in 2024, we recognized net favorable reserve development for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 reflecting overall favorable trends in claim closing patterns relative to expectations, principally related to accident years 2018 and prior in our legacy book and, for the 2024 three-month period, the 2021 accident year our NORCAL book. In 2023, we strengthened case reserves related to four large claims during the first quarter of 2023, resulting in 10.1 million of unfavorable development, primarily related to NORCAL's accident years 2016 and 2020. 
 Medical Technology Liability : During both the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recognized net favorable reserve development due to lower than anticipated loss emergence. Net favorable development recognized in the 2024 nine-month period principally related to accident years 2019 through 2023 whereas development recognized in the 2023 nine-month period principally related to accident years 2014 through 2017. 
 Lloyd's Syndicates : Net favorable reserve development associated with our Lloyd's Syndicates operations during the three months ended September 30, 2024 was driven by lower than expected losses and development on certain large claims. Net unfavorable reserve development associated with our Lloyd's Syndicates operations during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 was driven by higher than expected losses and development on certain large claims, primarily catastrophe related losses.

Table of Contents 

 Purchase Accounting Amortization : Net prior year reserve development for all periods presented included amortization of the purchase accounting fair value adjustment on NORCAL's assumed net reserve and amortization of the negative VOBA associated with NORCAL's DDR reserve which is recorded as a reduction to net losses and loss adjustment expenses. 
 A detailed discussion of factors influencing our recognition of loss development is included in our Critical Accounting Estimates section under the heading "Reserve for Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses" in our December 31, 2023 report on Form 10-K. Assumptions used in establishing our reserve are regularly reviewed and updated by management as new data becomes available. Any adjustments necessary are reflected in the then current operations. Due to the size of our reserve, even a small percentage adjustment to the assumptions can have a material effect on our results of operations for the period in which the change is made, as was the case in both 2024 and 2023. 
 
 Underwriting, Policy Acquisition and Operating Expenses 
 Our Specialty P C segment underwriting, policy acquisition and operating expenses were comprised as follows: 
 Three Months Ended September 30 Nine Months Ended September 30 in thousands) 2024 2023 Change 2024 2023 Change DPAC amortization 25,238 27,129 (1,891) (7.0 76,839 75,577 1,262 1.7 Management fees 1,169 1,201 (32) (2.7 3,095 3,164 (69) (2.2 Other underwriting and operating expenses 25,085 21,065 4,020 19.1 73,481 62,208 11,273 18.1 Total 51,492 49,395 2,097 4.2 153,415 140,949 12,466 8.8 
 DPAC amortization decreased for the 2024 three-month period and increased for the 2024 nine-month period as compared to the same respective periods of 2023. The decrease for the 2024 three-month period was primarily driven by an increase in ceding commission income, which is an offset to expense, partially offset by an increase in capitalized compensation-related costs. Ceding commission income in the 2024 three-month period was higher than the prior year period driven by the reversal of commission income in the third quarter of 2023 that was initially recorded in the second quarter of 2023 associated with a large tail policy written and ceded to an SPC in our Segregated Portfolio Cell Reinsurance segment (see previous discussion under the heading "Gross Premiums Written"). The increase for the 2024 nine-month period was primarily driven by an increase in capitalized compensation-related costs, as previously discussed, partially offset by a decrease in brokerage expenses as compared to the same period of 2023. 
 Management fees are charged pursuant to a management agreement by the Corporate segment to the core domestic operating subsidiaries within our Specialty P C segment for services provided based on the extent to which services are provided to the subsidiary and the amount of premium written by the subsidiary. While the terms of the management agreement were generally consistent between 2024 and 2023, fluctuations in the amount of premium written by each subsidiary can result in corresponding variations in the management fee charged to each subsidiary during a particular period. 
 Other underwriting and operating expenses increased for the 2024 three- and nine-month periods as compared to the same respective periods of 2023 primarily attributable to the following: 
 Prior year impact of certain one-time items that are unique or non-recurring in nature recorded during the first quarter of 2023 that resulted in a benefit to operating expenses. We recognized a claim for a payroll tax refund of 3.8 million related to the employee retention credit and a reduction to operating expenses of 1 million related to the reduction to the contingent consideration liability associated with the NORCAL acquisition. See additional discussion on these items in our September 30, 2023 report on Form 10-Q within Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis, in the Segment Results - Specialty Property Casualty section under the heading "Underwriting, Policy Acquisition and Operating Expenses." 
 An increase in compensation-related expenses, partially offset by lower professional fees. The increase in compensation-related costs in the 2024 three- and nine-month periods was primarily due to higher amounts accrued for performance-related incentive plans due to the improvement in the related performance metrics. The decrease in professional fees for the 2024 three- and nine-month periods was driven by a reduction in fees associated with a data analytics services agreement, a decrease in consulting fees and, for the 2024 nine-month period, lower external audit fees. The remaining variance in other underwriting and operating expenses for the 2024 three- and nine-month periods as compared to the same respective periods of 2023 was comprised of individually insignificant components.

 Underwriting Expense Ratio (the Expense Ratio) 
 Our expense ratio for the Specialty P C segment was as follows: 
 Three Months Ended September 30 Nine Months Ended September 30 2024 2023 Change 2024 2023 Change Underwriting expense ratio 
 27.3 25.2 2.1 pts 27.3 25.1 2.2 pts 
 The change in our expense ratios for the 2024 three- and nine-month periods as compared to the same respective periods of 2023 were primarily attributable to the following: 
 Increase (Decrease) 
 2024 versus 2023 
 (In percentage points) Comparative three-month periods Comparative nine-month periods 
 Estimated ratio increase (decrease) attributable to: Change in Net Premiums Earned and DPAC amortization

 2.1 pts 2.2 pts 
 As shown in the previous table, our underwriting expense ratio for the 2024 three-month period reflected lower DPAC amortization in relation to the decline in net premiums earned resulting in a 0.5 percentage point decrease in our current period ratio as compared to the same period of 2023. The change in DPAC amortization in relation to the change in net premiums earned had a minimal impact on our underwriting expense ratio for the 2024 nine-month period as compared to the same period of 2023. See previous discussion under the heading "DPAC Amortization." 
 Excluding the impact of the items specifically identified in the table above, our expense ratio for the 2024 three- and nine-month periods increased by 2.6 and 1.1 percentage points, respectively, as compared to the same respective periods of 2023 driven by an increase in compensation-related costs, partially offset by lower professional fees. 
 
 Segment Results - Workers' Compensation Insurance 
 Our Workers' Compensation Insurance segment includes workers' compensation products provided to employers generally with 1,000 or fewer employees, as discussed in Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in our December 31, 2023 report on Form 10-K. Segment results included the following:

 Premiums Written 
 Our workers compensation premium volume is driven by five primary factors: (1) the amount of new business written, (2) retention of our existing book of business, (3) premium rates charged on our renewal book of business, (4) changes in payroll exposure and (5) audit premium. 
 Gross, ceded and net premiums written were as follows:

 (1) Gross premiums written increased for the 2024 three- and nine-month periods as compared to the same respective periods of 2023 driven by higher renewal business and audit premium. Renewal business reflected an improvement in renewal pricing and an increase in payroll exposure. Additionally, renewal business included the renewal of certain policies as traditional business that were previously written in one of the alternative market programs in our Segregated Portfolio Cell Reinsurance segment, totaling 1.4 million and 3.0 million for the 2024 three- and nine-month periods, respectively. Renewal pricing increases for the 2024 three-month period are primarily attributable to one large policy. Excluding this large policy, renewal pricing for the 2024 three-month period was a decrease of 1 . Gross premiums written in our traditional business also reflect the continuation of competitive workers' compensation market conditions, including the impact of compounded state loss cost reductions in our core operating territories. 
 (2) A majority of alternative market premiums are ceded to SPCs in our Segregated Portfolio Cell Reinsurance segment. See further discussion on alternative market gross premiums written in our Segment Results - Segregated Portfolio Cell Reinsurance section under the heading "Gross Premiums Written" that follows. We retained seventeen of the nineteen (three in the third quarter) workers compensation alternative market programs that were up for renewal during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Effective January 1, 2024, two programs were non-renewed and placed into run-off; however, as the underlying policies expire in one program, we expect those policies to be renewed as traditional business in our Workers' Compensation Insurance segment, as previously discussed. The other program, in which we do not participate in the underwriting results, assumed both workers' compensation insurance and medical professional liability insurance and we elected to non-renew this program.

 (2) Premiums ceded under our traditional reinsurance treaty are based on premiums earned during the treaty period. The increase for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same respective periods of 2023 reflected a higher average reinsurance rate and, for the 2024 nine-month period, reinstatement premium of 0.7 million that was recognized during the second quarter of 2024 related to a reserve increase on a prior year reinsured claim.

 Ceded Premiums Ratio 
 Ceded premiums ratio was as follows:

 The above table reflects traditional ceded premiums earned as a percent of traditional gross premiums earned. As discussed above, premiums ceded under our traditional reinsurance treaty are based on premiums earned during the treaty period. The increase in the ceded premiums ratios for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily reflects a higher average reinsurance rate. 
 Net Premiums Earned 
 Net premiums earned consist of gross premiums earned less the portion of earned premiums that we cede to SPCs in our Segregated Portfolio Cell Reinsurance segment, external reinsurers (including changes related to the return premium and revenue share estimates) and the unaffiliated captive insurers. Because premiums are generally earned pro rata over the entire policy period, fluctuations in premiums earned tend to lag those of premiums written. Our workers compensation policies are twelve month term policies, and premiums are earned on a pro rata basis over the policy period. Net premiums earned also include premium adjustments related to the audit of our insureds' payrolls, changes in our estimates related to EBUB and premium adjustments related to retrospectively-rated policies. Payroll audits are conducted subsequent to the end of the policy period and any related premium adjustments are recorded as fully earned in the current period. We evaluate our estimates related to EBUB and retrospectively-rated premium adjustments on a quarterly basis with any adjustments being included in written and earned premium in the current period. 
 Net premiums earned were as follows: 
 Three Months Ended September 30 Nine Months Ended September 30 in thousands) 2024 2023 Change 2024 2023 Change Gross premiums earned 61,822 60,734 1,088 1.8 185,440 184,044 1,396 0.8 Less: Ceded premiums earned 19,993 20,849 (856) (4.1 60,748 62,338 (1,590) (2.6 Net premiums earned 41,829 39,885 1,944 4.9 124,692 121,706 2,986 2.5 
 Net premiums earned increased during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same respective periods of 2023 driven by higher audit premium and the renewal of certain policies as traditional business that were previously written in one of the alternative market programs in our Segregated Portfolio Cell Reinsurance segment. The increase in net premiums earned for the 2024 nine-month period was partially offset by the change in our carried EBUB estimate. 
 
 Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses 
 We estimate our current accident year loss and loss adjustment expenses by developing actual reported losses using historical loss development factors, adjusted to reflect current and expected trends based on various internal analyses and supplemental information. The following table summarizes calendar year net loss ratios by separating losses between the current accident year and all prior accident years. Calendar year and current accident year net loss ratios by component were as follows: 
 Three Months Ended September 30 Nine Months Ended September 30 2024 2023 Change 2024 2023 Change Calendar year net loss ratio 77.0 103.3 (26.3 pts) 77.0 83.7 (6.7 pts) Less impact of prior accident years on the net loss ratio 20.2 (20.2 pts) 7.7 (7.7 pts) Current accident year net loss ratio 77.0 83.1 (6.1 pts) 77.0 76.0 1.0 pts

Table of Contents 

 The current accident year net loss ratio of 77 for the 2024 three- and nine-month periods improved 4.3 points from the current accident year net loss ratio of 81.3 for the year ended December 31, 2023. While we continue to observe, and therefore reflect, higher medical loss cost trends, we have seen these trends begin to moderate during the first nine months of 2024. During the 2023 third quarter, we increased our 2023 full-year loss ratio to 76 , from 72.6 , to reflect higher than expected average claim costs which resulted in a current accident year net loss ratio of 83.1 for the 2023 three-month period. 
 Calendar year incurred losses (excluding IBNR) in excess of our per occurrence reinsurance retention, before consideration of the AAD, increased 0.5 million and 1.6 million for the 2024 three- and nine-month periods, respectively, as compared to the same respective periods of 2023, which reflected net unfavorable reserve development on reinsured claims. We recognized losses within the AAD totaling 2.0 million for the 2024 nine-month period as compared to 1.5 million and 4.3 million for the 2023 three- and nine-month periods, respectively. We continue to recognize losses within the AAD at the maximum exposure, based on historical reinsured loss trends; however, actual results within the AAD layer may ultimately be lower once all claims have been settled. Further, the May 1, 2024 reinsurance treaty renewal included the elimination of the AAD. 
 We did not recognize any prior accident year reserve development for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. We recognized 8.1 million and 9.3 million of net unfavorable prior accident year reserve development for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, reflecting higher than expected average claim costs primarily in the 2022 accident year and, for the 2023 nine-month period, a large claim from the 1997 accident year. 
 
 Underwriting, Policy Acquisition and Operating Expenses 
 Underwriting, policy acquisition and operating expenses include the amortization of commissions, premium taxes and underwriting salaries, which are capitalized and deferred over the related workers compensation policy period, net of ceding commissions earned. The capitalization of underwriting salaries can vary as they are subject to the success rate of our contract acquisition efforts. These expenses also include a management fee charged by our Corporate segment, which represents intercompany charges pursuant to a management agreement. The management fee is based on the extent to which services are provided to the subsidiary and the amount of premium written by the subsidiary. 
 Our Workers' Compensation Insurance segment underwriting, policy acquisition and operating expenses were comprised as follows: 
 Three Months Ended September 30 Nine Months Ended September 30 in thousands) 2024 2023 Change 2024 2023 Change DPAC amortization 6,692 7,517 (825) (11.0 21,495 21,961 (466) (2.1 Management fees 480 478 2 0.4 1,479 1,494 (15) (1.0 Other underwriting and operating expenses 10,440 9,132 1,308 14.3 31,108 28,230 2,878 10.2 SPC ceding commission offset (3,229) (3,585) 356 (9.9 (10,074) (10,762) 688 (6.4 Total 14,383 13,542 841 6.2 44,008 40,923 3,085 7.5 
 DPAC amortization decreased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same respective periods of 2023, reflecting a recovery of a guaranty fund assessment totaling 0.9 million during the third quarter of 2024. After removing the effect of the guaranty fund recoupment, DPAC amortization increased by 0.1 million and 0.5 million for the 2024 three- and nine-month periods, respectively, reflecting an increase in gross premiums earned. 
 Other underwriting and operating expenses increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same respective periods of 2023, primarily reflecting an increase in compensation-related and information technology costs. The increase in compensation-related costs during the 2024 three- and nine-month periods primarily reflected higher amounts accrued for performance-related incentive plans due to an improvement in the related performance metrics and an increase in salaries due to annual merit adjustments. Information technology costs increased during the 2024 three- and nine-month periods reflecting our investment in initiatives that will enhance underwriting and claim operating efficiencies. 
 As previously discussed, alternative market premiums written by our Workers' Compensation Insurance segment are 100 ceded, less a ceding commission, to either the SPCs in our Segregated Portfolio Cell Reinsurance segment or unaffiliated captive insurers. The ceding commission charged to the SPCs consists of an amount for fronting fees, cell rental fees, commissions, premium taxes, claims administration fees and risk management fees. The fronting fees, commissions, premium taxes and risk management fees are recorded as an offset to underwriting, policy acquisition and operating expenses. Cell rental fees are recorded as a component of other income and claims administration fees are recorded as ceded ULAE. SPC ceding commissions earned decreased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same respective periods of 2023 primarily reflecting the non-renewal of the two alternative market programs effective January 1, 2024 and the related decrease in ceded premium.

 Three Months Ended September 30 Nine Months Ended September 30 2024 2023 Change 2024 2023 Change Underwriting expense ratio, as reported 34.4 34.0 0.4 pts 35.3 33.6 1.7 pts Less estimated ratio increase (decrease) attributable to: Impact of ceding commissions received from SPCs 4.1 4.1 pts 1.1 3.9 (2.8 pts) Impact of audit premium (2.3 (1.2 (1.1 pts) (2.3 (1.8 (0.5 pts) Underwriting expense ratio, less listed effects 32.6 31.1 1.5 pts 36.5 31.5 5.0 pts 
 Excluding the items noted in the table above, the expense ratios increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily reflecting the increase in other underwriting and operating expenses, as previously discussed. 
 
 Segment Results - Segregated Portfolio Cell Reinsurance 
 The Segregated Portfolio Cell Reinsurance segment includes the results (underwriting profit or loss, plus investment results, net of U.S. federal income taxes) of SPCs at Inova Re and Eastern Re, our Cayman Islands SPC operations, as discussed in Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in our December 31, 2023 report on Form 10-K. SPCs are segregated pools of assets and liabilities that provide an insurance facility for a defined set of risks. Assets of each SPC are solely for the benefit of that individual cell and each SPC is solely responsible for the liabilities of that individual cell. Assets of one SPC are statutorily protected from the creditors of the others. As of September 30, 2024, there were twenty-six (five inactive) SPCs. Effective January 1, 2024, two SPCs were non-renewed and placed into run-off. As the underlying policies expire that were previously written in one of the programs, we expect a majority of those policies to be renewed as traditional business in our Workers' Compensation Insurance segment. The other program, in which we do not participate in the underwriting results, assumed both workers' compensation insurance and medical professional liability insurance. For the year ended December 31, 2023, these SPCs had workers' compensation and medical professional liability premiums written totaling 6.4 million and 3.4 million, respectively. 
 Segment results reflect our share of the underwriting and investment results of the SPCs in which we participate, and included the following:

 Premiums Written 
 Premiums in our Segregated Portfolio Cell Reinsurance segment are assumed from either our Workers' Compensation Insurance or Specialty P C segments. Premium volume is driven by five primary factors: (1) the amount of new business written, (2) retention of the existing book of business, (3) premium rates charged on the renewal book of business and, for workers' compensation business, (4) changes in payroll exposure and (5) audit premium. 
 Gross, ceded and net premiums written were as follows: 
 Three Months Ended September 30 Nine Months Ended September 30 in thousands) 2024 2023 Change 2024 2023 Change Gross premiums written 
 13,650 7,930 5,720 72.1 45,467 55,924 (10,457) (18.7 Less: Ceded premiums written

 Gross Premiums Written 
 Gross premiums written reflected reinsurance premiums assumed by component as follows: 
 Three Months Ended September 30 Nine Months Ended September 30 in thousands) 2024 2023 Change 2024 2023 Change Workers' compensation 
 13,156 15,745 (2,589) (16.4 42,993 50,454 (7,461) (14.8 Medical professional liability

 Gross premiums written for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were primarily comprised of workers' compensation coverages assumed from our Workers' Compensation Insurance segment. Workers' compensation gross premiums written decreased during the 2024 three- and nine-month periods as compared to the same respective periods of 2023 due to the non-renewal of two programs effective January 1, 2024, as previously discussed. 
 The increase in medical professional liability gross premiums written for the 2024 three-month period as compared to the same period of 2023 primarily reflected the prior year cancellation and reversal of 7.9 million of tail premium previously written and fully earned during the second quarter of 2023. This tail premium related to one program in which we do not participate in the underwriting results and was non-renewed effective January 1, 2024, as discussed above. See further discussion in our Segment Results - Specialty Property Casualty section under the heading "Premiums Written." 
 We retained fifteen of the seventeen (three in the third quarter of 2024) workers' compensation programs and one of the two medical professional liability programs up for renewal during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 New business, audit premium, retention and renewal price changes for the assumed workers' compensation premium is shown in the table below: 
 Three Months Ended September 30 Nine Months Ended September 30 in millions) 2024 2023 2024 2023 New business 0.7 0.6 2.8 3.3 Audit premium 0.7 0.6 3.1 2.7 Retention rate (1)

 (2 (5 (1 (5 (1) We calculate our workers' compensation retention rate as annualized expiring renewed premium divided by all annualized expiring premium subject to renewal. Our retention rate can be impacted by various factors, including price or other competitive issues, insureds being acquired, or a decision not to renew based on our underwriting evaluation. 
 (2) The pricing of our business includes an assessment of the underlying policy exposure and market conditions. We continue to base our pricing on expected losses, as indicated by our historical loss data.

 Ceded Premiums Written 
 Ceded premiums written were as follows: 
 Three Months Ended September 30 Nine Months Ended September 30 in thousands) 2024 2023 Change 2024 2023 Change Ceded premiums written 1,912 2,181 (269) (12.3 6,210 7,171 (961) (13.4 
 For the workers' compensation business, each SPC has in place its own external reinsurance coverage. The medical professional liability business is assumed net of reinsurance from our Specialty P C segment; therefore, there are no ceded premiums related to the medical professional liability business reflected in the table above. Premiums ceded under our SPC reinsurance treaty are based on premiums written during the treaty period. The change in ceded premiums written during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same respective periods of 2023 primarily reflected the decrease in workers' compensation gross premiums written and the impact of rate changes under the external reinsurance treaty. External reinsurance rates vary based on the alternative market program. 
 Ceded Premiums Ratio 
 Ceded premiums ratio was as follows: 
 Three Months Ended September 30 Nine Months Ended September 30 2024 2023 Change 2024 2023 Change Ceded premiums ratio 14.5 13.9 0.6 pts 14.4 14.2 0.2 pts 
 The above table reflects ceded premiums as a percent of gross premiums written for the workers' compensation business only; medical professional liability business is assumed net of reinsurance, as discussed above. The ceded premiums ratio reflects the weighted average reinsurance rates of all SPC programs. 
 Net Premiums Earned 
 Net premiums earned consist of gross premiums earned less the portion of earned premiums that the SPCs cede to external reinsurers. Because premiums are generally earned pro rata over the entire policy period, fluctuations in premiums earned tend to lag those of premiums written. Policies ceded to the SPCs are twelve month term policies and premiums are earned on a pro rata basis over the policy period. Net premiums earned also include premium adjustments related to the audit of workers' compensation insureds' payrolls. Payroll audits are conducted subsequent to the end of the policy period and any related adjustments are recorded as fully earned in the current period. 
 Gross, ceded and net premiums earned were as follows: 
 Three Months Ended September 30 Nine Months Ended September 30 in thousands) 2024 2023 Change 2024 2023 Change Gross premiums earned 14,613 9,008 5,605 62.2 46,648 53,001 (6,353) (12.0 Less: Ceded premiums earned 1,986 2,245 (259) (11.5 6,301 6,845 (544) (7.9 Net premiums earned 12,627 6,763 5,864 86.7 40,347 46,156 (5,809) (12.6 
 The increase in net premiums earned during the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period of 2023 was primarily driven by the prior year impact of the cancellation and reversal of tail premium, as previously discussed. The decrease in net premiums earned during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period of 2023 reflected the non-renewal of two SPCs effective January 1, 2024. 
 
 Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses 
 The following table summarizes the calendar year net loss ratios by separating losses between the current accident year and all prior accident years. The current accident year net loss ratio reflects the aggregate loss ratio for all programs. Loss reserves and associated reinsurance are estimated for each program on a quarterly basis. Each SPC has in place its own reinsurance agreement, and the attachment point of aggregate reinsurance coverage varies by program. Due to the size of some of the programs, quarterly loss results, including changes in estimated aggregate reinsurance, can create volatility in the current accident year net loss ratio from period to period.

Table of Contents 

 Calendar year and current accident year net loss ratios for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were as follows: 
 Three Months Ended September 30 Nine Months Ended September 30 2024 2023 Change 2024 2023 Change Calendar year net loss ratio 
 61.8 74.0 (12.2 pts) 65.6 59.0 6.6 pts Less impact of prior accident years on the net loss ratio

 77.9 70.5 7.4 pts 69.5 64.7 4.8 pts 
 The current accident year net loss ratio increased for the 2024 three- and nine-month periods as compared to the same respective periods of 2023 primarily reflecting an increase in claim severity. 
 Calendar year incurred losses (excluding IBNR) ceded to our external reinsurers increased 7.2 million and 6.8 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to the same respective periods of 2023. Current accident year ceded incurred losses (excluding IBNR) increased 6.2 million and 7.0 million for the 2024 three- and nine-month periods, respectively, as compared to the same respective periods of 2023. 
 We recognized net favorable prior year reserve development of 2.1 million and 1.5 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. The development for the 2024 three- and nine-month periods includes net favorable development in the workers' compensation business of 2.1 million and 2.9 million, respectively, which reflected overall favorable trends in claim closing patterns primarily in accident years 2020 through 2022. Partially offsetting the favorable development for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 is net unfavorable development of 1.4 million in the medical professional liability business in the first quarter of 2024, which primarily reflected higher than expected claim frequency in the program that assumed both workers' compensation and medical professional liability insurance, which was non-renewed effective January 1, 2024. We do not participate in the underwriting results of this program. 
 Development for the 2023 three- and nine-month periods includes net favorable development in the workers' compensation business of 1.1 million and 3.9 million, respectively, and net unfavorable development of 1.4 million in each period in the medical professional liability business. The development related to the workers' compensation business for the 2023 three- and nine-month periods reflected overall favorable trends in claim closing patterns primarily in accident years 2018 through 2021. The net unfavorable development in the medical professional liability business primarily reflected higher than expected claim frequency in one program in which we do not participate in the underwriting results. 
 
 Underwriting, Policy Acquisition and Operating Expenses 
 Our Segregated Portfolio Cell Reinsurance segment underwriting, policy acquisition and operating expenses were comprised as follows: 
 Three Months Ended September 30 Nine Months Ended September 30 in thousands) 2024 2023 Change 2024 2023 Change DPAC amortization 3,921 3,152 769 24.4 12,517 13,759 (1,242) (9.0 Other underwriting and operating expenses 222 516 (294) (57.0 1,588 1,482 106 7.2 Total 
 4,143 3,668 475 12.9 14,105 15,241 (1,136) (7.5 
 DPAC amortization primarily represents ceding commissions, which vary by program and are paid to our Workers' Compensation Insurance and Specialty P C segments for premiums assumed. Ceding commissions include an amount for fronting fees, commissions, premium taxes and risk management fees, which are reported as an offset to underwriting, policy acquisition and operating expenses within our Workers' Compensation Insurance and Specialty P C segments. In addition, ceding commissions paid to our Workers' Compensation Insurance segment include cell rental fees which are recorded as other income and claims administration fees which are recorded as ceded ULAE within our Workers' Compensation Insurance segment. DPAC amortization for the 2023 three-month period included the reversal of 1.2 million of ceding commission related to the cancellation of the medical professional liability tail coverage, as previously discussed. Excluding the prior year impact of this tail policy's ceding commission, DPAC amortization decreased for the 2024 three-month period as compared to the same period of 2023. The decrease in DPAC amortization for the 2024 three- and nine-month periods primarily reflected the decrease in earned premium, as discussed above under the heading "Net Premiums Earned." 
 Other underwriting and operating expenses primarily include bank fees, professional fees, changes in the allowance for expected credit losses and policyholder dividend expense. Other underwriting and operating expenses decreased for the 2024 three-month period and remained relatively unchanged for the 2024 nine-month period as compared to the same respective periods of 2023. The decrease in the 2024 three-month period was driven by the change in the allowance for credit losses.

 Underwriting Expense Ratio (the Expense Ratio) 
 The underwriting expense ratios included the impact of the following: 
 Three Months Ended September 30 Nine Months Ended September 30 2024 2023 Change 2024 2023 Change Underwriting expense ratio, as reported 32.8 54.2 (21.4 pts) 35.0 33.0 2.0 pts Less: impact of audit premium on expense ratio (1.9 (5.1 3.2 pts (2.9 (1.9 1.0 pts Underwriting expense ratio, excluding the effect of audit premium 34.7 59.3 (24.6 pts) 37.9 34.9 3.0 pts 
 Excluding the effect of audit premium, the underwriting expense ratio decreased for the 2024 three-month period as compared the same period of 2023 driven by the prior year impact of the reversal of ceding commissions related to the cancellation of medical professional liability tail coverage, as previously discussed, which was previously written and earned during the second quarter of 2023 and was subject to a lower ceding commission and a decrease in the allowance for credit losses. The increase in the underwriting expense ratio for the 2024 nine-month period was primarily driven by a decrease in net premiums earned, as previously discussed. 
 
 Segment Results - Corporate 
 Our Corporate segment includes our investment operations excluding those reported in our Segregated Portfolio Cell Reinsurance segment as discussed in Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in our December 31, 2023 report on Form 10-K. In addition, this segment includes corporate expenses, interest expense, U.S. and U.K. income taxes and non-premium revenues generated outside of our insurance entities. 
 Segment results for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 exclude the change in fair value of contingent consideration and, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, transaction-related costs, including the associated income tax benefit, as we do not consider these items in assessing the financial performance of the segment. Transaction-related costs are attributable to actuarial consulting fees paid during the second quarter of 2024 in relation to the final determination of contingent consideration associated with the NORCAL acquisition. We did not incur any transaction-related costs in the three months ended September 30, 2024 or the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. Segment results for our Corporate segment were net earnings of 18.2 million and 65.1 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to 22.1 million and 63.3 million for the same respective periods of 2023, and included the following:

 Net Investment Income 
 Net investment income is primarily derived from the income earned by our fixed maturity securities and also includes dividend income from equity securities, income from our short-term and cash equivalent investments, earnings from other investments and changes in the cash surrender value of BOLI contracts, net of investment fees and expenses. 
 Net investment income (loss) by investment category was as follows: 
 Three Months Ended September 30 Nine Months Ended September 30 in thousands) 2024 2023 Change 2024 2023 Change Fixed maturities 33,546 28,035 5,511 19.7 97,567 82,669 14,898 18.0 Equities 1,197 1,158 39 3.4 3,253 3,070 183 6.0 Short-term investments, including Other 2,623 4,156 (1,533) (36.9 8,318 10,948 (2,630) (24.0 BOLI 1,101 668 433 64.8 2,087 1,784 303 17.0 Investment fees and expenses (2,204) (1,864) (340) 18.2 (6,185) (5,382) (803) 14.9 Net investment income 36,263 32,153 4,110 12.8 105,040 93,089 11,951 12.8 
 Fixed Maturities 
 Income from our fixed maturities increased during the 2024 three- and nine-month periods as compared to the same respective periods of 2023 driven by higher average book yields as we take advantage of the current interest rate environment as our portfolio matures. Additionally, average investment balances were approximately 4.1 and 1.7 higher for the 2024 three- and nine-month periods, respectively, as compared to the same respective periods of 2023. 
 Average yields for our fixed maturity portfolio were as follows: 
 Three Months Ended September 30 Nine Months Ended September 30 2024 2023 2024 2023 Average income yield 3.5 3.1 3.5 3.0 Average tax equivalent income yield 3.5 3.1 3.5 3.0 
 Short-term Investments and Other Investments 
 Short-term investments, which have a maturity at purchase of one year or less are carried at fair value, which approximates their cost basis, and are primarily composed of investments in U.S. treasury obligations, commercial paper, money market funds and a certificate of deposit. Income from our short-term and other investments decreased during the 2024 three- and nine-month periods as compared to the same respective periods of 2023 primarily due to lower average investment balances and lower yields given the decrease in interest rates. 
 BOLI 
 We hold BOLI policies that are carried at the current cash surrender value of the policies. All insured individuals were members of management at the time the policies were acquired. Income from our BOLI policies increased for the 2024 three- and nine-month periods as compared to the same respective periods of 2023 primarily attributable to an increase in the cash surrender value. 
 Investment Fees and Expenses 
 Investment fees and expenses increased for the 2024 three- and nine-month periods as compared to the same respective periods of 2023 primarily due to the mix of investment managers as well as an increase in service costs. 
 Equity in Earnings (Loss) of Unconsolidated Subsidiaries 
 Equity in earnings (loss) of unconsolidated subsidiaries was comprised as follows: 
 Three Months Ended September 30 Nine Months Ended September 30 in thousands) 2024 2023 Change 2024 2023 Change All other investments, primarily investment fund LPs/LLCs 
 5,218 368 4,850 1,317.9 16,546 7,744 8,802 113.7 Tax credit partnerships (451) (429) (22) 5.1 (163) (2,294) 2,131 (92.9 Equity in earnings (loss) of unconsolidated subsidiaries 4,767 (61) 4,828 7,914.8 16,383 5,450 10,933 200.6

Table of Contents 

 We hold interests in certain LPs/LLCs that generate earnings from trading portfolios, secured debt, debt securities, multi-strategy funds and private equity investments. The performance of the LPs/LLCs is affected by the volatility of equity and credit markets. For our investments in LPs/LLCs, we record our allocable portion of the partnership operating income or loss as the results of the LPs/LLCs become available, typically following the end of a reporting period. Our investment results from our portfolio of investments in LPs/LLCs increased for the 2024 three- and nine-month periods as compared to the same respective periods of 2023 primarily due to the performance of certain LPs/LLCs which reflected higher market valuations during the first half of 2024 and, for the 2024 nine-month period, the fourth quarter of 2023. 
 Our tax credit partnership investments are designed to generate returns in the form of tax credits and tax-deductible project operating losses and are comprised of qualified affordable housing project tax credit partnerships and a historic tax credit partnership. We account for our tax credit partnership investments under the equity method and record our allocable portion of the operating losses of the underlying properties based on estimates provided by the partnerships. These tax credit partnership investments are reaching the end of their lifecycle, therefore partnership operating losses and tax benefits associated with these investments have been and are expected to continue to be nominal in amount. However, we may receive distributions from time to time due to the sale of properties. The results from our tax credit partnership investments for the 2024 nine-month period also reflect the benefit of a decrease in our estimate of our allocable portion of operating losses of 0.6 million as compared to an increase in this estimate of 1.3 million during the prior year period. See additional information on our tax credit partnership investments in Note 3 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 Net Investment Gains (Losses)

 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized 1.8 million and 3.3 million of credit-related impairment losses in earnings, respectively, primarily related to four corporate bonds in the real estate sector. We recognized a nominal amount of non-credit impairment losses in OCI in the 2024 nine-month period related to a corporate bond in the consumer sector. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recognized a nominal amount and 3.1 million of credit-related impairment losses in earnings, respectively, related to a mortgage-backed security and, for the 2023 nine-month period, two corporate bonds in the financial sector. 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized 1.7 million of net investment gains driven by unrealized holding gains resulting from changes in the fair value of our equity investments. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized 3.9 million of net investment losses driven by realized losses from the sale of certain available-for-sale fixed maturities. The components of net investment losses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 also reflect realized losses from the sale of certain other investments, the majority of which are convertible securities, offset by the change in unrealized holding gains on other investments, reflecting a decrease in our allocation to this asset category to reinvest in available-for-sale fixed maturities at higher rates.

 We recognized 3.7 million and 3.2 million of net investment losses during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, driven by unrealized holding losses resulting from changes in the fair value of our equity investments, partially offset by death benefit proceeds from BOLI contracts and, for the 2023 nine-month period, unrealized holding gains resulting from changes in the fair value of our convertible securities. 
 
 Other Income (Expense) 
 Corporate other income (expense) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same respective periods of 2023 was comprised of the following: 
 Three Months Ended September 30 Nine Months Ended September 30 in thousands) 2024 2023 Change 
 2024 2023 Change Foreign currency exchange rate gains (losses) (1) 
 (3,849) 1,679 (5,528) (329.2 (1,409) 491 (1,900) (387.0 Other 
 1,102 1,168 (66) (5.7 3,690 4,856 (1,166) (24.0 Total other income (expense) (2,747) 2,847 (5,594) (196.5 2,281 5,347 (3,066) (57.3 (1) See further information on foreign currency exchange rate gains (losses) in the Executive Summary of Operations section under the heading "Revenues." 
 
 Excluding foreign currency exchange rate gains (losses), other income remained relatively unchanged for the 2024 three-month period and decreased for the 2024 nine-month period as compared to the same respective periods of 2023. The decrease in the 2024 nine-month period was driven by proceeds of 1.5 million received in the second quarter of 2023 associated with the sale of a portion of our ownership interest in the underwriting and operations entity associated with Syndicate 1729 to an unrelated third party. 
 
 Operating Expenses 
 Corporate segment operating expenses were comprised as follows: 
 Three Months Ended September 30 Nine Months Ended September 30 in thousands) 2024 2023 Change 2024 2023 Change Operating expenses 12,991 10,023 2,968 29.6 34,386 29,481 4,905 16.6 Management fee offset (1,649) (1,679) 30 (1.8 (4,574) (4,658) 84 (1.8 Total 11,342 8,344 2,998 35.9 29,812 24,823 4,989 20.1 
 Operating expenses increased for the 2024 three- and nine-month periods by 3.0 million and 4.9 million, respectively, as compared to the same respective periods of 2023 driven by an increase in compensation-related costs and, to a lesser extent, travel-related costs, partially offset by a decrease in professional fees. The increase in compensation-related costs during the 2024 three- and nine-month periods primarily reflected higher amounts accrued for performance-related incentive plans due to the improvement in the related performance metrics. The decrease in professional fees for the 2024 three- and nine-month periods primarily reflected a decrease in consulting and temporary personnel fees. The increase in operating expenses for the 2024 nine-month period also reflected an increase in certain software and equipment costs as compared to the same period of 2023. 
 Core domestic operating subsidiaries within our Specialty P C segment and our Workers' Compensation Insurance segment are charged a management fee by the Corporate segment for services provided to these subsidiaries. The management fee is based on the extent to which services are provided to the subsidiary and the amount of premium written by the subsidiary. Under the arrangement, the expenses associated with such services are reported as expenses of the Corporate segment, and the management fees charged are reported as an offset to Corporate operating expenses. While the terms of the arrangement were generally consistent between 2024 and 2023, fluctuations in the amount of premium written by each subsidiary can result in corresponding variations in the management fee charged to each subsidiary during a particular period.

 Interest Expense 
 Interest expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was comprised as follows: 
 Three Months Ended September 30 Nine Months Ended September 30 in thousands) 2024 2023 Change 2024 2023 Change Senior Notes due 2023 3,357 (3,357) nm 10,071 (10,071) nm Contribution Certificates (including accretion) (1)

 2,655 247 2,408 974.9 7,919 755 7,164 948.9 Term Loan (including fees and amortization) 2,465 2,465 nm 7,377 7,377 nm (Gain)/loss on cash flow hedges reclassified from AOCI (1,352) (1,352) nm (4,041) (4,041) nm Interest expense 5,698 5,514 184 3.3 17,004 16,478 526 3.2 (1) Includes accretion of approximately 0.4 million and 1.4 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to 0.5 million and 1.4 million during the same respective periods of 2023, which is recorded as an increase to interest expense as a result of the difference between the recorded acquisition date fair value and the principal balance of the Contribution Certificates associated with our acquisition of NORCAL. 
 
 Interest expense increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same respective periods of 2023 due to a higher effective interest rate on our Revolving Credit Agreement and Term Loan as compared to the effective interest rate of our Senior Notes that matured in November 2023, largely offset by the change in the fair value of our Interest Rate Swaps. The Interest Rate Swaps are designated as highly effective cash flow hedges to manage our exposure to interest rate risk due to variability in the base rates on the borrowings under both the Revolving Credit Agreement and Term Loan. Interest expense on our Revolving Credit Agreement for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily reflected unused commitment fees as there were no outstanding borrowings during either period. See further discussion on our outstanding debt in Note 8 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and additional information regarding our Interest Rate Swaps is provided in Note 9 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 
 Taxes 
 Tax expense allocated to our Corporate segment includes U.S. and U.K. tax expense including U.S. tax expense incurred from our corporate membership in Lloyd's of London, if any. The SPCs at Inova Re, one of our Cayman Islands reinsurance subsidiaries, have each made a 953(d) election under the U.S. Internal Revenue Code and are subject to U.S. federal income tax; therefore, tax expense allocated to our Corporate segment also includes tax expense incurred from any SPC at Inova Re in which we have a participation interest of 80 or greater as those SPCs are required to be included in our consolidated tax return. Consolidated tax expense (benefit) reflects the tax expense (benefit) of both segments and the tax impact of items excluded from segment reporting, as shown in the table below: 
 Three Months Ended September 30 Nine Months Ended September 30 (In thousands) 2024 2023 2024 2023 Corporate segment income tax expense (benefit) 
 4,657 (4,655) 7,837 (3,901) Income tax expense (benefit) - transaction-related costs (67) Consolidated income tax expense (benefit) 
 4,657 (4,655) 7,770 (3,901) Represents the income tax benefit associated with actuarial consulting fees paid during the second quarter of 2024 in relation to the final determination of contingent consideration associated with the NORCAL acquisition. These costs are not included in a segment as we do not consider these costs in assessing the financial performance of any of our operating or reportable segments. See Note 13 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for a reconciliation of our segment results to our consolidated results. 
 
 Listed below are the primary factors affecting our consolidated effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The comparability of each factor's impact on our effective tax rate is affected by the consolidated pre-tax income recognized during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the consolidated pre-tax loss recognized during the same respective periods of 2023. Factors that have the same directional impact on income tax expense in each period have an opposite impact on our effective tax rate due to the effective tax rate being calculated based upon a pre-tax income during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 versus the pre-tax loss during the same respective periods of 2023. Furthermore, the comparability of our effective tax rates is impacted by our use of the estimated 
 77 

Table of Contents 

 annual effective tax rate method for the 2024 three- and nine-month periods versus our use of the discrete effective tax rate method for the 2023 three- and nine-month periods. See further discussion on these methods utilized to compute interim taxes in the Critical Accounting Estimates section under the heading "Estimation of Taxes" and in Note 4 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. These factors include the following:

 (2) Represents the tax impact of a decrease in the contingent consideration liability issued in connection with the NORCAL acquisition of 6.5 million and the reversal of a nominal amount of associated contingent investment banker fees accrued during purchase accounting for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to a decrease in the contingent consideration liability of 1.5 million and 5.5 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, all of which is non-taxable. See further discussion on the contingent consideration in Notes 2 and 7 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 (3) Represents the tax impact of the impairment of non-deductible goodwill in relation to the Workers' Compensation Insurance reporting unit during the third quarter of 2023. See further discussion on the impairment charge in Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in ProAssurance's December 31, 2023 report on Form 10-K. 
 Our effective tax rate for the 2024 nine-month period of 17.5 , as shown in the table above, approximates our overall projected annual effected tax rate of 17.5 as of September 30, 2024 given discrete items had a minimal impact on the effective tax rate. When we utilize the estimated annual effective tax rate method, certain items are treated as discrete items and are reflected in the effective tax rate in the period in which they are included in net income (loss). 
 
 ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. 
 We believe that we are principally exposed to two types of market risk: interest rate risk and credit risk. We have limited exposure to foreign currency risk as we issue few insurance contracts denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar and we have few monetary or non-monetary assets or obligations denominated in foreign currencies. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 Investments 
 Our fixed maturities portfolio is exposed to interest rate risk. Fluctuations in interest rates have a direct impact on the market valuation of these securities. As interest rates rise, market values of fixed income portfolios fall and vice versa. Certain of the securities are held in an unrealized loss position; we do not intend to sell and believe we will not be required to sell any 
 78 

Table of Contents 

 debt security held in an unrealized loss position before its anticipated recovery. If recovery is not anticipated, we will record an impairment loss through earnings either by establishing a credit allowance or by directly reducing the security's amortized cost basis if there is an intent to sell. 
 The following tables summarize estimated changes in the fair value of our available-for-sale fixed maturity securities for specific hypothetical changes in interest rates by asset class at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. There are principally two factors that determine interest rates on a given security: changes in the level of yield curves and credit spreads. As different asset classes can be affected in different ways by movements in those two factors, we have separated our portfolio by asset class in the following tables.

 Computations of prospective effects of hypothetical interest rate changes are based on numerous assumptions, including the maintenance of the existing level and composition of fixed income security assets, and should not be relied on as indicative of future results. 
 Certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the computation of the fair value of fixed rate instruments. Actual values may differ from the projections presented should market conditions vary from assumptions used in the calculation of the fair value of individual securities, including non-parallel shifts in the term structure of interest rates and changing individual issuer credit spreads. 
 At September 30, 2024, our fixed maturities portfolio includes fixed maturities classified as trading securities which do not have a significant amount of exposure to market interest rates or credit spreads. 
 Our cash and short-term investments at September 30, 2024 were carried at fair value which approximates their cost basis due to their short-term nature. Our cash and short-term investments lack significant interest rate sensitivity due to their short duration. 
 Debt 
 We are exposed to interest rate risk due to variability in the base rate on borrowings under our Revolving Credit Agreement and Term Loan. Borrowings under our Revolving Credit Agreement and Term Loan accrue interest at a selected SOFR base rate, adjusted by a margin. To manage our exposure to interest rate risk on any borrowings under these agreements, we entered into two Interest Rate Swaps which effectively fix the base rate on borrowings under the Revolving Credit Agreement and Term Loan to 3.187 and 3.207 , respectively. See further information regarding the Interest Rate Swaps in Note 9 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. As of September 30, 2024, the Revolving Credit Agreement and Term Loan have 125 million and 122 million in outstanding borrowings, respectively. Additional information regarding our debt is provided in Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in our December 31, 2023 report on Form 10-K. 
 Defined Benefit Pension Plan 
 We are exposed to certain economic risks related to the costs of our defined benefit pension plan, including changes in discount rates for high quality corporate bonds and changes in the expected return on plan assets. 
 Credit Risk 
 We have exposure to credit risk primarily as a holder of fixed income securities. We control this exposure by emphasizing investment grade credit quality in the fixed income securities we purchase. 
 As of September 30, 2024, 93 of our fixed maturity securities were rated investment grade as determined by NRSROs, such as Fitch, Moody s and Standard Poor s. We believe that this concentration in investment grade securities reduces our exposure to credit risk on our fixed income investments to an acceptable level. However, investment grade securities, in spite of their rating, can rapidly deteriorate and result in significant losses. Ratings published by the NRSROs are one of the tools used to evaluate the creditworthiness of our securities. The ratings reflect the subjective opinion of the rating agencies as to the creditworthiness of the securities; therefore, we may be subject to additional credit exposure should the ratings prove to be unreliable. 
 We also have exposure to credit risk related to our premiums receivable and receivables from reinsurers; however, to-date we have not experienced any significant amount of credit losses. At September 30, 2024, our premiums receivable was approximately 265 million, net of an allowance for expected credit losses of approximately 8 million. See Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in our December 31, 2023 report on Form 10-K for further information on our allowance for expected credit losses related to our premiums receivable. Our receivables from reinsurers (with regard to both paid and unpaid losses) approximated 468 million at September 30, 2024 and 467 million at December 31, 2023. We monitor the credit risk associated with our reinsurers using publicly available financial and rating agency data. We have not historically experienced material credit losses due to the financial condition of a reinsurer, and as of September 30, 2024 our expected credit losses associated with our receivables from reinsurers were nominal in amount.

 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. 
 The principal executive officer and principal financial officer of the Company participated in management s evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in SEC Rule 13a-15(e)) as of September 30, 2024. ProAssurance s disclosure controls and procedures are designed to reasonably assure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding disclosure and is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms. Based on that evaluation, the principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There have been no significant changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, those controls during the quarter.
