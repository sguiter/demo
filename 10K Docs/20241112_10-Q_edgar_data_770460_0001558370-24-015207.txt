from the amortized cost basis of held to maturity debt securities. The allowance for credit losses on held to maturity debt securities is estimated on a collective or pool basis when similar risk characteristics exist; held to maturity debt securities that share similar risk characteristics are collectively assessed for credit losses. A separate contra valuation account is available to absorb losses on securities. The allowance for credit loss is limited to the amount by which the fair value is less than the amortized cost basis. The Bank evaluates credit impairment on available for sale debt securities at an individual security level. This evaluation is done for securities whose fair value is below amortized cost with a more than inconsequential risk of default and where the Bank has assessed the decline in fair value is significant enough to suggest a credit event occurred. Credit events are generally assessed based on adverse conditions specifically related to the security, an industry, or geographic area, changes in the financial condition of the issuer of the security, or in the case of an asset-backed debt security, changes in the financial condition of the underlying loan obligors. The allowance for credit losses for such securities is measured using a discounted cash flow methodology, through which management compares the present value of expected cash flows with the amortized cost basis of the security. The allowance for credit loss is limited to the amount by which the fair value is less than the amortized cost basis. If the Bank intends to sell the debt security, or more likely than not will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, the security is charged down to fair value against the allowance for credit losses, with any incremental impairment reported in earnings. The Bank reassesses the credit losses at each reporting period and records subsequent changes in the allowance for credit losses on loans, unfunded commitments and securities with a corresponding adjustment recorded in the provision for credit loss expense. and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, for interest on deposits and borrowings.

For the securities that do not have ratings, management assigned a rating based on ratings for similar municipalities. This evaluation is done for securities whose fair value is below amortized cost with a more than inconsequential risk of default and where the Company has assessed the decline in fair value is significant enough to suggest a credit event occurred. Credit events are generally assessed based on adverse conditions specifically related to the security, an industry, geographic area, changes in the financial condition of the issuer of the security, or in the case of an asset-backed debt security, changes in the financial condition of the underlying loan obligors. Management utilized a model provided by a third-party vendor to calculate the potential reserve required on the specific securities. The approach utilizes many inputs including enhanced and underlying ratings, maturity, issuer type/subtype, NAICS code, origination date, refunding status as well as state and region. At adoption of CECL, management determined there was a reserve required for the allowance for credit losses on held-to-maturity securities. At the end of the year an updated analysis was performed, and management determined a reduction of the provision for credit losses on held to maturity securities was appropriate as of December 31, 2023. additional provision or reduction was required as of September 30, 2024.

A score of 1 5 is assigned to the loan based on factors including repayment ability, trends in net worth and/or financial condition of the borrower and guarantors, employment stability, management ability, loan to value fluctuations, the type and structure of the loan, conformity of the loan to bank policy and payment performance. Based on the total score, a loan grade of A, B, C, S, D, E or F is applied. A grade of A will generally be applied to loans for customers that are well known to the Company and that have excellent sources of repayment. A grade of B will generally be applied to loans for customers that have excellent sources of repayment which have no identifiable risk of collection. A grade of C will generally be applied to loans for customers that have adequate sources of repayment which have little identifiable risk of collection. A grade of S will generally be applied to loans for customers who meet the criteria for a grade of C but also warrant additional monitoring by placement on the watch list. A grade of D will generally be applied to loans for customers that are inadequately protected by current sound net worth, paying capacity of the borrower, or pledged collateral. Loans with a grade of D have unsatisfactory characteristics such as cash flow deficiencies, bankruptcy filing by the borrower or dependence on the sale of collateral for the primary source of repayment, causing more than acceptable levels of risk. Loans 60 to 89 days past due receive a grade of D. A grade of E will generally be applied to loans for customers with weaknesses inherent in the D classification and in which collection or liquidation in full is questionable. In addition, on a monthly basis the Company determines which loans are 90 days or more past due and assigns a grade of E to them.

The following table represents the accrued interest receivables written off by reversing interest income during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and the year ended December 31, 2023 (in thousands): Total loans The Company designates individually evaluated loans on nonaccrual status as collateral-dependent loans, as well as other loans that management of the Company designates as having higher risk. Collateral-dependent loans are loans for which the repayment is expected to be provided substantially through the operation or sale of the collateral and the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty. These loans do not share common risk characteristics and are not included within the collectively evaluated loans for determining the allowance for credit losses. Under CECL, for collateral-dependent loans, the Company has adopted the practical expedient to measure the allowance for credit losses based on the fair value of collateral. The allowance for credit losses is calculated on an individual loan basis based on the shortfall between the fair value of the loan s collateral, which is adjusted for liquidation costs/discounts, and amortized cost. If the fair value of the collateral exceeds the amortized cost, no allowance is required. The following table presents an analysis of collateral-dependent loans of the Company as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 (in thousands): Total loans The following tables further disaggregates nonaccrual disclosures by amortized cost by class and vintage for term loans and by revolving and revolving converted to amortizing as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 (in thousands).

These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of factors and uncertainties which could cause the Company s actual results and experience to differ from the anticipated results and expectations expressed in such forward-looking statements. Such factors and uncertainties include, but are not limited to: changes in interest rates and market prices, changes in local economic and business conditions, increased competition for deposits and loans, changes in the availability of funds resulting from reduced liquidity, changes in statutes, government regulations or regulatory policies or practices in general and specifically as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and acts of terrorism, weather or other events beyond the Company s control. New Accounting Pronouncements The Financial Accounting Standards Board issued several accounting standards updates during the first nine months of 2024. Further disclosure is included in Note 1. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America GAAP requires Management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The Company evaluates these estimates and assumptions on an on-going basis using historical experience and other factors, including the current economic environment. We adjust such estimates and assumptions when facts and circumstances dictate. Certain critical accounting policies affect the more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. Investments Investments which are classified as available for sale are stated at fair value. The determination of the fair value of securities may require Management to develop estimates and assumptions regarding the amount and timing of cash flows. On January 1, 2023 the Company adopted the Accounting Standards Codification ASC 326, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses , more commonly referred to as CECL which requires an assessment of the Company s available for sale and held to maturity debt securities for expected credit losses. 

 30 

Allowance for credit losses on loans and leases and unfunded lending commitments On January 1, 2023 the Company adopted Accounting Standards Codification ASC 326, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses , more commonly referred to as CECL. Under CECL, the allowance for credit losses (ACL) is a valuation account, measured as the difference between the Company s amortized cost basis and the net amount expected to be collected on the financial assets (i.e., lifetime credit losses). The CECL methodology described in FASB Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-13, Financial Instruments Credit Losses (Topic 326), applies to financial assets measured at amortized cost, and off-balance-sheet credit exposures (collectively, financial assets). In general, the Company uses a broad range of data to estimate expected credit losses under CECL, including information about past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts relevant to assessing the collectability of the cash flows of financial assets. CECL requires the Bank to measure expected credit losses on financial assets carried at amortized cost on a collective or pool basis when similar risk characteristics exist. The Bank has determined that Call Report categories will be utilized, and Management will maintain the option to further segment the portfolio if we deem it beneficial to the analysis. Estimating an appropriate ACL involves a high degree of Management judgment. As such, it is Management s responsibility to record the Bank s best estimate of expected credit losses and provide it to the Board of Directors. The analysis is prepared and reported to the Board of Directors on a quarterly basis. The option and decision to prepare the analysis more frequently will remain with Management. The Company s most critical accounting policy relates to its allowance for credit losses on loans and leases and unfunded lending commitments, which reflects the estimated losses resulting from the inability of its borrowers to make loan payments. The allowance for credit losses on loans and leases and unfunded lending commitments is established and maintained at an amount sufficient to absorb losses on loans and leases held for investment. Credit losses arise not only from credit risk, but also from other risks inherent in the lending process including, but not limited to, collateral risk, operation risk, concentration risk and economic risk. As such, all related risks of lending are considered when assessing the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses on loans and leases and unfunded commitments. Management believes that the allowance for credit losses on loans and unfunded lending commitments is adequate and appropriate for all periods presented in these financial statements. All credit relationships with an outstanding balance of 100,000 or greater that are included in Management s loan watch list are individually reviewed for credit losses. Other Real Estate Other real estate ORE includes real estate acquired through foreclosure or repossession. Each other real estate property is carried at fair value, less estimated costs to sell. Fair value is principally based on appraisals or other valuations performed by third-party valuation specialists. If Management determines that the fair value of a property has decreased subsequent to foreclosure, the Company records a write down which is included in non-interest expense. Employee Benefit Plans Employee benefit plan liabilities and pension costs are determined utilizing actuarially determined present value calculations. The valuation of the benefit obligation and net periodic expense is considered critical, as it requires Management and its actuaries to make estimates regarding the amount and timing of expected cash outflows including assumptions about mortality, expected service periods and the rate of compensation increases. 

 31 

Income Taxes The Company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for deferred income taxes and provides deferred income taxes for all significant income tax temporary differences. As part of the process of preparing the consolidated financial statements, the Company is required to estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates. This process involves estimating the actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items, such as the provision for credit losses, for tax and financial reporting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities that are included in the consolidated statement of condition. The Company must also assess the likelihood that the deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income, and, to the extent Management believes that recovery is not likely, the Company must establish a valuation allowance. Significant Management judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes, the deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against the net deferred tax assets. To the extent the Company establishes a valuation allowance or adjusts this allowance in a period, the Company must include an expense or a benefit within the tax provisions in the consolidated statement of income. GAAP Reconciliation and Explanation This Form 10-Q contains non-GAAP financial measures determined by methods other than in accordance with GAAP. Such non-GAAP financial measures include taxable equivalent interest income and taxable equivalent net interest income. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures because it believes they are useful for evaluating our operations and performance over periods of time, as well as in managing and evaluating our business and in discussions about our operations and performance. Management believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide users of our financial information with a meaningful measure for assessing our financial results, as well as comparison to financial results for prior periods. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as a substitute for operating results determined in accordance with GAAP and may not be comparable to other similarly titled financial measures used by other companies. A reconciliation of these operating performance measures to GAAP performance measures for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 is included in the table below (in thousands). RECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP PERFORMANCE MEASURES 

Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Interest income reconciliation: Interest income - taxable equivalent 7,900 7,914 25,666 25,158 Taxable equivalent adjustment (70) (75) (212) (232) Interest income (GAAP) 7,830 7,839 25,454 24,926 Net interest income reconciliation: Net interest income - taxable equivalent 5,349 6,424 18,085 20,833 Taxable equivalent adjustment (70) (75) (210) (232) Net interest income (GAAP) 5,279 6,349 17,875 20,601 OVERVIEW The Company is a community bank serving the financial and trust needs of its customers in our trade area, which is defined as those portions of Mississippi, Louisiana and Alabama which are within a fifty mile radius of the Waveland, Wiggins and Gautier branches, the bank subsidiary s three most outlying locations. Maintaining a strong core deposit base and providing commercial and real estate lending in our trade area are the traditional focuses of the Company. Growth has largely been achieved through de novo branching activity, and it is expected that these strategies will continue to be emphasized in the future.

The Company reported net income of 15,431,000 for the third quarter of 2024 compared with net income of 1,910,000 for the third quarter of 2023. The Company reported net income of 20,175,000 for the first nine months of 2024 compared with net income of 7,443,000 for the first nine months of 2023. Results in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 included a discrete item of 15,194,000 recorded as a tax benefit for the reversal of the Company s valuation allowance on federal and state deferred tax assets. Pre-tax income for the third quarter of 2024 decreased 904,000 to 1,334,000 as compared with 2,238,000 for the third quarter of 2023. Total interest income decreased by 9,000 to 7,830,000 for the third quarter of 2024 as compared with 7,839,000 for the third quarter of 2023 due to lower interest income on securities and overnight fed funds caused by a decrease in balances and yields. Total interest expense increased by 1,061,000 to 2,551,000 for the third quarter of 2024 as compared with 1,490,000 for the third quarter of 2023 due to higher interest rates paid on deposit accounts and borrowings. Pre-tax income for the first nine months of 2024 decreased 2,549,000 to 6,480,000 as compared with 9,029,000 for the first nine months of 2023. Total interest income increased by 528,000 to 25,454,000 for the first nine months of 2024 as compared with 24,926,000 for the first nine months of 2023 due to higher interest and fees on loans. Total interest expense increased by 3,254,000 to 7,579,000 for the first nine months of 2024 as compared with 4,325,000 for the first nine months of 2023 due to higher interest rates paid on deposit accounts and borrowings. Managing the net interest margin is a key component of the Company s earnings strategy. During 2022, the Federal Reserve increased rates by 425 basis points and again in 2023 increased rates by 100 basis points in an effort to slow inflation. The Federal Reserve decreased rates by 50 basis points so far in 2024. Monitoring asset quality, estimating potential losses in our loan portfolio, unfunded lending commitments and held to maturity debt securities and addressing non-performing loans continue to be a major focus of the Company. A reduction of the provision for the allowance for credit losses of (48,000) was recorded in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared with a provision of 22,000 and (275,000) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. On January 1, 2023, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Codification ASC 326, Financial Instruments Credit Losses, more commonly referred to as CECL, on a modified retrospective basis. Upon adoption, the Company recognized an after-tax cumulative effect reduction to retained earnings totaling 81,000, this adjustment included adjustments to the allowance for credit losses on loans, unfunded lending commitments and held to maturity debt securities. The Company has worked diligently to address and reduce its non-performing assets. The Company s nonaccrual loans totaled 427,000 and 213,000 at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Most of these loans are collateral-dependent, and the Company has rigorously evaluated the value of its collateral to determine potential losses. Non-interest income increased 5,000 for the third quarter of 2024 as compared with 2023 results. Results for the third quarter of 2024 included higher miscellaneous or other income of 14,000 along with higher trust department income and fees of 15,000. Non-interest income decreased 1,000 for the first three quarters of 2024 as compared with 2023 results. Results for the first three quarters of 2024 included lower service charge income of 77,000 which was mostly offset by higher miscellaneous or other income of 27,000, trust income of 26,000 along with a gain on the sale of bank property of 46,000. Non-interest expenses decreased 91,000 for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, as compared with 2023 results. This net decrease for the third quarter of 2024 was primarily the result of a decrease in salary and employee benefits of 121,000 which was the result of an increase in the discount rate which decreased the liability on deferred compensation expense. Non-interest expenses decreased 405,000 for the three quarters ended September 30, 2024, as compared with 2023 results. This net decrease for the three quarters ended September 30, 2024, was primarily the result of lower salary expenses of 766,000 due to an increase in the discount rate which decreased deferred compensation expense somewhat offset by higher ATM expenses of 234,000 and net occupancy expense of 112,000 and maintenance expense of 197,000. Total assets at September 30, 2024 increased 16,414,000 as compared with December 31, 2023. Total deposits decreased 22,404,000. This decrease was mostly caused by the loss of several large public fund deposits in 2024 following competitive bid processes held in 2023 whereby the public fund deposit accounts were awarded to other local banks. The Company did not experience any additional losses of large public fund deposit accounts for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The decrease in deposits was offset by maturing securities along with borrowings from the Bank Term Funding Program. Borrowings increased 11,500,000 as compared with December 31, 2023.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Net Interest Income Net interest income, the amount by which interest income on loans, investments and other interest- earning assets exceeds interest expense on deposits and other borrowed funds, is the single largest component of the Company s income. Management s objective is to provide the largest possible amount of income while balancing interest rate, credit, liquidity and capital risk. Changes in the volume and mix of interest earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities combined with changes in market rates of interest directly affect net interest income. Quarter Ended September 30, 2024 as Compared with Quarter Ended September 30, 2023 The Company s average interest-earning assets decreased approximately 18,616,000, or 2.41 , from approximately 771,177,000 for the third quarter of 2023 to approximately 752,561,000 for the third quarter of 2024. The Company s average balance sheet decreased primarily as average investments decreased approximately 7,897,000 along with a decrease in average balances due from financial institutions of approximately 18,825,000, offset slightly with an increase in average loans of approximately 7,267,000 for the third quarter of 2024 as compared with the third quarter of 2023. Average loans increased as new loans exceeded principal payments, maturities, and charge-offs on existing loans. Decreases in average deposits resulted in the decrease in balances due from financial institutions and investments in securities which resulted in an increase in average borrowings. The average yield on interest-earning assets increased from 4.10 for the third quarter of 2023 to 4.19 for the third quarter of 2024. This increase is due to an increase in interest rates on overnight fed funds, and loans in 2024. Average interest-bearing liabilities decreased approximately 8,692,000 or 1.56 , from approximately 556,243,000 for the third quarter of 2023 to approximately 547,551,000 for the third quarter of 2024. Average savings and interest bearing DDA deposits decreased approximately 53,818,000 while time deposits decreased approximately 5,858,000. This decrease was mostly caused by the loss of several large public fund deposits in 2024 following competitive bid processes held in 2023 whereby the public fund deposit accounts were awarded to other local banks along with the allocation of public fund tax deposits that increase as taxes are collected and slowly allocate out of the deposit accounts through the end of each year. Although average deposits decreased the Company evaluates on an ongoing and continuous basis various moderate to severe economic scenarios and does not anticipate a liquidity issue. The average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities for the third quarter of 2023 was 1.07 as compared with 1.86 for the third quarter of 2024. The Federal Reserve has increased rates significantly throughout 2022 and 2023 which has caused the bank in 2023 and 2024 to experience a rising cost of funds to stay competitive with other local banks the rising costs should ease some as rates start to decrease. The Company s net interest margin on a tax-equivalent basis, which is net interest income as a percentage of average earning assets, was 3.32 for the third quarter of 2023 as compared with 2.84 for the third quarter of 2024. Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 as Compared with Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 The Company s average interest-earning assets decreased approximately 36,168,000, or 4.31 , from approximately 839,238,000 for the first three quarters of 2023 to approximately 803,070,000 for the first three quarters of 2024. The Company s average balance sheet decreased primarily as average investments decreased approximately 32,541,000 along with a decrease in average balances due from financial institutions of approximately 6,822,000, slightly offset with an increase in average loans of approximately 2,753,000 for the first three quarters of 2024 as compared with the first three quarters of 2023. Average loans increased as new loans exceeded principal payments, maturities, and charge-offs on existing loans. Decreases in average deposits resulted in the decrease in balances due from financial institutions and investments in securities which resulted in an increase in average borrowings. The average yield on earning assets increased from 3.99 for the first three quarters of 2023 to 4.25 for the first three quarters of 2024. This increase is due to an increase in interest rates on overnight fed funds, and loans in 2024. 

 34 

Average interest-bearing liabilities decreased approximately 27,323,000, or 4.31 , from approximately 632,091,000 for the first three quarters of 2023 to approximately 604,768,000 for the first three quarters of 2024. Average savings and interest bearing DDA balances decreased approximately 60,720,000 while average time deposits decreased approximately 8,750,000. This decrease was mostly caused by the loss of several large public fund deposits in 2024 following competitive bid processes held in 2023 whereby the public fund deposit accounts were awarded to other local banks along with the allocation of public fund tax deposits that increase as taxes are collected and slowly allocate out of the deposit accounts through the end of each year. Although average deposits decreased the Company evaluates on an ongoing and continuous basis various moderate to severe economic scenarios and does not anticipate a liquidity issue. The average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities for the first three quarters of 2023 was 0.91 compared with 1.67 for the first three quarters of 2024. The Federal Reserve has increased rates significantly throughout 2022 and 2023 which has caused the bank in 2023 and 2024 to experience a rising cost of funds to stay competitive with other local banks the rising costs should ease some as rates start to decrease. The Company s net interest margin on a tax-equivalent basis, which is net interest income as a percentage of average earning assets, was 3.30 for the first three quarters of 2023 as compared with 3.00 for the first three quarters of 2024. The tables on the following pages analyze the changes in tax-equivalent net interest income for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

Provision for Credit Losses In the normal course of business, the Company assumes risk in extending credit to its customers. This credit risk is managed through compliance with the loan policy, which is approved by the Board of Directors. The policy establishes guidelines relating to underwriting standards, including but not limited to financial analysis, collateral valuation, lending limits, pricing considerations and loan grading. The Company s Loan Review and Special Assets Departments play key roles in monitoring the loan portfolio and managing problem loans. New loans and, on a periodic basis, existing loans are reviewed to evaluate compliance with the loan policy. Loan delinquencies and deposit overdrafts are closely monitored in order to identify developing problems as early as possible. Lenders experienced in workout scenarios consult with loan officers and customers to address non-performing loans. A watch list of credits which pose a potential loss to the Company is prepared based on the loan grading system. This list forms the foundation of the Company s allowance for credit loss on loans computation. Management relies on its guidelines and existing methodology to monitor the performance of its loan portfolio and identify and estimate potential losses based on the best available information. The potential effect of declines in real estate values and actual losses incurred by the Company were key factors in our analysis. Much of the Company s loan portfolio is secured by real estate requiring careful consideration of real estate changes in value to properly monitor risk. The Company has adopted the CECL (Current Expected Credit Losses) methodology for estimating allowances for credit losses effective January 1, 2023. Under CECL, the allowance for credit losses (ACL) is a valuation account, measured as the difference between the Bank s amortized cost basis and the net amount expected to be collected on the financial assets (i.e., lifetime credit losses). The CECL methodology described in FASB Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-13, Financial Instruments Credit Losses (Topic 326), applies to financial assets measured at amortized cost, and off-balance-sheet credit exposures (collectively, financial assets) including: financing receivables such as loans held for investment, held to maturity debt securities, off-balance-sheet credit exposures (unfunded commitments) including off-balance sheet loan commitments; standby letters of credit; and other similar instruments. In general, the Bank uses a broad range of data to estimate expected credit losses under CECL, including information about past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts relevant to assessing the collectability of the cash flows of financial assets. The following represents an overview of key factors regarding CECL: CECL requires the Bank to measure expected credit losses on financial assets carried at amortized cost on a collective or pool basis when similar risk characteristics exist. The Bank has determined that Call Report categories will be utilized, and Management will maintain the option to further segment the portfolio if we deem it beneficial to the analysis. As stated above, CECL also applies to held to maturity debt securities since they are carried at amortized cost and are within the scope of the standard. Therefore, it is the responsibility of management to establish any required allowances for credit losses on the Bank s held to maturity debt securities as of the date the Bank adopts CECL and to maintain such allowances thereafter. Because CECL requires the Bank to measure expected credit losses on a collective or pool basis when similar risk characteristics exist, held to maturity debt securities that share similar risk characteristics are collectively assessed for credit losses. Estimating an appropriate ACL involves a high degree of management judgment. As such, it is Management s responsibility to record the Bank s best estimate of expected credit losses and provide it to the Board of Directors. The analysis is prepared and reported to the Board of Directors on a quarterly basis. The option and decision to prepare the analysis more frequently will remain with management. Estimation Methods for Expected Credit Losses-Accounting Standards Codification ASC 326, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses, does not require the use of a specific loss estimation method for purposes of determining ACLs. Various methods may be used to estimate the expected collectability of financial assets, with those methods generally applied consistently overtime. The same loss estimation method does not need to be applied to all financial assets. Loss-rate methods can involve a variety of approaches, and Management incorporates the methods below: 

 38 

Open Pool or Snapshot Method The starting point for the calculation consists of assets that are outstanding at the end of a given time frame and are made up of assets that were originated in various years. Additional assets may be added to pools of loans under an open pool method. Weighted Average Remaining Maturity (WARM) Method A loss-rate method that estimates expected credit losses over the remaining life of the financial assets and uses a weighted average of the assets contractual terms to estimate the pool s remaining contractual term. The WARM method uses average annual net charge-off rates and the amortization adjusted remaining life considering prepayments plus qualitative adjustments to estimate the ACLs. Qualitative Factor Adjustments The estimation of ACLs is to reflect consideration of all significant factors relevant to the expected collectability of the Bank s financial assets as of the reporting date. Management begins their expected credit loss estimation process by determining the Bank s historical loss information. Management is to consider the need to qualitatively adjust expected credit loss estimates for information not already captured in the loss estimation process. These qualitative factor adjustments may increase or decrease management s estimate of expected credit losses. Historical loss experience generally provides a quantitative starting point for Management s estimate of expected credit losses. Consistent with FASB ASU Topic 326, Management must consider relevant qualitative factors that may cause the CECL estimate of the financial asset portfolio as of the evaluation date to differ from the historical loss experience. Management is to consider the qualitative factors that are relevant to the Bank as of the reporting date, which may include but are not limited to the: 1. Nature and volume of the Bank s financial assets. 2. Existence, growth, and effect of any concentrations of credit. 3. Volume and severity of past due financial assets, the volume of nonaccrual assets, and the volume and severity of adversely classified or graded assets. Adversely classified or graded loans are loans rated substandard (or its equivalent) or worse under the institution s loan classification system. 4. Value of the underlying collateral for loans that are not collateral dependent. 5. Bank s lending policies and procedures, including changes in underwriting standards and practices for collections, write-offs, and recoveries. 6. Quality of the Bank s credit review function. 7. Experience, ability, and depth of the Bank s lending, investment, collection, and other relevant management and staff. 8. Effect of other external factors such as the regulatory, legal, and technological environments, competition, and events such as natural disasters. 9. Actual and expected changes in international, national, regional, and local economic and business conditions and developments in which the institution operates that affect the collectability of financial assets. Changes in economic and business conditions and developments included in qualitative factor adjustments are limited to those that affect the collectability of the Bank s financial assets and are relevant to the Bank s financial asset portfolios. The Bank s on-going, systematic evaluation resulted in the Bank recording a negative provision of (40,000) along with a negative provision on unfunded commitments of (8,000) and a provision for the allowance for credit losses on unfunded commitments of 22,000 for the third quarter of 2024 and 2023, respectively. The Bank recorded a negative provision for the allowance for credit losses on loans and leases of (100,000) and a provision on unfunded commitments of 52,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. No provision was needed for the allowance for credit losses on held to 

 39 

maturity securities for the first nine months ended September 30, 2024. The Bank recorded a negative provision of (280,000) on loans and leases and a provision of 5,000 on unfunded commitments for the first nine months ended September 30, 2023. The Bank s analysis includes evaluating the current values of collateral securing all nonaccrual loans. Nonaccrual loans totaled 427,000 and 213,000 with 0 and 39,500 in specific reserves on these loans as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The specific reserves allocated to nonaccrual loans are relatively low as collateral values appear sufficient to cover credit losses, or the loan balances have been charged down to their realizable value. The allowance for credit losses on loans and leases as a percentage of loans was 1.29 and 1.35 at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The Company believes that its allowance for credit losses on loans and leases is appropriate as of September 30, 2024. The allowance for credit losses on loans and leases is an estimate, and as such, events may occur in the future which may affect its accuracy. The Company anticipates that it is possible that additional information will be gathered in future quarters on loan performance, which may require an adjustment to the allowance for credit losses on loans and leases. Management will continue to closely monitor its portfolio and take such action as it deems appropriate to accurately report its financial condition and results of operations. Non-interest income Quarter Ended September 30, 2024 as Compared with Quarter Ended September 30, 2023 Non-interest income increased 5,000 for the third quarter of 2024 as compared with the third quarter of 2023. Results for the third quarter of 2024 included higher miscellaneous or other income of 14,000 along with higher trust department income and fees of 15,000 mostly offset by lower service charge income of 1,000 which can fluctuate in the normal course of business. Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 as Compared with Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 Non-interest income decreased 1,000 for the first three quarters of 2024 as compared with the first three quarters of 2023. Results for the first three quarters of 2024 included lower service charge income of 77,000 which was mostly offset by higher miscellaneous or other income of 27,000, trust income of 26,000 along with a gain on the sale of bank property of 46,000, both service charge income and trust income can fluctuate in the normal course of business. Non-interest expense Quarter Ended September 30, 2024 as Compared with Quarter Ended September 30, 2023 Total non-interest expense decreased 91,000 for the third quarter of 2024 as compared with the third quarter of 2023. In 2024, salary and employee benefits decreased by 121,000 due to the increase in the discount rate which decreased the liabilities associated with deferred compensation expense. Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 as Compared with Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 Total non-interest expense decreased 405,000 for the first three quarters of 2024 as compared with the first three quarters of 2023. In 2024, salary and employee benefits decreased by 766,000 due to a decrease in the liabilities associated with deferred compensation expense. This decrease was somewhat offset by an increase in ATM expense of 234,000 and net occupancy expense which increased 112,000 along with an increase in maintenance expense of 197,000. Income Taxes During the third quarter of 2024, the Company determined that there was sufficient evidence to support (at the more likely than not threshold) that the Company will have sufficient future sources of taxable income to remove substantially all of 

 40 

the valuation allowance established as of the beginning of the year and as of September 30, 2024. This change in circumstances resulted in a discrete item of 15,194,000 recognized as a reduction of income tax expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Quarter Ended September 30, 2024 as Compared with Quarter Ended September 30, 2023 The Company has recorded deferred and current income tax expenses in the first, second and third quarters of 2024 and 2023, respectively. Income tax expense decreased 14,425,000 due to a tax (benefit) of 14,097,000 for the third quarter of 2024 as compared with tax expense of 328,000 for the third quarter of 2023. This decrease was due to the release of the Company s tax valuation allowance on federal and state deferred tax assets. Additionally, third quarter 2024 pretax income was 904,000 less than the same period in 2023. Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 as Compared with Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 The Company had a valuation allowance on federal and state deferred tax assets totaling 15,617,000 as of December 31, 2023. In the third quarter of 2024, the Company reassessed the valuation allowance in accordance with applicable accounting guidance and determined it was appropriate to reverse substantially all the valuation allowance which resulted in a one-time discrete reduction to income tax expense of 15,194,000 in the current quarter. Excluding the discrete item, income tax expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, totaled 1,500,000 based upon the expected annual tax rate for 2024 of 23.1 compared to income tax expense of 1,586,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, at an effective rate of 17.6 . The net deferred tax asset recognized on the Company consolidated balance sheet totaled 12,250,000 at September 30, 2024 and 756,000 at December 31, 2023. FINANCIAL CONDITION Cash and due from banks increased 19,459,000 at September 30, 2024, compared with December 31, 2023. This increase was due to a decrease in total securities and an increase in borrowings. Available for sale securities increased 2,401,000 and held to maturity securities decreased 17,276,000, respectively at September 30, 2024 compared with December 31, 2023 as the Company decreased its held to maturity securities and increased its available for sale investment purchases. As securities mature the proceeds are used to pay down borrowings. Gross loans increased 920,000 at September 30, 2024 compared with December 31, 2023, as new loans outpaced principal payments, maturities, and charge-offs on existing loans. Total deposits decreased 22,404,000 at September 30, 2024, compared with December 31, 2023. Typically, significant increases or decreases in total deposits and/or significant fluctuations among the different types of deposits from quarter to quarter are anticipated by Management as customers in the casino industry and county and municipal entities reallocate their resources periodically. Deposits from county and municipal entities increase significantly during the first quarter of each year based on property tax collections and are slowly allocated out of the tax collection accounts over the course of the year. As interest rates have increased and the cost of attracting new deposits and replacing deposit run-off has increased, the Bank experienced a decrease in deposit balances during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. This decrease was mostly caused by the loss of several large public fund deposits during 2023 that ran off in 2024 following competitive bid processes whereby the public fund deposit accounts were awarded to other local banks. The Company did not experience any additional losses of large public fund deposit accounts for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY AND CAPITAL ADEQUACY Strength, security and stability have been the hallmark of the Company since its founding in 1985 and of its bank subsidiary since its founding in 1896. A strong capital foundation is fundamental to the continuing prosperity of the Company and the security of its customers and shareholders. 

 41 

As of December 31, 2023, the most recent notification from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation categorized the Bank as well capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action. During the third quarter of 2023, the community bank leverage ratio (CBLR) framework was elected. The CBLR framework is an optional framework that is designed to reduce burden by removing the requirements for calculating and reporting risk-based capital ratios for qualifying community banking organizations that opt into the framework. The framework provides a simple measure of capital adequacy for qualifying community banking organizations, consistent with section 201 of the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act. Qualifying community banking organizations that elect to use the CBLR framework and that maintain a leverage ratio of greater than 9.00 are considered to have satisfied the risk-based and leverage capital requirements in the generally applicable capital rule. In addition, these institutions are considered to have met the well-capitalized ratio requirements for purposes of section 38 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act. The main components and requirements of the CBLR framework are as follows: As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Bank s community bank leverage ratio was 13.48 and 12.59 , respectively, both of which exceed the CBLR minimum of 9.00 . Management continues to emphasize the importance of maintaining the appropriate capital levels of the Company and has established the goal of being well-capitalized by the banking regulatory authorities. LIQUIDITY Liquidity represents the Company s ability to adequately provide funds to satisfy demands from depositors, borrowers and other commitments by either converting assets to cash or accessing new or existing sources of funds. Management monitors these funds requirements in such a manner as to satisfy these demands and provide the maximum earnings on its earning assets. The Company manages and monitors its liquidity position through a number of methods, including through the computation of liquidity risk targets and the preparation of various analyses of its funding sources and utilization of those sources on a monthly basis. The Company also uses proforma liquidity projections which are updated on a monthly basis in the management of its liquidity needs and also conducts periodic contingency testing on its liquidity plan. Deposits, payments of principal and interest on loans, proceeds from maturities of investment securities and earnings on investment securities are the principal sources of funds for the Company. Borrowings from the FHLB, federal funds sold and federal funds purchased are utilized by the Company to manage its daily liquidity position. The Company has also been approved to participate in the Federal Reserve Bank s Discount Window Primary Credit Program, as well as its Bank Term Funding Program. The Company was able to borrow under the Bank Term Funding Program 30,000,000 at a rate of 4.87 which matures in January 2025. As of September 30, 2024, the Company was able to borrow up to 6,053,000 from the Federal Reserve Bank Discount Window Primary Credit Program. The borrowing limit is based on the amount of collateral pledged, with certain loans from the Bank s portfolio serving as collateral. The Company has 115,402,320 available under a line of credit with the Federal Home Loan Bank of Dallas with 115,402,320 available. The Company has additional contingency funding capacity with various other financial institutions in the amount of 30,500,000. The Company maintains a well-capitalized balance sheet which includes strong capital and liquidity. The Bank provides a full range of banking, financial and trust services in our local markets. The majority of the Bank s deposits are fully FDIC insured and the Company evaluates on an ongoing and continuous basis it s financial health by preparing for various moderate to severe economic scenarios. Determining liquidity adequacy requires an ongoing analysis of the Company s current and expected liquidity position, including historical funding obligations and anticipated funding needs, as well as an understanding of retention prospects for all bank deposits. In particular, consideration is given to public funds and other large depositors for potential runoffs due to expected uses or other withdrawals from bank accounts. 

 42 

The Company also uses other sources of funds, including borrowings from the FHLB. The Company generally anticipates relying on deposits, purchases of federal funds and borrowings from the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta and FHLB for its liquidity needs in 2024. The Board of Directors requires management to implement and administer appropriate internal controls commensurate with Company s risk profile. Management carefully monitors the Company s liquidity risk, particularly with respect to volatile and large deposits. The Company has not encountered, and does not anticipate problems with meeting its liquidity needs. Item 4: Controls and Procedures As of September 30, 2024, an evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)). Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There were no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the nine month period ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting. 

 43 

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION Item 1: Legal Proceedings The Bank is involved in various legal matters and claims which are being defended and handled in the ordinary course of business. None of these matters are expected, in the opinion of Management, to have a material adverse effect upon the financial position or results of operations of the Company. However, on June 30, 2023, Stilwell Activist Investments, L.P., issued a letter to the Company and each of the directors of the Company demanding that they immediately commence litigation on behalf of the Company for an alleged breach by the Company s Board of Directors of its fiduciary duties in allegedly failing to properly oversee and supervise Chevis and Tanner Swetman s management of the Company. At its July 2023 meeting, the Board of Directors of the Company established a Special Litigation Committee made up of the independent directors to investigate the allegations made in the letter. Rather than wait for the Special Litigation Committee to conclude its inquiry, Stilwell Activist Investments, L.P., filed on September 29, 2023, a Complaint against the Company and Directors Chevis Swetman, Padrick D. Dennis, Jeffrey H. O Keefe, Paige Reed Riley, Ronald Barnes, and George Sliman, III, making the same allegations that appear in the demand letter. The Court stayed the lawsuit pending the Special Litigation Committee s inquiry. The Special Litigation Committee concluded that pursuing the claims is not in the Company s best interest, and on March 22, 2024, the Company filed a motion to dismiss. The motion to dismiss was heard by the Court on October 17, 2024, and denied, allowing limited discovery as to the reasonableness of the Special Litigation Committee s inquiry. A final order from the Court on that motion is currently pending. The plaintiff, Stilwell Activist Investments, L.P., is a shareholder of record of the Company and is controlled by Joseph Stilwell, an individual who beneficially owns 13.7 of the issued and outstanding common stock of the Company according to an Amended Schedule 13D filed by Mr. Stilwell and his related entities with the SEC on September 26, 2024, disclosing Company stock beneficially owned by Mr. Stilwell s group. Mr. Stilwell and his related entities, including Stilwell Activist Investments, L.P., have nominated an individual for election to the Board of Directors of the Company at its last four annual meetings, but each individual nominated was not elected to the Board of Directors of the Company.
