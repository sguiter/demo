EXPLANATORY NOTE 
 
 KORE Group Holdings, Inc. (the Company is filing this Amendment No. 1 on Form 10-Q/A (the Amended Form 10-Q to amend and restate certain items in the Company s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, which was originally filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC on August 14, 2024 (the Original Form 10-Q ). 
 
 Restatement Background 
 
 As previously disclosed in Item 4.02 the Company s Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on November 12, 2024, subsequent to the filing of the Original Form 10-Q, the Company identified an error related to the calculation of the goodwill impairment which was reflected in the Company s Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements as of and for the three and six month periods ended June 30, 2024 (the Affected Period ). As a result of this calculation error in the second quarter of 2024, Operating loss for the three and six month periods ended June 30, 2024 was understated by 17.7 million in the Company s Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations, and at the same time, Goodwill as of June 30, 2024 was overstated by the same amount in the Company s Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet for the Affected Period included within the Original Form 10-Q (together, these adjustments are referred to as the Restatement Adjustments ). 
 
 Additionally, as of and for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, the Company identified other immaterial errors that have also been corrected with this filing (together, referred to as the Immaterial Error Corrections . The primary immaterial error that the Company identified was an error related to goodwill impairment and deferred taxes recorded at the goodwill impairment dates of the third quarter of 2023 and at year-end 2022. This accounting error occurred due to the need for a simultaneous equation that was required to be performed to accurately reflect the fact that the goodwill impairment occurred when the Company had tax deductible goodwill. In such cases, a simultaneous equation must be performed in order to properly reflect the balances of the remaining goodwill, deferred taxes, and impairment expense, to avoid increasing the value of the Company higher than the fair value used in the impairment calculation, as impairment expense decreases a deferred tax liability in the absence of controlling for that effect by performing a simultaneous equation in the calculation of impairment. Management evaluated the effect of the error on the quarterly condensed consolidated financial statements for the second quarter of 2024, the condensed consolidated quarterly and consolidated annual financial statements for 2023, and the annual consolidated financial statements for 2022, and concluded the error was not material. As a result, in the second quarter of 2024, the Company recorded an out of period adjustment to record an additional goodwill impairment of 2.8 million as of and for the period ended June 30, 2024, as a net result of additional goodwill impairment from prior periods increased by the deferred income tax effect. 
 
 On November 11, 2024 (the Determination Date ), the Company s management, in consultation with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company (the Audit Committee ), and in consultation with the Company s independent registered public accounting firm, BDO USA, P.C., concluded that the Company s previously issued Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for the Affected Period, as filed within the Original Form 10-Q, should no longer be relied upon. Accordingly, the Company concluded as of the Determination Date that such statements should be restated to correct the error in the calculation of the goodwill impairment as described in the preceding paragraph and the other identified immaterial errors. 
 
 The calculation errors in the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements as of and for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 do not impact Revenue, Cost of revenue, management incentive compensation, or any disclosed non-GAAP metrics, including Adjusted EBITDA.

 Part II - Item 6. Exhibits. 
 
 In addition, the Company has corrected the number of shares of common stock, par value 0.0001 per share common stock ), outstanding as of August 12, 2024, on the cover page of this Amended Form 10-Q in order to exclude 1,000,000 treasury shares that were erroneously included in the number of shares of common stock outstanding on the cover page of the Original Form 10-Q. 
 
 Finally, the Company has included in this Amended Form 10-Q updated certifications executed by the Company s principal executive officer and principal financial officer as of the date of this Amended Form 10-Q as required by Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.

 per share (the common stock ), is traded on the New York Stock Exchange (the NYSE under the ticker symbol KORE . The Company implemented a reverse stock split of its common stock at a ratio of 1-for-5 effective as of July 1, 2024. No fractional shares were issued in connection with the reverse stock split. Any fractional shares resulting from the reverse stock split, regardless of the fractional amount, resulted in an additional one share in lieu of such fractional share. The number of shares of common stock covered by the warrants outstanding at the effective time of the reverse stock split was reduced to one-fifth the number of shares of common stock covered by the warrants immediately preceding the reverse stock split, and the exercise price per share was increased by five times the exercise price immediately preceding the reverse stock split, resulting in the same aggregate price being required to be paid therefor upon exercise thereof as was required immediately preceding the reverse stock split. The reverse stock split did not affect the shares of preferred stock outstanding. All calculations have been adjusted to reflect the reverse stock split for all periods presented. 
 
 Restatement of Previously Issued Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements 
 
 The Company identified an error related to the calculation of the goodwill impairment which was reflected in the Company s Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements as of and for the three and six month periods ended June 30, 2024 (the Affected Period ). As a result of this calculation error in the second quarter of 2024, Operating loss for the three and six month periods ended June 30, 2024 was understated by million in the Company s Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations, and at the same time, Goodwill as of June 30, 2024 was overstated by the same amount in the Company s Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet for the Affected Period included within the Company s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, which was originally filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC on August 14, 2024 (together, these adjustments are referred to as the Restatement Adjustments ). Additionally, as of and for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, the Company identified other immaterial errors that have also been corrected herein (together, referred to as the Immaterial Error Corrections ). 
 
 Additionally, as of and for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, the Company identified other immaterial errors that have also been corrected with this filing (together, referred to as the Immaterial Error Corrections . The primary immaterial error that the Company identified was an error related to goodwill impairment and deferred taxes recorded at the goodwill impairment dates of the third quarter of 2023 and at year-end 2022. This accounting error occurred due to the need for a simultaneous equation that was required to be performed to accurately reflect the fact that the goodwill impairment occurred when the Company had tax deductible goodwill. In such cases, a simultaneous equation must be performed in order to properly reflect the balances of the remaining goodwill, deferred taxes, and impairment expense, to avoid increasing the value of the Company higher than the fair value used in the impairment calculation, as impairment expense decreases a deferred tax liability in the absence of controlling for that effect by performing a simultaneous equation in the calculation of impairment. Management evaluated the effect of the error on the quarterly condensed consolidated financial statements for the second quarter of 2024, the condensed consolidated quarterly and consolidated annual financial statements for 2023, and the annual consolidated financial statements for 2022, and concluded the error was not material. As a result, in the second quarter of 2024, the Company recorded an out of period adjustment to record an additional goodwill impairment of million as of and for the period ended June 30, 2024, as a net result of additional goodwill impairment from prior periods increased by the deferred income tax effect.

The Penny Warrants are considered a freestanding derivative instrument, as they are separable and legally detachable from the Series A-1 preferred stock, were issued for nominal or no apparent consideration, and have the essential characteristics inherent in a derivative instrument of a notional amount, an underlying security, and a mechanism for net settlement.

(1) No such instruments existed during the three and six months ended June 30, 2023; therefore, there were no gains or losses from such instruments during those periods. 

NOTE 7 

Penny Warrants 
 
 The Penny Warrants, issued in 2023, are marked to fair value by reference to the fair value of the Company s stock price on the last day of the reporting period, less the exercise price, and are therefore considered as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. The fair value of the Company s stock as of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, less the exercise price, resulted in a Penny Warrants valuation of approximately million and million as of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 
 Private Placement Warrants 
 
 The Private Placement Warrants are marked to fair value by reference to the fair value of the Company s public warrants, which are therefore considered as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. The public warrants were traded on the NYSE under the ticker symbol KORE.WS until December 2023, at which point the listing transferred to the OTC Pink Marketplace under the ticker symbol KORGW. As of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the aggregate value of the Private Placement Warrants was , as the reference price of the KORGW warrants was less than one cent per warrant. 
 
 Financial Instruments Held at Amortized Cost for Which Fair Value is Disclosed 
 
 Financial instruments for which cost approximates fair value 
 
 Cash, including restricted cash, is stated at cost, which approximates fair value. The carrying amounts reported in the balance sheet for accounts receivable (including contract assets), accounts payable, and accrued liabilities (including contract liabilities) approximate fair value, due to their short-term maturities.

 Additional disclosures regarding Level 3 unobservable inputs - Backstop Notes 
 
 We use a third party valuation firm who utilizes proprietary methodologies to value our Backstop Notes. This firm uses a lattice modeling technique to determine the fair value of this Level 3 liability. Use of this technique requires determination of relevant inputs and assumptions, some of which represent significant unobservable inputs such as credit spreads and equity volatility based on guideline companies, as well as other valuation assumptions. Accordingly, a significant increase or decrease in any of these inputs in isolation may result in a significantly lower or higher fair value measurement.

 As of June 30, 2024, we used a third party valuation firm who utilizes proprietary methodologies to value our Mandatorily Redeemable Preferred Stock Due to Affiliate. This firm used a lattice modeling technique to determine the fair value of this liability determined as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy as of June 30, 2024. Use of this technique requires determination of relevant inputs and assumptions, some of which represent significant unobservable inputs such as credit spreads and equity volatility based on guideline companies, as well as other valuation assumptions.

 RSUs vested, with shares withheld for taxes, for a net settlement of shares of common stock issued in conjunction with these RSUs. The acceleration of the expense resulted in an increase of million to selling, general, and administrative expenses for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, which was partially offset by certain reversals of expense relating to other of Mr. Bahl s one market-based grant, as further described below, and a partial reversal of performance share unit awards PSU overall based on the Company s current expectations around meeting the performance metrics (which was also applicable to all participants with unvested PSUs). 
 
 Further to the mutual agreement, Mr. Bahl s unvested PSUs are to vest if and when they vest for individuals employed by the Company. The 2022 PSU award and the 2023 PSU award will vest fully in 2025 and 2026, respectively, should the criteria be met. 
 
 Finally, Mr. Bahl s unvested market-based RSU award of shares was forfeited in accordance with the terms of the award agreement. The market conditions associated with this award required vesting on the day after the closing price of the Company s common stock achieved dollars per share or higher for at least out of any consecutive period ending on or prior to June 30, 2026. The fair value of the RSUs was previously estimated to be per RSU using a Monte-Carlo simulation model considering the term, volatility, risk-free rates and the vesting conditions, including service through June 30, 2026. The expense previously recorded on these RSUs was reversed, as the service condition of the award will not be met. Reversal of this expense resulted in an immaterial decrease to selling, general, and administrative expenses for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024.

 In determining the weighted average shares outstanding for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 for both basic and diluted earnings per share, the Company included the Penny Warrants issued to Searchlight in transactions dated November 15, 2023 and December 13, 2023, as the common shares of stock that would be issuable upon the exercise of such warrants are issuable for nominal consideration per share of common stock or cashless exercise at the option of Searchlight. The Penny Warrants were exercisable immediately upon issuance, although no such warrants had been exercised as of June 30, 2024.

(1) Common stock issuable under the Backstop Notes is presented at the maximum number of shares of common stock potentially issuable upon the exercise of the Backstop Notes, although the actual potentially issuable shares remain limited at of the common stock outstanding. 
 
 (2) The number of shares of common stock covered by warrants outstanding at the effective time of the reverse stock split was reduced to one-fifth the number of shares of common stock covered by the warrants immediately preceding the reverse stock split, and the exercise price per share was increased by five times the exercise price immediately preceding the reverse stock split, resulting in the same aggregate price being required to be paid therefor upon exercise thereof as was required immediately preceding the reverse stock split. 
 
 Unvested restricted stock units with time and performance conditions are excluded from the disclosure of the number of potentially anti-dilutive securities because the performance conditions were not met at the end of the reporting periods. Therefore, these securities are not considered to be contingently issuable for purposes of dilutive EPS or anti-dilution calculations.

Searchlight is therefore considered an affiliate of the Company, and of the Company s Board members are employed by Searchlight. Searchlight owns the Series A-1 preferred stock and the Penny Warrants. 
 
 Searchlight, as the current sole owner of the Series A-1 preferred stock, is solely owed the accrued interest arising from the Series A-1 preferred stock outstanding, which interest is referred to in the Series A-1 preferred stock Certificate of Designations as Dividends . The dividend rate means, initially, per annum, and dividends on each share of Series A-1 preferred stock shall (i) accrue on the liquidation preference of such share and on any accrued dividends on such share, on a daily basis from and including the issuance date of such share, whether or not declared, whether or not the Company has earnings and whether or not the Company has assets legally available to make payment thereof, at a rate equal to the dividend rate, (ii) compound quarterly and (iii) be payable quarterly in arrears, in accordance with the section, below, on each dividend payment date, commencing on December 31, 2023. Dividends on the Series A-1 preferred stock shall accrue on the basis of a 365-day year based on actual days elapsed. The amount of dividends payable with respect to any share of Series A-1 preferred stock for any dividend payment period shall equal the sum of the daily dividend amounts accrued with respect to such share during such dividend payment period. 
 
 Dividends on the Series A-1 preferred stock shall be payable in cash only if, as and when declared by the Board, and, if not declared by the Board, the amount of accrued Dividends shall be automatically increased, without any action on the part of the Company or any other person, in an amount equal to the amount of the Dividend to be paid. For further clarity, if the Board does not declare and pay in cash, or the Company otherwise for any reason fails to pay in cash, on any dividend payment date, the full amount of any accrued and unpaid Dividend on the Series A-1 preferred stock since the most recent dividend payment date, then the amount of such unpaid Dividend shall automatically be added to the amount of accrued Dividends on such share on the applicable dividend payment date without any action on the part of the Company or any other person. 
 
 Cerberus Telecom Acquisition Corp. CTAC 
 
 CTAC was the initial private equity sponsor of the Company, and two of the Company s Board members are employed by CTAC. CTAC is therefore considered an affiliate of the Company. CTAC owns over but less than of the outstanding common stock of the Company. 
 
 Affiliates of CTAC own the Private Placement Warrants. 
 
 ABRY Partners, LLC ABRY 
 
 ABRY beneficially owned approximately of the Company s outstanding common stock as of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. ABRY is therefore considered an affiliate of the Company, and two of the Company s Board members are employed by ABRY. 
 
 HealthEZ, an ABRY portfolio company, is the Company s health insurance third-party administrator. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, the administration costs incurred with HealthEZ were million and million, respectively. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, the administration costs incurred with HealthEZ were million and million, respectively. Aggregate expenses are recorded as a component of selling, general, and administrative expenses incurred with affiliates in the condensed consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss. 
 Transactions with affiliates of one of the Company s wholly-owned subsidiaries 
 
 A wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company located in Brazil maintained an office lease and professional services agreement with a company controlled by a key member of the subsidiary s management team. The office lease and professional services agreement with this affiliate were terminated on June 29, 2023, and thus, such expenses were incurred for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024. 
 
 Aggregate expenses incurred for these transactions were million and million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, respectively, and are recorded as a component of selling, general, and administrative expenses incurred with affiliates in the condensed consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss. 
 
 The same wholly-owned subsidiary had an informal services agreement with a separate company controlled by key members of the Company s management team. This services agreement was entered into to render technical assistance services to purchase and deliver telecommunication equipment to the Company s clients in Brazil, for which the affiliate was paid a nominal monthly fixed fee plus a fee of of the gross amount of the cost incurred to purchase and deliver telecommunication equipment to the Company s clients in Brazil. These expenses are recorded as a component of selling, general, and administrative expenses incurred with affiliates in the condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss for the relevant periods as disclosed below. 
 
 The service agreement with this affiliate was terminated on February 14, 2023, and thus, such expenses were incurred for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, and three months ended June 30, 2023. For the six months ended June 30, 2023, the Company incurred and paid million to this affiliate.

 million and million. The low end of the possible range of loss, which is the amount required to be recorded as a contingent loss by GAAP, is substantially unchanged from the low end of the possible range of loss as of December 31, 2023, and additional loss or recovery estimates have been recorded for the period ended June 30, 2024. 
 
 The range of loss in this matter described above includes anticipation of recoveries from third parties at the low end, and no recoveries from third parties anticipated at the high end of the range, with interest and penalties assessed at both the low and high ends of the range, with penalties reduced in states where the Company intends to seek a voluntary disclosure arrangement as described further below. Although the Company s contracts with customers generally state that the customer must later pay associated taxes if such taxes become an issue, there is always a risk of customer non-payment. Due to the complexities involved in its number of customers, use cases, and jurisdictions in which it does business, along with the treatment of potential indirect taxes varying in each jurisdiction, and collectability estimates, this estimate may ultimately be resolved at either a greater or lesser amount than the estimated range. 
 
 Additionally, mitigating factors may exist, such as good-faith reseller certificates, which the Company has previously obtained in instances where the use case indicates that the customer is a reseller, private letter rulings that the Company may request from certain states where the specific tax law is unclear but may be resolved in the Company s favor, and voluntary disclosure arrangements whereby the Company may determine that it is probable that tax would be owed and enter into an agreement with a taxing jurisdiction to pay back taxes and avoid penalties that would otherwise likely apply. 
 
 The Company expects this matter to be settled within the next twelve months, and thus, the net contingent liability estimate of million remains accrued in accrued liabilities within current liabilities of the Company s condensed consolidated balance sheets as of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

These charges are primarily related to severance payments and employee benefits. The Company expects substantially all of the actions associated with the plan to be completed by December 31, 2024. 
 
 The estimate of the charges that the Company expects to incur in connection with the plan, and the timing thereof, are subject to a number of assumptions, including local employment law requirements in various jurisdictions, and actual amounts may differ materially from estimates. In addition, the Company may incur other charges not currently contemplated due to unanticipated events that may occur, including in connection with the implementation of the plan.

 Restatement of Previously Issued Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements 
 
 In this Amendment No. 1 on Form 10-Q/A, we have restated our previously issued Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements as of and for the three and six month periods ended June 30, 2024 (the Affected Period ). As a result, we have also revised certain previously reported financial information for the Affected Period in this Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations including, but not limited to, information within the Results of Operations for the Three and Six Months Ended June 30, 2024 and 2023 section to conform the discussion with the appropriate restated amounts. See Part I, Item 1. Financial Statements (Unaudited), Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies for additional information related to the restatement. 
 
 Overview 
 
 We offer IoT connectivity to the Internet Connectivity and other IoT solutions IoT Solutions to our customers. We are one of the largest global independent IoT enablers, delivering critical services globally to customers to deploy, manage, and scale their IoT application and use cases. We provide advanced connectivity services, location-based services, device solutions, and managed and professional services used in the development and support of IoT solutions and applications. Our IoT platform is delivered in partnership with the world s largest mobile network operators and provides secure, reliable, wireless Internet connectivity to mobile and fixed devices. This technology enables us to expand our global technology platform by transferring capabilities across our five vertical markets comprised of (i) Connected Health, (ii) Fleet Management, (iii) Asset Monitoring, (iv) Retail Communications Services and (v) Industrial IoT, and to deliver complementary products to channel partners and resellers worldwide. 
 
 Our industry verticals are not considered to be segments for the purposes of financial reporting, as discrete financial information is not available for the aforementioned verticals (or that of connectivity vs solutions) below the level of costs of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, and our Chief Operating Decision Maker CODM reviews financial information presented on a consolidated basis for purposes of making operating decisions, allocating resources, and evaluating financial performance. Our CODM is our Interim President and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Ronald Totton. 
 
 Trends and Recent Developments 
 
 Overall macroeconomic environment and its effect on us 
 
 Trends in the overall U.S. economy in the first six months of 2024 reflected an uncertain economic environment, which included sustained high interest rates in the U.S., uncertainty surrounding an upcoming U.S. presidential election, and regional conflicts around the world, all of which increase the unpredictability of the overall macroeconomic outlook for the remainder of 2024. Additionally, the U.S. unemployment rate has continued to increase over 2024, with the metric of long-term unemployment comprising nearly a quarter of unemployed individuals, which is an indicator of increasing softness in the U.S. economy. 
 
 At this time, we generally expect revenue derived from the Connectivity verticals of our business to remain fairly stable, given the stickiness of this revenue, while the more volatile IoT Managed Services (or IoTMS business verticals consisting of Solutions and Products may experience uneven revenue on both an actual and projected basis. We expect that IoTMS projects may be delayed by customers, due to overall macroeconomic conditions. We further expect that the overall IoT market may become more competitive from a pricing standpoint, and that our existing customers will continue to seek efficiency in terms of their operating expenses, all of which may create pressure on our revenue. 
 
 Recent developments in our business 
 
 Effective on May 3, 2024, pursuant to the mutual agreement of our Board of Directors (the Board and Romil Bahl, Mr. Bahl stepped down as President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company and a member of the Board. Also effective on May 3, 2024, Ronald Totton was appointed by the Board as our Interim President and Chief Executive Officer. 
 
 On June 12, 2024, at our 2024 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, our stockholders approved a reverse stock split of the Company s common stock, 0.0001 par value per share (the common stock ), at a ratio of not less than 1-for-4 and not greater than 1-for-10 (or any whole number in between). The Board subsequently determined that the ratio of the reverse stock split should be 1-for-5 and the reverse stock split with that ratio became effective as of July 1, 2024. 
 
 On August 14, 2024, as disclosed in Part II, Item 5. Other Information of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we announced a restructuring plan to streamline operations and reduce costs. It is estimated that the plan will impact between 170 and 240 employees and contractors in all areas across all functions. We estimate that we will incur restructuring charges approximately between 5.0 million and 6.0 million in 
 24 

connection with the plan during the third quarter of 2024. These charges are primarily related to severance payments and employee benefits. We expect substantially all of the actions associated with the plan to be completed by December 31, 2024 . 
 
 The estimate of the charges that we expect to incur in connection with the plan, and the timing thereof, are subject to a number of assumptions, including local employment law requirements in various jurisdictions, and actual amounts may differ materially from estimates. In addition, we may incur other charges not currently contemplated due to unanticipated events that may occur, including in connection with the implementation of the plan. 

Results of Operations for the Three and Six Months Ended June 30, 2024 and 2023: 
 
 Revenue 
 
 We derive revenue from IoT Connectivity services and IoT Solutions services (collectively, the Services as well as products including IoT Connectivity (consisting of subscriber identity module SIM cards) and IoT devices (within a comprehensive IoT solution) together referred to as Products . 
 
 Revenue arising from IoT Connectivity services generally consists of a monthly subscription fee and additional data usage fees that are part of a bundled solution which enables other providers and enterprise customers to complete their platforms for solutions to provide IoT Connectivity or other IoT Solutions. IoT Connectivity also includes charges for each SIM sold to a customer. 
 
 Revenue from IoT Solutions is derived from IoT device management services, location-based software services, and IoT security software services. Fees charged for device management services include the cost of the underlying IoT device and the cost of deploying and managing such devices. Fees charged for device management services are generally billed on the basis of a fee per deployed IoT device, which depends on the scope of the underlying services and the IoT device being deployed. Location-based software services and IoT security software services are charged monthly on a per-subscriber basis.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 
 In conjunction with net income (loss) calculated in accordance with GAAP, we also use EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to evaluate our ongoing operations and for internal planning and forecasting purposes. Non-GAAP financial information is presented for supplemental informational purposes only, should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with GAAP, and may be different from similarly-titled non-GAAP measures used by other companies. We believe that along with our GAAP financial information, our non-GAAP financial information when taken collectively and evaluated appropriately, is helpful to investors in assessing our operating performance. 
 
 EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA 
 
 EBITDA is defined as net income (loss) before interest expense, income tax expense or benefit, and depreciation and amortization. 
 
 Adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA adjusted for certain unusual and other significant items and removes the volatility associated with non-cash items and operational income and expenses that are not expected to be ongoing. Such adjustments include goodwill impairment charges, changes in the fair value of certain of our warrants required by GAAP to be accounted for at fair value, gains or losses on debt extinguishment, transformation expenses as defined below, acquisition costs, integration-related restructuring costs, stock-based compensation, and foreign currency gains and losses. 
 
 The following tables set forth a reconciliation of net loss to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023:

 (1) Other adjustments are comprised of adjustments for certain indirect or non-income based taxes. 
 
 Transformation expenses are related to the implementation of our strategic transformation plan and include the costs of a re-write of our core technology platform, expenses incurred to design certain new IoT Solutions, and go-to-market capabilities. These expenses were completed in 2023. 
 
 Integration-related restructuring costs for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 were primarily comprised of retention bonuses, severances, license and subscription fees, and professional services related to integration of previously acquired businesses. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, these costs were primarily associated with legal, accounting diligence, quality of earnings, valuation, and search expenses related to the acquisition of the Twilio IoT business. 

Key Operational Metrics 
 
 We review a number of operational metrics to measure our performance, identify trends affecting our business, prepare financial projections, and make strategic decisions. The operational metrics identified by management as key operational metrics are Total Number of Connections, Average Connections, Dollar-Based Net Expansion Rate, Total Contract Value, and Average Revenue per User. 
 
 Total Number of Connections and Average Connections 
 
 Our Total Number of Connections at period end constitutes the total of all our IoT Connectivity services connections, which includes the contribution of eSIMs but excludes certain connections where mobile carriers license our subscription management platform from us. The Average Connections Count is the simple average of the total connections during the relevant fiscal period(s) presented. 
 
 These metrics are the principal measures used by management to assess the growth of the business on a periodic basis, on a SIM and / or device-based perspective. We believe that investors also use these metrics for similar purposes. 
 
 The table below sets forth our Total Number of Connections as of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023: 
 
 June 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Total Number of Connections at period end 18.6 million 18.5 million 
 
 The table below sets forth our Average Connections Count for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023: 
 
 June 30, 2024 June 30, 2023 Average Connections Count for the three months ended 18.5 million 16.5 million Average Connections Count for the six months ended 18.3 million 15.8 million 
 30 

Period-end and average connections as of both periods presented and for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 included an increase of approximately 3.5 million connections related to the acquisition of Twilio s IoT business. 
 
 Dollar Based Net Expansion Rate DBNER 
 
 DBNER tracks the combined effect of cross-sales of IoT Solutions to KORE s existing customers, its customer retention and the growth of its existing business. KORE calculates DBNER by dividing the revenue for a given period given period from existing go-forward customers by the revenue from the same customers for the same period measured one year prior base period ). 
 
 The revenue included in the current period excludes revenue from (i) customers that are non-go-forward customers, meaning customers that have either communicated to KORE before the last day of the current period their intention not to provide future business to KORE or customers that KORE has determined are transitioning away from KORE based on a sustained multi-year time period of declines in revenue and (ii) new customers that started generating revenue after the end of the base period. For the purposes of calculating DBNER, if KORE acquires a company during the given per iod or the base period, then the revenue of a customer before the acquisition but during either the given period or the base period is included in the calculation. For example, to calculate our DBNER for the trailing 12 months ended June 30, 2024, we divide (i) revenue, for the trailing 12 months ended June 30, 2024, from go-forward customers that started generating revenue on or before June 30, 2023 , by (ii) revenue, for the trailing 12 months ended June 30, 2023 , from the same cohort of customers. 
 
 It is often difficult to ascertain which customers should be deemed not to be go-forward customers for purposes of calculating DBNER. Customers are not required to give notice of their intention to transition off of the KORE platform, and a customer s exit from the KORE platform can take months or longer, and total connections of any particular customer can at any time increase or decrease for any number of reasons, including pricing, customer satisfaction or product fit accordingly, a decrease in total connections may not indicate that a customer is intending to exit the KORE platform, particularly if that decrease is not sustained over a period of several quarters. DBNER would be lower if it were calculated using revenue from non-go-forward customers. 
 
 DBNER is used by management as a measure of growth of KORE s existing customers (i.e., same store growth) and as a measure of customer retention, from a revenue perspective. It is not intended to capture the effect of either new customer wins or the declines from non-go-forward customers on KORE s total revenue growth. This is because DBNER excludes new customers who started generating revenue after the base period and also excludes any customers who are non-go-forward customers on the last day of the current period. Revenue increases from new customer wins, and a decline in revenue from non-go-forward customers are also important factors in assessing KORE s revenue growth, but these factors are independent of DBNER. 
 
 KORE s DBNER was 92 for the twelve months ended June 30, 2024, as compared to 99 for the twelve months ended June 30, 2023. This decrease was primarily due to decreased IoT solutions revenue from certain IoT Solutions customers. 
 
 Total Contract Value TCV 
 
 TCV represents our estimated value of a revenue opportunity. TCV for an IoT Connectivity opportunity is calculated by multiplying by 40 the estimated revenue expected to be generated during the twelfth month of production. TCV for an IoT Solutions opportunity is either the actual total expected revenue opportunity, or if it is a longer-term programmatically recurring revenue program, calculated for the first 36 months of the delivery period. TCV is used by management as a measure of the revenue opportunity of KORE s sales funnel, which we define as opportunities our sales team is actively pursuing, potentially leading to future revenue. 
 
 As of June 30, 2024, our sales funnel included over 1,148 opportunities with an estimated potential TCV of over 437 million. As of June 30, 2023, our sales funnel included over 1,500 opportunities with an estimated potential TCV of 660 million. 
 
 Average Revenue per User ARPU 
 
 ARPU is used by management as a measure to assess the revenue generated per connection. It is calculated by dividing the total IoT connectivity revenue during the period by the total number of connections during that same period. We believe that ARPU is an important metric for both management and investors to help in understanding the financial performance and effectiveness of the Company s monetization per connection. 
 
 ARPU was 1.00 and 0.98 for the three months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 1.03 and 0.98 for the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 Overview 
 
 Liquidity is a measurement of our ability to meet potential cash requirements, including ongoing commitments to repay borrowings, fund our operating costs, and satisfy other general business needs. Our liquidity requirements have historically arisen from our working capital needs, obligations to make scheduled payments of interest and principal on our indebtedness, and capital expenditures to facilitate the growth and expansion of the business, which was historically accomplished via acquisitions. We do not plan on any acquisitions in the foreseeable future. 
 
 Going forward, we may continue to utilize borrowings, including bank credit facilities and lines of credit, to fund our liquidity requirements. We are highly leveraged, and such borrowings may not be available with attractive terms or at all. We may also seek to raise additional capital through public or private offerings of equity, equity-related, or debt securities, depending upon market conditions. The use of any particular source of capital and funds will depend on market conditions and the availability, if any, of these sources. 
 
 We believe these identified sources of financing will be adequate for purposes of meeting our short term (within one year) and our longer term liquidity needs. We cannot predict with certainty the specific transactions we will undertake to generate sufficient liquidity to meet our obligations as they come due. We will adjust our plans as appropriate in response to changes in our expectations and any potential changes in market conditions.

 Term Loan and Revolving Credit Facility WhiteHorse Capital Management, LLC WhiteHorse 
 
 On November 9, 2023, the Company, only with respect to certain limited sections thereof, and certain subsidiaries of the Company entered into a credit agreement with WhiteHorse that consisted of a senior secured term loan of 185.0 million Term Loan as well as a senior secured revolving credit facility of 25.0 million (the Revolving Credit Facility and, together with the Term Loan, the Credit Facilities ). Borrowings under the Term Loan and the Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at a rate at the Company s option of either (1) Term SOFR for a specified interest period (at the Company s option) of one to three months plus an applicable margin of up to 6.50 or (2) a base rate plus an applicable margin of up to 5.50 . The Term SOFR rate is subject to a floor of 1.0 . The applicable margins for Term SOFR rate and base rate borrowings are each subject to a reduction to 6.25 and 6.00 if the Company maintains a first lien net leverage ratio of less than 2.25:1.00 and greater than or equal to 1.75:1.00 and less than 1.75:1.00, respectively. Interest is paid on the last business day of each quarterly interest period except at maturity. The credit agreement became effective on November 15, 2023. 
 
 Principal payments of approximately 0.5 million are due on the last business day of each quarter. The maturity date of the Credit Facilities is November 15, 2028. 
 
 As of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there were no amounts outstanding on the Revolving Credit Facility. 
 
 The Credit Facilities are secured by substantially all of the Company s subsidiaries assets. The Term Loan agreement restricts cash dividends and other distributions from the Company s subsidiaries to the Company and also restricts the Company s ability to pay cash dividends to its stockholders. 
 
 The Credit Facilities are subject to customary financial covenants including to the Total Net Leverage Ratio, defined as, with respect to any period end, the ratio of (a) Consolidated Total Debt to (b) Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the credit agreement, as discussed below); and First Lien Net Leverage Ratio defined as, with respect to any period end, the ratio of (a) Consolidated First Lien Debt to (b) Consolidated EBITDA. Consolidated EBITDA as defined by the credit agreement is equivalent to our Adjusted EBITDA, as presented in Part I, Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Non-GAAP Financial Measures.

The amount of dividends payable with respect to any share of Series A-1 preferred stock for any dividend payment period shall equal the sum of the daily dividend amounts accrued with respect to such share during such dividend payment period. 
 
 Dividends on the Series A-1 preferred stock shall be payable in cash only if, as and when declared by the Board, and, if not declared by the Board, the amount of accrued Dividends shall be automatically increased, without any action on the part of the Company or any other person, in an amount equal to the amount of the Dividend to be paid. For further clarity, if the Board does not declare and pay in cash, or the Company otherwise for any reason fails to pay in cash, on any dividend payment date, the full amount of any accrued and unpaid Dividend on the Series A-1 preferred stock since the most recent dividend payment date, then the amount of such unpaid Dividend shall automatically be added to the amount of accrued Dividends on such share on the applicable dividend payment date without any action on the part of the Company or any other person. 
 
 Cash Flows 
 
 Six Months Ended June 30, (in thousands) 2024 2023 Net cash provided by operating activities 5,890 1,303 Net cash used in investing activities (8,784) (10,245) Net cash used in financing activities (1,739) (2,654) 
 
 Cash flows from operating activities 
 
 Cash provided by operating activities for the six months ended June 30, 2024 increased from 2023 primarily due to the accrual of interest payable to affiliate remaining unpaid, timing of accounts payable and receivable and change in fair value of warrant liabilities to affiliate. 
 
 Cash flows from investing activities 
 
 Cash used in investing activities for the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023 was primarily used for investments in internally developed software and purchases of property and equipment. 
 
 Cash flows from financing activities 
 
 Cash used in financing activities for the six months ended June 30, 2024, was primarily due to scheduled principal payments on the Term Loan. During 2023, cash used in financing activities was primarily due to scheduled principal payments on the prior term loan. 
 
 Cash Availability 
 
 We have the ability to defer cash payment of dividends (which are accounted for under GAAP as interest due to the debt-like features of the underlying instrument) due on the Series A-1 preferred stock, and plan to defer such payments in the near term in order to preserve cash for other purposes. As of June 30, 2024, we owed approximately 12.8 million in such dividend liability, which is due to an affiliate (Searchlight). We had a total of 47.2 million of purchase commitments payable that were not recorded as liabilities on our condensed consolidated balance sheet as of June 30, 2024, of which 13.8 million is expected to be purchased through the remainder of 2024. 
 
 As of June 30, 2024, we had approximately 22.3 million of cash on hand. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 
 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates. A discussion of critical accounting policies and estimates is included in Part II, Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Critical Accounting Estimates in the Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our critical accounting policies and estimates have not materially changed since December 31, 2023. 
 
 Management discusses the ongoing development and selection of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. 
 
 34 

We expect quarter-to-quarter GAAP earnings volatility from our business activities. This volatility can occur for a variety of reasons, particularly changes in assessments of indicators of impairment regarding goodwill. In addition, the amount or timing of our reported earnings may be impacted by technical accounting issues and estimates. 

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 
 As a smaller reporting company, we are not required to provide this information. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 
 Disclosure controls and procedures 
 
 The Company conducted an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s management, including the Company s Chief Executive Officer (principal executive officer) and Chief Financial Officer (principal financial officer) of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13(a)-15(e) and 15(d)-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )) as of June 30, 2024. At the time of the filing of the Company s Original Form 10-Q, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of June 30, 2024 due to the material weaknesses in the Company s internal control over financial reporting as reported in its Annual Report on Form 10-K. Subsequent to that evaluation, on November 11, 2024, the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of June 30, 2024 due to the foregoing material weaknesses and the continuing material weaknesses in the Company s internal control over financial reporting as described below. 
 
 A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company s annual or interim consolidated financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. We have identified the following additional unremediated material weakness in internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2024. 
 
 Subsequent to the filing of the Original Form 10-Q, the Company concluded that it did not design effective management review controls related to the calculation of, and disclosure of, goodwill impairment. This continued material weakness in the Company s Financial Statement Close Process resulted in a material error in the Company s previously issued Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements as of and for the three and six month periods ended June 30, 2024 included in the Original Form 10-Q leading to the restatement of these financial statements in this Amendment No. 1 on Form 10-Q/A. 
 
 The Company continues the process of designing and implementing effective internal control measures to improve its internal control over financial reporting and remediate these material weaknesses. 
 
 Changes in internal control over financial reporting 
 
 During the quarter ended June 30, 2024, except for the changes related to the remediation of material weaknesses referenced above, there have been no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

PART II OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
 
 From time to time, we are subject to various legal proceedings, lawsuits, disputes and claims arising in the ordinary course of our business. Although the outcome of these and other claims cannot be predicted with certainty, there are currently no pending legal proceedings that are expected to be material to us. 

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 
 
 For a discussion of potential risks and uncertainties applicable to us, see the information under Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors in the Annual Report on Form 10-K. The risks described in the Annual Report on Form 10-K are not the only risks facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, or future results. 
 
 As of the date of this Amendment No. 1 on Form 10-Q/A, there have been no material changes with regard to the Risk Factors disclosed in the Annual Report on Form 10-K except as set forth below. 
 
 The ultimate effect of the 1-for-5 reverse stock split on the market price of our common stock cannot be predicted with any certainty and shares of our common stock have likely experienced decreased liquidity as a result of such reverse stock split. 
 
 On July 1, 2024, the Company effected a 1-for-5 reverse stock split of its common stock. The liquidity of our common stock may be adversely affected given the reduced number of shares of our common stock that are now outstanding following the reverse stock split. As a result of the lower number of shares outstanding following the reverse stock split, the market for our common stock may also become more volatile, which may lead to reduced trading and a smaller number of market makers for our common stock. Our share price may not attract new investors, including institutional investors. In addition, the market price of our common stock may not satisfy the investing requirements of those investors. The trading liquidity of our common stock may not improve. All the foregoing risks may result in a material adverse effect to our stockholders. 
 
 Our liabilities exceed our assets, which may have a material adverse effect on our ability to raise further equity capital, refinance our debt on favorable terms or at all, or issue new debt . 
 
 The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Amendment No. 1 on Form 10-Q/A reflect that the book value of our liabilities exceeds the book value of our assets. Further, the fair value of our debt reflects a discount to its par (or principal) value. We may therefore face constraints on ability to raise further equity capital, refinance our debt on favorable terms or at all, or issue new debt, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business. 
 
 We face risks related to the restatement of our previously issued condensed consolidated financial statements and financial information for the interim financial period for the second quarter of 2024, which may adversely impact our business. 
 
 As described in Item 4.02 of our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on November 12, 2024, during the preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, we concluded that the Company s previously issued unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements contained within the Company s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, which was originally filed with the SEC on August 14, 2024 (the Original Form 10-Q ), should no longer be relied upon, and that such financial statements should be restated. It was concluded that the Company s goodwill impairment expense was materially misstated in the second quarter of 2024. The conclusion was based on management s determination that it miscalculated its goodwill impairment for the quarter ending June 30, 2024 by deducting debt issuance costs from the fair value of the debt which was then used to determine the value of the Company s goodwill impairment at that time. The debt issuance costs should not have been deducted from the fair value of the associated debt. 
 
 As a result of the restatement, we are subject to a number of additional risks and uncertainties which may affect investor confidence in the accuracy of our financial disclosures and may raise reputational issues for our business. We expect to continue to face many risks and challenges related to the restatement, including the risk that the processes undertaken to effect the restatement may not have been adequate to identify and correct all errors in our historical financial statements and, as a result, we may discover additional errors and our financial statements remain subject to the risk of future restatement. We are also at risk of potential litigation or other disputes which may include, among others, claims invoking the federal and state securities laws, or other claims arising from the restatement. As of the date of this Amendment No. 1 on Form 10-Q/A, we are not aware of any such disputes arising out of the restatement. If one or more of the foregoing risks or challenges persist, our business, operations and financial condition are likely to be materially and adversely affected. 

ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALE OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS 
 
 Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities 
 
 The following table sets forth information with respect to our repurchases of common stock in each month of the second quarter of 2024:

 (1) During the second quarter of 2024, the above shares of common stock were surrendered by employees vesting in RSUs in order to pay for applicable tax withholding. Under the KORE Group Holdings, Inc. 2021 Long-Term Stock Incentive Plan Incentive Plan ), participants may surrender shares as payment of applicable tax withholding on the vesting of equity awards. Shares so surrendered by participants in the Incentive Plan are repurchased pursuant to the terms of the Incentive Plan and / or applicable inducement award agreement and not pursuant to publicly announced share repurchase programs. The average price per share deemed paid is calculated using the closing stock price on the vesting date. These shares of common stock have been cancelled.

ITEM 5. OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 Rule 10b5-1 trading plan(s) 
 
 During the quarter ended June 30, 2024, none of our directors or officers (as defined in Rule 16a-1(f) of the Exchange Act) or a Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement or non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement (as such terms are defined in Item 408 of Regulation S-K of the Securities Act. 
 
 Restructuring Plan 
 
 On August 14, 2024, the Company has committed to a restructuring plan to streamline operations and reduce costs. It is estimated that the plan will impact between 170 and 240 employees and contractors in all areas across all functions. The Company estimates that it will incur restructuring charges approximately between 5.0 million and 6.0 million in connection with the plan during the third quarter of 2024. These charges are primarily related to severance payments and employee benefits. The Company expects substantially all of the actions associated with the plan to be completed by December 31, 2024. 
 
 The estimate of the charges that the Company expects to incur in connection with the plan, and the timing thereof, are subject to a number of assumptions, including local employment law requirements in various jurisdictions, and actual amounts may differ materially from estimates. In addition, the Company may incur other charges not currently contemplated due to unanticipated events that may occur, including in connection with the implementation of the plan.
