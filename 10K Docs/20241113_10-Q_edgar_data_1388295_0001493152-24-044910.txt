ITEM
2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

You
should read the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the condensed financial
statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and with our audited financial statements included
in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 2023 Form 10-K ). In addition to historical condensed
financial information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates, and beliefs. Our
actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. 

Overview 

The
Company operates to develop artificial intelligence products that enable companies and individuals to reach their highest potential by
eliminating language barriers in daily communications by providing high-quality, accurate, and efficient interpretation and translation
services using natural language processing (NLP) technology. The Company s focus is on developing a proprietary architecture that
is faster and more accurate than any other company, with a commitment to providing superior quality services to its customers. The Company
intends to serve a wide variety of markets and customers and will be focused on becoming a leader in the creation of pragmatic products
for the interpretation and translation industry . 

Business
Summary 

At
the time of its initial formation in 2006, the Company was a development stage company that offered live promotions and marketing events
using custom-built mobile displays. 

Today,
the Company is developing a stack of cutting-edge artificial intelligence technologies that solve everyday problems with an innovative
and pragmatic approach. Using natural language processing sentiment analytics and behavioral prediction to metaverse enhancement, the
Company is attempting to solve problems that will elevate our human condition. 

The
Company has recently launched two products: Verbum, which is a platform that enables fluent and effective communication among individuals
that do not speak the same language; and Verbum SDK. Verbum SDK is a software development kit that allows developers to create multi-language
translation tools for their own use. 

Our
Products 

The
Company s current products described in detail below have proprietary technology and associated patents. The Company is currently
working on patents for future product offerings. 

Verbum .
 Verbum supports real time web-based conversations, discussions, meetings, and online chats in 150 languages, enabling fluent and
 effective communication among individuals that do not speak the same language. This product is distributed through our online platform,
 direct sales to businesses and organizations, and we are attempting to develop partnerships with existing video conferencing providers.
 The competitive position is against other video conferencing providers that also offer live interpretation services, such as Microsoft
 Teams, Zoom and Google Meet. We believe our main competitors are organizations that supply human interpreters which can be ten times
 more expensive than our Verbum product. The primary market for our Verbum product is for organizations or individuals that require
 real-time interpretation services. 

Verbum
 SDK . Verbum Software Developer Kit allows software programmers, potential channel partners, and corporate development teams
 to integrate our powerful multilingual communications platform Verbum into new or existing Software-as-a-Service applications
 and/or client/server programs, helping them remove communications barriers for multinational organizations and/or those serving customers
 who speak/read different languages. This product may be distributed through partnerships with software developers or through direct
 sales to businesses and organizations that require interpretation services for their software. The competitive position would be
 against other software development kit providers that also offer interpretation services, such as Microsoft Azure or Amazon Translate.
 The expected market for this product is software developers and businesses that require interpretation services for their software
 applications.

financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are designed at a reasonable assurance level and are effective
to provide reasonable assurance that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act
is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms,
