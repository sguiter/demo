and
working capital was as of September 30, 2024. As of December 31, 2023, cash on hand and working capital was and ,
respectively. The Company generally depends on cash on hand, cash flows from operations, and potential opportunistic sales of property,
plant and equipment PP E to satisfy its liquidity needs. 

The Company believes it will have adequate liquidity
to meet its future operating requirements through a combination of cash on hand, cash expected to be generated from operations, and potential
sales of PP E. However, given the inherent volatility in oil prices and global economic activity, the Company cannot predict this
with certainty. To mitigate this uncertainty, the Company exercises discipline when making capital investments and pursues opportunistic
cost containment initiatives, which can include workforce alignment, limiting overhead spending, and limiting research and development
efforts to only critical items. Additionally, on May 24, 2023, the Company entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement/Security Agreement
(the Factoring Agreement with Zions Bancorporation, N.A., d/b/a Amegy Bank Business Credit Amegy ), which
provides for Koil Energy from time to time to sell its accounts receivable and other rights to payment to Amegy, subject to Amegy s
right to approve or reject future accounts receivable and other rights proposed for sale, in its sole discretion. Any receivables sold
shall bear an interest rate computed as the Wall Street Journal Prime Rate Prime Rate plus 2.00 . The Prime Rate has a
floor and at no time shall it be less than 8.00 for the purposes of this agreement. At September 30, 2024, the Company had outstanding
sales of accounts receivable to Amegy.

Fixed price contracts 

For fixed price contracts, we generally recognize
revenue over time as we perform because of continuous transfer of control to the customer. This continuous transfer of control to the
customer is supported by clauses in the contract that allow the customer to unilaterally terminate the contract for convenience, pay us
for costs incurred plus a reasonable profit and take control of any work in process. In our fixed price contracts, the customer either
controls the work in process or we deliver products with no alternative use to the Company and have rights to payment for work performed
to date plus a reasonable profit as evidenced by contractual termination clauses. 

Because of control transferring over time, revenue
is recognized based on the extent of progress towards completion of the performance obligation. The selection of the method to measure
progress towards completion requires judgment and is based on the nature of the products or services to be provided. We generally use
the cost-to-cost measure of progress for our contracts because it best depicts the transfer of control to the customer which occurs as
we incur costs on our contracts. Under the cost-to-cost measure of progress, the extent of progress towards completion is measured based
on the ratio of costs incurred to date to the total estimated costs at completion of the performance obligation. Revenues, including estimated
fees or profits, are recorded proportionally as costs are incurred. 

Contracts are often modified to account for changes
in contract specifications and requirements. We consider a contract modification to exist when the modification either creates new, or
changes the existing, enforceable rights and obligations. Most of our contract modifications are for goods or services that are not distinct
from the existing contract due to the significant integration service provided in the context of the contract and are accounted for as
if they were part of that existing contract. The effect of a contract modification on the transaction price, and our measure of progress
for the performance obligation to which it relates, is recognized as an adjustment to revenue (either as an increase in or a reduction
of revenue) on a cumulative catch-up basis. 

We have a company-wide standard and disciplined
quarterly estimate at completion process in which management reviews the progress and execution of our performance obligations. As part
of this process, management reviews information including, but not limited to, any outstanding key contract matters, progress towards
completion and the related program schedule, identified risks and opportunities and the related changes in estimates of revenues and costs.
Changes in estimates of net sales, cost of sales and the related impact to operating income are recognized quarterly on a cumulative catch-up
basis, which recognizes in the current period the cumulative effect of the changes on current and prior periods based on a performance
obligation s percentage of completion. A significant change in one or more of these estimates could affect the profitability of
one or more of our performance obligations. When estimates of total costs to be incurred exceed total estimates of revenue to be earned
on a performance obligation related to fixed price contracts, a provision for the entire loss on the performance obligation is recognized
in the period the loss is estimated. 

Service Contracts 

We recognize revenue for service contracts measuring
progress toward satisfying the performance obligation in a manner that best depicts the transfer of goods or services to the customer.
The control over services is transferred over time when the services are rendered to the customer on a daily basis. Specifically, we recognize
revenue as the services are provided as we have the right to invoice the customer for the services performed. Services are billed on a
monthly basis. Payment terms for services are usually 30 days from invoice receipt but can increase to 45, 60, or 90 days depending on
the customer. 

Contract balances 

Costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings
on uncompleted contracts arise when revenues are recorded based on the extent of progress towards completion but cannot be invoiced under
the terms of the contract. Such amounts are invoiced upon completion of contractual milestones. Billings in excess of costs and estimated
earnings on uncompleted contracts arise when milestone billings are permissible under the contract, but the related costs have not yet
been incurred. All contract costs are recognized currently on jobs formally approved by the customer and contracts are not shown as complete
until virtually all anticipated costs have been incurred and the risk of loss has passed to the customer. 

Assets related to costs and estimated earnings
in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts, as well as liabilities related to billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on
uncompleted contracts, have been classified as current. The contract cycle for certain long-term contracts may extend beyond one year;
thus, complete collection of amounts related to these contracts may extend beyond one year though such long-term contracts include contractual
milestone billings as discussed above. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there were no contracts with terms that extended beyond
one year. 

The following table summarizes our contract assets,
which are Costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts and our contract liabilities, which
are Billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts .

The contract asset and liability balances at September
30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 consisted primarily of revenue related to fixed-price projects. 

Remaining Performance Obligations 

Remaining performance obligations represent the
transaction price of firm orders for which work has not been performed and excludes unexercised contract options, potential orders, and
any remaining performance obligations for any sales arrangements that had not fully satisfied the criteria to be considered a contract
with a customer pursuant to the requirements of Accounting Standards Codification 606. 

Practical Expedients and Exemptions 

We generally expense sales commissions when incurred
because the amortization period would have been one year or less. These costs are recorded within selling, general and administrative
expenses. 

Many of our services contracts are short-term
in nature with a contract term of one year or less. For those contracts, we have utilized the practical expedient exempting the Company
from disclosure of the transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations if the performance obligation is part of a contract
that has an original expected duration of one year or less. 

Additionally, our payment terms are short-term
in nature with settlements of one year or less. We have, therefore, utilized the practical expedient exempting the Company from adjusting
the promised amount of consideration for the effects of a significant financing component given that the period between when the entity
transfers a promised good or service to a customer and when the customer pays for that good or service will be one year or less. 

Further, in many of our service contracts, we
have a right to consideration from a customer in an amount that corresponds directly with the value to the customer of our performance
completed to date (for example, a service contract in which we bill a fixed amount for each hour of service provided). For those contracts,
we have utilized the practical expedient allowing us to recognize revenue in the amount for which we have the right to invoice. 

Accordingly, we do not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance
obligations for (i) contracts with an original expected length of one year or less and (ii) contracts for which we recognize revenue at
the amount to which we have the right to invoice for services performed.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL
CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

 (Amounts in thousands except per share amounts) 

The following discussion and analysis provides
information that management believes is relevant for an assessment and understanding of Koil Energy s results of operations and
financial condition. This information should be read in conjunction with the Company s audited historical consolidated financial
statements, which are included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 and which
is available on the SEC s website, and the Company s unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, and notes thereto,
included with this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q Report in Part I. Item 1. Financial Statements. 

General 

Koil Energy is an energy services company that
provides equipment and support services to the world s energy and offshore industries. The Company provides innovative solutions
to complex customer challenges presented between the production facility and the energy source. Koil Energy's core services and technological
solutions include distribution system installation support and engineering services, umbilical terminations, loose-tube steel flying leads,
and related services. Additionally, Koil Energy's experienced professionals can support subsea engineering, manufacturing, installation,
commissioning, and maintenance projects located anywhere in the world. The Company s solutions are engineered and manufactured primarily
for major integrated, large independent, and foreign national energy companies in offshore areas throughout the world. These products
are often developed in direct response to customer requests for solutions to critical needs in the field. The Company primarily serves
the offshore oil and gas market; however, the Company s product offerings and service capabilities are based on core competencies
that are indifferent to energy source and can be applied to additional markets, including offshore wind, offshore wave energy, hydrogen,
and liquefied natural gas. 

Industry and Executive Outlook 

The energy services industry is dependent on the
capital and operating expenditure programs of energy companies. The decision for operators to either advance or cut back their exploration,
drilling, and production operations is largely determined by the overall condition of the energy industry. The oil and gas industry in
particular has historically been characterized by fluctuations in commodity prices, which are driven by a variety of market forces affecting
supply and demand. We believe a convergence of economic, geopolitical, trade, and policy factors has highlighted the issue of years of
underinvestment in upstream offshore hydrocarbon production and appears to have driven operators to focus on optimizing production volumes.
Per the International Energy Agency s October 2024 Oil Market Report, the global demand for oil is expected to increase by approximately
nine hundred thousand barrels per day in 2024 and close to one million barrels per day in 2025. As a result, we anticipate global offshore
oil production to continue playing a pivotal role in meeting the world s energy demands in the near term.

The 27 increase in revenues was primarily driven
by an increase in fixed price contracts for the manufacture of subsea distribution equipment, such as flying leads and hydraulic distribution
manifolds, partially offset by a decline in service contract activity when compared to revenues for the three months ended September
30, 2023.

Adjusted EBITDA 

Management evaluates Company performance based
on a measure that is not in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America US GAAP ),
which consists of earnings (net income or loss) available to common stockholders before net interest income, income taxes, depreciation
and amortization, non-cash share-based compensation expense, non-cash impairments, non-cash gains or losses on the sale of property, plant
and equipment PP E ), other non-cash items and one-time charges Adjusted EBITDA ). This measure may not
be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies. The measure should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute
for operating income or loss, net income or loss, cash flows provided by operating, investing, or financing activities, or other cash
flow data prepared in accordance with US GAAP. The amounts included in the Adjusted EBITDA calculation, however, are derived from amounts
included in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations. 

15 

We believe Adjusted EBITDA is a useful measure
of a company s operating performance, which can vary substantially from company to company depending upon accounting methods and
book value of assets, financing methods, capital structure and the method by which assets were acquired. It helps investors more meaningfully
evaluate and compare the results of our operations from period to period by removing the impact of our capital structure (primarily interest),
asset base (primarily depreciation and amortization), and actions that do not affect liquidity (share-based compensation expense) from
our operating results. Additionally, it helps investors identify items that are within our operational control. Depreciation and amortization
charges, while a component of operating income, are fixed at the time of the asset purchase or acquisition in accordance with the depreciable
lives of the related asset and as such are not a directly controllable period operating charge. 

The following is a reconciliation of net income
(loss) to Adjusted EBITDA for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:

The 658 increase in Adjusted EBITDA was primarily
driven by gross profit improvement associated with the increase in fixed price contracts during the three months ended September 30, 2024
as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

As an offshore energy services provider, our revenues,
profitability, cash flows, and future rate of growth are generally dependent on the condition of the global oil and gas industry and our
customers ability to invest capital for offshore exploration, drilling and production, and maintenance of offshore drilling and
production facilities. Oil and gas prices and the level of offshore drilling and production activity have historically been characterized
by significant volatility. At times, we enter into large, fixed-price contracts which may require significant lead time and investment.
A decline in offshore drilling and production activity could result in lower contract volume or delays in significant contracts, which
could negatively impact our earnings and cash flows. Our earnings and cash flows could also be negatively affected by delays in payments
by significant customers or delays in the completion of our contracts for any reason. 

The Company believes it will have adequate liquidity
to meet its future operating requirements. We are generally dependent on our cash flows from operations to fund our working capital requirements,
and the uncertainties noted above create risks that we may not achieve our planned earnings or cash flow from operations. In 2023, the
Company entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement/Security Agreement with Zions Bancorporation, N.A., d/b/a Amegy Bank Business Credit Amegy ), which provides for Koil Energy from time to time to sell its accounts receivable and other rights to payment to
Amegy, subject to Amegy s right to approve or reject future accounts receivable and other rights proposed for sale, in its sole
discretion. At September 30, 2024, the Company had no outstanding sales of accounts receivable to Amegy. 

The principal liquidity needs of the Company are
to fund ongoing operations, working capital, and capital expenditures. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company reported
a 1,090 increase in cash. The Company generated 1,171 in net cash in operating activities, primarily driven by income of 2,083 and
other adjustments of 578 to reconcile net income to net cash provided by operating activities, which includes items such as share-based
compensation, depreciation and amortization, loss on sale of PP E, and non-cash lease expense. This was partially offset by changes
in operating assets and liabilities of 1,490. The Company used 127 of net cash for investing activities, primarily to fund capital expenditures.
The Company also generated 46 of net cash from financing activities, primarily driven by proceeds received from the exercise of stock
options. 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2023,
the Company reported a 1,221 decrease in cash. The Company used 733 of net cash in operating activities, primarily driven by changes
in operating assets and liabilities of 383 and a net loss of 673. This was partially offset by other adjustments to reconcile net loss
to net cash used in operating activities of 323, which includes items such as share-based compensation, depreciation and amortization,
gain on sale of PP E, bad debt expense, and non-cash lease benefit. The Company used 228 of net cash for investing activities, primarily
to fund capital expenditures. The Company also used 260 of net cash in financing activities for principal payments made under its finance
lease obligations. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

The Company has no off-balance sheet arrangements
that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on its financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues
or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors. 

Critical Accounting Estimates 

The preparation of financial statements in conformity
with US GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure
of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. The most significant estimates used in the financial statements relate to revenue recognition where the Company measures
progress towards completion on a cost-to-cost basis for fixed-price contracts, the allowance for doubtful accounts, and the valuation
allowance for deferred income tax assets. These estimates require judgments, which are based on historical experience and on various other
assumptions, as well as specific circumstances. Estimates may change as new events occur, additional information becomes available or
operating environments change. 

18 

Refer to Part II. Item 7. Management s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2023 for a discussion of our critical accounting policies and estimates. 

Allowance for Credit Losses 

The estimation of anticipated credit losses that
may be incurred as we work through the invoice collection process with our customers requires us to make judgments and estimates regarding
our customers ability to pay amounts due. We monitor our customers payment history and current credit worthiness, if needed,
to determine that collectability is reasonably assured. We provide an allowance for credit losses based by reviewing each accounts receivable
balance with respect to a debtor s ability to make payments. We also evaluate historical loss rates as well as consider forward-looking
factors specific to the debtors, the overall economic environment, and management expectations to determine expected losses. When certain
accounts are determined to require an allowance, they are expensed by a provision for bad debts in that period. At September 30, 2024
and 2023, we estimated the allowance for credit losses requirement to be zero. There were no charges to bad debt expense for the three
and nine months ended September 30, 2024. The Company recorded no charges and a 1 charge to bad debt expense during the three and nine
months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. We believe that no allowance for credit losses is necessary under current conditions; however,
uncertainties regarding changes in the financial condition of our customers could impact the amount and timing of any additional credit
losses that may be required. 

Recently Issued Accounting Standards 

Refer to Note 1 in Part II. Item 8. Financial Statements and
Supplemental Data, in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 for a discussion of recently issued accounting
standards. 

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 

Not Applicable 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

The Company s disclosure controls and procedures
are designed to ensure that such information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports filed or submitted under the Exchange
Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. The Company s
disclosure controls and procedures are also designed to ensure that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including
the principal executive and the principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.
There are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system of disclosure controls and procedures, including the possibility of
human error and the circumvention or overriding of controls and procedures. Accordingly, even effective disclosure controls and procedures
can only provide reasonable assurance that control objectives are attained. The Company s disclosure controls and procedures are
designed to provide such reasonable assurance. 

The Company s management, with the participation
of the principal executive and principal financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s
disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024, as required by Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act. Based on that evaluation,
the principal executive and the principal financial officer have concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures
were effective as of September 30, 2024. 

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting 

The Company s management, with the participation
of the principal executive and principal financial officer, have concluded there were no changes in internal control over financial reporting
during the nine months ended September 30, 2024.
