From time to time, we have reclassified certain securities from available for sale to held to maturity. Such transfers are made at fair value at the date of transfer. The unrealized holding gains and losses at the date of transfer are retained in accumulated other comprehensive loss and in the carrying value of the held to maturity securities and are amortized or accreted over the remaining life of the security. These unamortized unrealized losses and unaccreted unrealized gains on our transferred securities are included in accumulated other comprehensive loss on our balance sheet and they netted to an unrealized loss of at September 30, 2024 compared to an unrealized loss of at December 31, 2023. This amount will continue to be amortized and accreted out of accumulated other comprehensive loss over the remaining life of the underlying securities as an adjustment of the yield on those securities.

There were investments in an unrealized loss position at September 30, 2024, of which were available for sale debt securities in an unrealized loss position with no recorded allowance for credit losses. The available for sale securities in a loss position included treasury securities, corporate bonds, mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations. Management evaluates available for sale debt securities in an unrealized loss position to determine whether the impairment is due to credit-related factors or noncredit-related factors. With respect to the collateralized mortgage obligations and mortgage-backed securities issued by the U.S. government and its agencies, the Company has determined that the decline in fair value is not due to credit-related factors. The Company monitors the credit quality of other debt securities through the use of credit ratings and other factors specific to an individual security in assessing whether or not the decline in fair value of municipal or corporate securities, relative to their amortized cost, is due to credit-related factors. Triggers to prompt further investigation of securities when the fair value is less than the amortized cost are when a security has been downgraded and falls below an A credit rating, and the security s unrealized loss exceeds of its book value. Consideration is given to (1) the extent to which fair value is less than cost, (2) the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer, and (3) the intent and ability of the Company to retain its investment in the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value. Based on evaluation of available evidence, management believes the unrealized losses on the securities as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 are not credit-related. Management does not have the intent to sell any of these securities and believes that it is more likely than not the Company will not have to sell any such securities before recovery of cost. The fair values are expected to recover as the securities approach their maturity date or repricing date or if market yields for the investments decline. Accordingly, no allowance for credit losses has been recorded for these securities. Management assesses held to maturity securities sharing similar risk characteristics on a collective basis for expected credit losses under the current expected credit losses ("CECL") methodology. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , our held to maturity securities consisted of U.S. government agencies, municipal bonds, treasury securities, collateralized mortgage obligations and mortgage-backed securities issued by the U.S. government and its agencies. With regard to the treasuries, collateralized mortgage obligations and mortgage-backed securities issued by the U.S. government, or agencies thereof, it is expected that the securities will not be settled at prices less than the amortized cost bases of the securities as such securities are backed by the full faith and credit of and/or guaranteed by the U.S. government. Mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations are backed by pools of mortgages that are insured or guaranteed by the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, the Federal National Mortgage Association or the government National Mortgage Association. For municipal securities, management reviewed key risk indicators, including ratings by credit agencies when available, and determined that there is no current expectation of credit loss. Accordingly, there is allowance for credit losses recorded for our available for sale or held to maturity debt securities as of September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023.

 during the third quarter of 2024, and million and during the second and first quarters of 2024, respectively. Our gross loan balances decreased by million during the third quarter and by million year to date, while overall credit quality trends and economic forecast assumptions remained relatively stable. The Company uses the weighted-average remaining maturity ("WARM") method as the basis for the estimation of expected credit losses. The WARM method uses a historical average annual charge-off rate containing loss content over a historical lookback period and is used as a foundation for estimating the credit loss reserve for the remaining outstanding balances of loans in a segment at the balance sheet date. The average annual charge-off rate is applied to the contractual term, further adjusted for estimated prepayments, to determine the unadjusted historical charge-off rate. The calculation of the unadjusted historical charge-off rate is then adjusted, using qualitative factors, for current conditions and for reasonable and supportable forecast periods. Qualitative loss factors are based on the Company s judgment of company, market, industry or business specific data, differences in loan-specific risk characteristics such as underwriting standards, portfolio mix, risk grades, delinquency level, or term. These qualitative factors serve to compensate for additional areas of uncertainty inherent in the portfolio that are not reflected in our historic loss factors. Additionally, we have adjusted for changes in expected environmental and economic conditions, such as changes in unemployment rates, property values, and other relevant factors over the next 12 to 24 months. Management adjusted the historical loss experience for these expectations. No reversion adjustments were necessary, as the starting point for the Company s estimate was a cumulative loss rate covering the expected contractual term of the portfolio. The ACL is measured on a collective segment basis when similar risk characteristics exist. Our loan portfolio is segmented first by regulatory call report code, and second, by internally identified risk grades for our commercial loan segments and by delinquency status for our consumer loan segments. We also have separate segments for our internally originated SBA loans and for our SBA loans acquired from Westbound Bank. Consistent forecasts of the loss drivers are used across the loan segments. For loans that do not share general risk characteristics with segments, we estimate a specific reserve on an individual basis. A reserve is recorded when the carrying amount of the loan exceeds the discounted estimated cash flows using the loan's initial effective interest rate or the fair value of collateral for collateral-dependent loans. Assets are graded pass when the relationship exhibits acceptable credit risk and indicates repayment ability, tolerable collateral coverage and reasonable performance history. Lending relationships exhibiting potentially significant credit risk and marginal repayment ability and/or asset protection are graded special mention. Assets classified as substandard are inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. Loans so classified must have a well-defined weakness that jeopardizes the liquidation of the debt. Substandard graded loans are characterized by the distinct possibility that the Company will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. Assets graded doubtful are substandard graded loans that have added characteristics that make collection or liquidation in full improbable. Loans that are on nonaccrual status are generally classified as substandard. In general, the loans in our portfolio have low historical credit losses. The Company closely monitors economic conditions and loan performance trends to manage and evaluate the exposure to credit risk. Key factors tracked by the Company and utilized in evaluating the credit quality of the loan portfolio include trends in delinquency ratios, the level of nonperforming assets, borrower s repayment capacity, and collateral coverage.

DCB Trust I Debentures 

Subordinated note 

Other debentures 

As of September 30, 2024 , the Company has two active trusts, Guaranty (TX) Capital Trust III Trust III and DCB Financial Trust I DCB Trust I and together with Trust III, the "Trusts"). Upon formation, the Trusts issued trust preferred securities TruPS with a liquidation value of per share to third parties in private placements. Concurrently with the issuance of the TruPS, the Trusts issued common securities to the Company. The Trusts invested the proceeds of the sales of their securities in junior subordinated debentures issued by the Company Debentures ). The Debentures mature approximately after the issuance date, which may be shortened if certain conditions are met (including the Company having received prior approval of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the "Federal Reserve") and any other required regulatory approvals). 

Original liquidation value 

Common securities liquidation value 

The securities held by the Trusts qualify as Tier 1 capital for the Company under Federal Reserve Board guidelines. The Federal Reserve s guidelines restrict core capital elements (including trust preferred securities and qualifying perpetual preferred stock) to 25 of all core capital elements, net of goodwill less any associated deferred tax liability. Because the Company s aggregate amount of trust preferred securities is less than the limit of 25 of Tier 1 capital, net of goodwill, the full amount is includable in Tier 1 capital at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Additionally, the terms provide that trust preferred securities would no longer qualify for Tier 1 capital within five years of their maturity, but would be included as Tier 2 capital. However, the trust preferred securities would be amortized out of Tier 2 capital by one-fifth each year and excluded from Tier 2 capital completely during the year prior to maturity of the Debentures. With certain exceptions, the amount of the principal and any accrued and unpaid interest on the Debentures are subordinated in right of payment to the prior payment in full of all senior indebtedness of the Company. Interest on the Debentures is payable quarterly. The interest is deferrable on a cumulative basis for up to five consecutive years following a suspension of dividend payments on all other capital stock. No principal payments are due until maturity for each of the Debentures. 

Maturity date

In accordance with ASC 810, " Consolidation, " the Debentures issued by the Company to the Trusts are shown as liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets and interest expense associated with the Debentures is shown in the consolidated statements of earnings.

On any interest payment date on or after October 1, 2016 and prior to maturity date, the Debentures are redeemable for cash at the option of the Company, on at least , but not more than notice, in whole or in part, at a redemption price equal to of the principal amount to be redeemed, plus accrued interest to the date of redemption. DCB Trust I Debentures Interest is payable at a variable rate per annum, reset quarterly, equal to 3-month SOFR plus . On any interest payment date on or after June 15, 2012 and prior to maturity date, the Debentures are redeemable for cash at the option of the Company, on at least , but not more than notice, in whole or in part, at a redemption price equal to of the principal amount to be redeemed, plus accrued interest to the date of redemption. Subordinated Note In March 2022, the Company completed a private placement of aggregate principal amount of its fixed-to-floating rate subordinated note due April 1, 2032. The subordinated note initially bears a fixed interest rate of per year, due semi-annually in arrears on April 1 and October 1. Commencing on April 1, 2027, the interest rate on the subordinated note will reset each quarter at a floating interest rate equal to the then-current three-month term SOFR plus 192 basis points. The Company may at its option redeem in whole or in part the subordinated note on or after March 4, 2027 without a premium. The subordinated note is treated as Tier 2 capital for regulatory purposes (subject to reductions in the amount includable as Tier 2 capital in the final five years prior to maturity), and is presented net of related unamortized issuance costs on the consolidated balance sheets. Other Debentures In May 2020, the Company issued in debentures to directors and other related parties. The debentures were issued at a par value of each with fixed annual rates between and and maturity dates between and . Various of these debentures have matured since issuance and remains outstanding as of September 30, 2024 . At the Company s option, and with advanced notice to the holder, the entire principal amount and all accrued interest may be paid to the holder on or before the maturity date of any debenture.

 grace period for vested options. The fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using a closed form option valuation (Black-Scholes) model that uses the assumptions noted in the table below. Expected volatilities are based on historical volatilities of the Company s common stock and similar peer group averages. The Company uses historical data to estimate option exercise and post-vesting termination behavior. The expected term of options granted is based on historical data and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding, which takes in to account that the options are not transferable. The dividend yield is the total dividends per share paid during the period divided by the average of the Company's stock price on each date a grant was issued. The risk-free interest rate for the expected term of the option is based on U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of the grant.

 recorded ACL with respect to these commitments as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Letters of credit are written conditional commitments issued by the Company to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. The Company s policies generally require that letters of credit arrangements contain security and debt covenants similar to those contained in loan agreements. In the event the customer does not perform in accordance with the terms of the agreement with the third party, the Company would be required to fund the commitment. The maximum potential amount of future payments the Company could be required to make is represented by the contractual amount shown in the table below. If the commitment were funded, the Company would be entitled to seek recovery from the customer. Our credit risk associated with issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as the risk involved in extending loan facilities to our customers. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , amounts have been recorded as an ACL for the Bank s potential obligations under these guarantees. 

Letters of credit 

Litigation The Company is involved in certain claims and lawsuits occurring in the normal course of business. Management, after consultation with legal counsel, does not believe that the outcome of these actions, if determined adversely, would have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements of the Company. FHLB Letters of Credit At September 30, 2024, the Company had letters of credit of pledged to secure public deposits, repurchase agreements, and for other purposes required or permitted by law.

 above minimum risk-based capital requirements, below which an institution would be subject to limitations on certain activities including payment of dividends, share repurchases and discretionary bonuses to executive officers. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company s capital ratios exceeded those levels necessary to be categorized as well capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action. To be categorized as well capitalized , the Company must maintain minimum capital ratios as set forth in the table. There are no conditions or events since September 30, 2024 that management believes have changed the Company s category. The Federal Reserve s guidelines regarding the capital treatment of trust preferred securities limits restricted core capital elements (including trust preferred securities and qualifying perpetual preferred stock) to 25 of all core capital elements, net of goodwill less any associated deferred tax liability. Because the Company s aggregate amount of trust preferred securities is less than the limit of 25 of Tier 1 capital, net of goodwill, the rules permit the inclusion of of trust preferred securities in Tier 1 capital as of both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Additionally, the rules provide that trust preferred securities would no longer qualify for Tier 1 capital within five years of their maturity, but would be included as Tier 2 capital. However, the trust preferred securities would be amortized out of Tier 2 capital by one-fifth each year and excluded from Tier 2 capital completely during the year prior to maturity of the Debentures.

Dividends paid by Guaranty are mainly provided by dividends from its subsidiaries. However, certain regulatory restrictions exist regarding the ability of its bank subsidiary to transfer funds to Guaranty in the form of cash dividends, loans or advances. The amount of dividends that a subsidiary bank organized as a national banking association, such as the Bank, may declare in a calendar year is the subsidiary bank s net profits for that year combined with its retained net profits for the preceding two years. Retained net profits, as defined by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, consist of net income less dividends declared during the period.

The methods and assumptions, not previously presented, used to estimate fair values are described as follows: Cash and Cash Equivalents : The carrying amounts of cash and short-term instruments approximate fair values (Level 1). Marketable Securities Held to Maturity : The fair values for marketable securities held to maturity are determined by quoted market prices, if available (Level 1). For securities where quoted prices are not available, fair values are calculated based on market prices of similar securities (Level 2). Loans, net : The fair value of fixed-rate loans and variable-rate loans that reprice on an infrequent basis is estimated by discounting future cash flows using the current interest rates at which similar loans with similar terms would be made to borrowers of similar credit quality (Level 3). Nonmarketable Equity Securities : It is not practical to determine the fair value of Independent Bankers Financial Corporation, Federal Home Loan Bank, Federal Reserve Bank and other stock due to restrictions placed on its transferability. Deposits and Securities Sold Under Repurchase Agreements : The fair values disclosed for demand deposits (e.g., interest and non-interest checking, passbook savings, and certain types of money market accounts) are, by definition, equal to the amount payable on demand at the reporting date (i.e., their carrying amount) (Level 1). The fair values of deposit liabilities with defined maturities are estimated by discounting future cash flows using interest rates currently offered for deposits of similar remaining maturities (Level 2).

Diluted earnings per share reflects the maximum potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock and would then share in the net earnings of the Company. Dilutive share equivalents include stock-based awards issued to employees. Stock options granted by the Company are treated as potential shares in computing diluted earnings per share. Diluted shares outstanding include the dilutive effect of in-the-money awards which is calculated based on the average share price for each fiscal period using the treasury stock method. Under the treasury stock method, the amount that the employee must pay for exercising stock options, the amount of compensation cost for future service that the Company has not yet recognized, and the amount of tax impact that would be recorded in additional paid-in capital when the award becomes deductible are assumed to be used to repurchase shares.

References in this Report to Guaranty Bank Trust and the Bank refer to Guaranty Bank Trust, N.A., a national banking association and our wholly-owned consolidated subsidiary. 
 General 
 We were incorporated in 1990 to serve as the holding company for Guaranty Bank Trust. Since our founding, we have built a reputation based on financial stability and community leadership. In May 2017, we consummated an initial public offering of our common stock, which began trading on the Nasdaq Global Select Market until March 7, 2023, at which time our listing was transferred to the New York Stock Exchange, where our common stock continues to trade under the symbol "GNTY". 
 We currently operate 33 banking locations in the East Texas, Dallas/Fort Worth, Houston and Central Texas regions of the state. Our principal executive office is located at 16475 Dallas Parkway, Suite 600, Addison, Texas, 75001 and our telephone number is (888) 572-9881. Our website address is www.gnty.com . Information contained on our website does not constitute a part of this Report and is not incorporated by reference into this filing or any other report. 
 As a bank holding company that operates through one segment, we generate most of our revenue from interest on loans and investments, customer service and loan fees, fees related to the sale of mortgage loans, and trust and wealth management services. We incur interest expense on deposits and other borrowed funds, as well as noninterest expense, such as salaries and employee benefits and occupancy expenses. We analyze our ability to maximize income generated from interest-earning assets and control the interest expenses of our liabilities, measured as net interest income, through our net interest margin and net interest spread. Net interest income is the difference between interest income on interest-earning assets, such as loans and securities, and interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings, which are used to fund those assets. Net interest margin is a ratio calculated as net interest income divided by average interest-earning assets. Net interest spread is the difference between rates earned on interest-earning assets and rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities. 
 Changes in market interest rates and the interest rates we earn on interest-earning assets or pay on interest-bearing liabilities, as well as in the volume and types of interest-earning assets, interest-bearing and noninterest-bearing liabilities and shareholders' equity, are usually the largest drivers of periodic changes in net interest spread, net interest margin and net interest income. Fluctuations in market interest rates are driven by many factors, including governmental monetary policies, inflation, deflation, macroeconomic developments, changes in unemployment, the money supply, political and international conditions and conditions in domestic and foreign financial markets. Periodic changes in the volume and types of loans in our loan portfolio are affected by, among other factors, economic and competitive conditions in Texas, as well as developments affecting the real estate, technology, financial services, insurance, transportation, manufacturing and energy sectors within our target markets and throughout the State of Texas. 
 QUARTERLY HIGHLIGHTS 
 Improvement in NIM and Stable Earnings. Net interest margin, on a fully taxable equivalent basis, continued to improve in the third quarter, increasing to 3.33 , compared to 3.26 in the second quarter and 3.02 in the prior year quarter. Earnings were fairly consistent with the prior quarter, showing improvements in net interest income, noninterest income and employee and compensation expenses, which were slightly offset by a lower reverse provision for credit losses and higher provision for income taxes in the third quarter. The net interest income improvements resulted primarily from a decrease in interest bearing liability costs, while earning assets have continued to reprice upward. 

Solid Balance Sheet, Capital and Liquidity. During the past year, we have strategically shrunk our balance sheet primarily by paying off debt and allowing transactional/non-relationship loans to pay off. This strategy positions us to be on the offense when we believe strong opportunities for growth or M A are presented. Our capital and liquidity ratios, as well as contingent liquidity sources, remain very healthy. During the third quarter of 2024, we repurchased 

(Continued) 36 . 

59,996 shares of our common stock, or 0.53 of our average shares outstanding during the period, at an average price of 30.65 per share. Our liquidity ratio, calculated as cash and cash equivalents and unpledged investments divided by total liabilities, was 17.1 as of September 30, 2024, compared to 14.0 as of September 30, 2023. Our total available contingent liquidity, net of current outstanding borrowings, was 1.4 billion, consisting of FHLB, FRB and correspondent bank fed funds and revolving lines of credit. Finally, our total equity to average quarterly assets as of September 30, 2024 was 10.4 . If we had to recognize our entire net unrealized losses on both AFS and HTM securities, our total equity to average assets ratio would be 9.8 , which we believe represents a strong capital level under regulatory requirements. 

Good Asset Quality. Overall credit quality remains strong and the expected losses on deteriorating credits are low due to the Bank's equity position and/or strong guarantor support. Nonperforming assets as a percentage of total assets were 0.66 at September 30, 2024, compared to 0.71 at June 30, 2024 and 0.09 at September 30, 2023. Net charge-offs (annualized) to average loans were 0.04 for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to 0.01 for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, and 0.11 for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. 

There was a reverse provision to the allowance for credit losses of 500,000 during the third quarter, in addition to the 1.45 million reverse provision during the first half of the year. Changes to historical and qualitative factors have been minimal during the first three quarters of 2024, therefore the decrease in the allowance for credit losses was due primarily to the decreases in outstanding loan balances of 186.0 million, or 8.0 , since January 1, 2024, which were partially offset by an increase in special mention loans during the same period as we continue to work with a relatively small number of stressed borrowers. 
 Nonperforming assets consist of both nonaccrual loans and other real estate owned (ORE). Nonaccrual loans represented 0.24 of total outstanding loan balances as of September 30, 2024 and consisted primarily of smaller dollar consumer and small business loans. ORE consisted of two real estate properties, both of which we expect to resolve and sell in the fourth quarter of 2024 with minimal, if any, losses. Nonaccrual loans represented 0.28 and 0.12 of total outstanding loan balances as of June 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. 
 Granular and Consistent Core Deposit Base. As of September 30, 2024, we have 89,878 total deposit accounts with an average account balance of 29,695. We have a historically reliable core deposit base, with strong and trusted banking relationships. Total deposits increased by 42.8 million during the third quarter. DDA and time deposit balances increased 19.2 million and 24.5 million, respectively, while savings and MMDA balances decreased 965,000 during the third quarter of 2024. Excluding public funds and Bank-owned accounts, our uninsured deposits as of September 30, 2024 were 26.3 of total deposits. 

Interest rates paid on deposits during the quarter stabilized with minimal increases. Noninterest-bearing deposits represent 31.5 of total deposits as of September 30, 2024. Our cost of interest-bearing deposits increased one basis point during the quarter from 3.32 in the prior quarter to 3.33 . This increase was primarily due to renewals of maturing certificates of deposit into new CDs paying higher rates, although current CD rate offerings were recently lowered late in the quarter. Our cost of total deposits for the third quarter of 2024 increased three basis points from 2.28 in the prior quarter to 2.31 . 
 Non-GAAP financial metric. Calculations of this metric and reconciliations to GAAP are included in subsequent sections of this MD A.

(1) Net interest margin is equal to net interest income divided by average interest-earning assets. 

(2) Net interest rate spread is the average yield on interest-earning assets minus the average rate on interest-bearing liabilities. 

Net Interest Income 
 Our operating results depend primarily on our net interest income. Fluctuations in market interest rates impact the yield and rates paid on interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, respectively. Changes in the amount and type of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities also impact our net interest income. To evaluate net interest income, we measure and monitor (1) yields on our loans and other interest-earning assets, (2) the costs of our deposits and other funding sources, (3) our net interest spread and (4) our net interest margin. Because noninterest-bearing sources of funds, such as noninterest-bearing deposits and shareholders equity also fund interest-earning assets, net interest margin includes the benefit of these noninterest-bearing sources. 
 Net interest income, before the provision for credit losses, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 71.7 million and 73.2 million, respectively, a decrease of 1.5 million, or 2.1 . The decrease in net interest income resulted primarily from an increase in interest expense of 7.7 million, or 18.1 , partially offset by a 6.2 million, or 5.4 , increase in interest income. 
 The 7.7 million increase in interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily related to a 13.9 million, or 45.2 , increase in interest on deposits, despite a 133.8 million, or 8.0 , increase in average interest-bearing deposits. The increase in deposit-related interest expense was due to a 84 basis point increase in average rate paid on these deposits, compared to the same period in 2023. That increase was partially offset by a 6.3 million decrease in interest paid on FHLB advances. 
 The increase in interest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily related to an increase in interest income on loans of 4.6 million, or 4.6 , and a 1.5 million, or 12.3 , increase in interest earned on securities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net interest margin on a fully taxable equivalent basis and net interest spread were 3.25 and 2.17 , respectively, compared to 3.16 and 2.17 for the same period in 2023, which reflects a 55 basis point increase in the yield on interest-earning assets, assisted by a 160.9 million, or 5.2 , decrease in average interest-earning assets during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period of the prior year. The increase in the yield on interest-earning assets was partially offset by a 55 basis point increase in the rate on interest-bearing liabilities from the same period of the prior year. 
 Average Balance Sheet Amounts, Interest Earned and Yield Analysis 
 The following table presents an analysis of net interest income and net interest spread for the periods indicated, including average outstanding balances for all major categories of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, the interest earned or paid on such amounts, and the average rates earned or paid on such assets or liabilities, respectively. The table also sets forth the net interest margin on average total interest-earning assets for the same periods. Interest earned on loans that are classified as nonaccrual is not recognized in income; however, the balances are reflected in average outstanding balances for the period. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the amount of

interest income not recognized on nonaccrual loans was not material. Any nonaccrual loans have been included in the table as loans carrying a zero yield.

Provision for Credit Losses 
 The provision for credit losses is a charge to income in order to bring our allowance for credit losses to a level deemed appropriate by management based on factors such as historical loss experience, trends in classified and past due loans, volume and growth in the loan portfolio, current economic conditions in our markets and value of the underlying collateral. Loans are charged off against the allowance for credit losses when determined appropriate. Although management believes it uses the best information available to make determinations with respect to the provision for credit losses, future adjustments may be necessary if economic conditions differ from the assumptions used in making the determination. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded a 2.0 million reversal of the provision for credit losses, compared to no provision recorded during the same period in 2023. Our gross loan balances decreased by 78.5 million during the third quarter and by 186.0 million during the first nine months of 2024, while overall credit quality trends and economic forecast assumptions remained relatively stable. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, our allowance for credit losses as a percentage of total loans was 1.34 and 1.33 , respectively. 
 As of September 30, 2024, there were 9.6 million in loan balances past due 30 or more days, including 2.7 million in loan balances for nonperforming (nonaccrual) loans, compared to 9.8 million and 4.2 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2023, and 23.0 million and 1.6 million, respectively, as of September 30, 2023. 
 Noninterest Income 
 Our primary sources of recurring noninterest income are service charges on deposit accounts, merchant and debit card fees, fiduciary income, gains on the sale of both mortgage and SBA loans, and income from bank-owned life insurance . Noninterest income does not include loan origination fees to the extent they exceed the direct loan origination costs, which are generally recognized over the life of the related loan as an adjustment to yield using the interest method.

Total noninterest income decreased 2.7 million, or 15.3 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023. Material changes in the components of noninterest income are discussed below. 
 Service Charges. We earn fees from our customers for deposit-related services, and these fees typically constitute a significant and generally predictable component of our noninterest income. We recorded a 68,000, or 2.1 , increase, which was primarily the result of growth in the number of DDAs and debit card usage volume during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The total number of DDAs increased by 1,348 accounts, from 55,999 as of September 30, 2023 to 57,347 as of September 30, 2024. 
 Net Realized Loss on Securities Transactions . We sell securities from time-to-time, which results in gains or losses being recognized in the income statement as noninterest income. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023 we sold securities for a net loss of 229,000. No securities were sold during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Gain on Sale of Loans . We originate long-term fixed-rate mortgage loans and Small Business Administration (SBA) loans for resale into the secondary market. We sold 103 mortgage loans for 23.7 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 130 mortgage loans for 34.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, which is consistent with the industry-wide decline in overall mortgage volumes attributable to increased mortgage loan rates. Gain on sale of loans was 751,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 254,000, or 25.3 , compared to 1.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The gain reported in the current period was attributable to the gain on sale of mortgage loans of 598,000 and gain on SBA 7(a) loan sales of 153,000, while the gain during the same period in the prior year consisted of 844,000 in mortgage loan sales and 162,000 in SBA 7(a) loan sales. 
 Fiduciary and Custodial Income. We have trust powers and provide fiduciary and custodial services through our trust and wealth management division. We recorded a 57,000, or 3.0 , decrease in income related to these services, which was primarily due to the opening of 26 new trust accounts during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 32 opened during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Furthermore, revenue for our services fluctuates by month with the market value for all publicly traded assets, which are primarily held in irrevocable trusts and investment management accounts that carry higher fees. Additionally, our custody-only assets are carried in a tiered percentage rate fee schedule charged against market value. 
 Bank-Owned Life Insurance Income. We invest in bank-owned life insurance due to its attractive nontaxable return and protection against the loss of our key employees. We record income based on the growth of the cash surrender value of these policies as well as the annual yield net of fees and charges, including mortality charges. Income from bank-owned life insurance increased 64,000, or 9.2 , during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in income was primarily due to an increase in yield crediting rates for certain carriers. 
 Merchant and Debit Card Fees. We earn interchange income related to the activity of our customers merchant debit card usage. We recorded a 98,000, or 1.8 , increase during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to growth in the number of DDAs and debit card usage volume during 2024. The total number of DDAs increased by 1,348 accounts, from 55,999 as of September 30, 2023 to 57,347 as of September 30, 2024. 
 (Continued) 41 . 

Loan Processing Fee Income. We recorded a 48,000, or 11.9 , decrease in loan processing fee income during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023. The decrease in loan processing fee income was primarily attributable to a decrease in the volume of newly originated, renewed or extended loans during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Mortgage Fee Income. Mortgage fee income consists of lender processing fees such as underwriting fees, administrative fees and funding fees that are collected from mortgage loans that the Bank intends to sell on the secondary market. The decrease of 34,000, or 20.7 , from September 30, 2023 was primarily due to a lower volume of mortgage purchases and refinances during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Other Noninterest Income. This category includes a variety of other income producing activities, including loan origination fees, wire transfer fees, loan administration fees, and other fee income. Other noninterest income decreased 2.8 million, or 55.8 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to a one-time gain on the sale of nonmarketable correspondent bank stock of 2.8 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Noninterest Expense 
 Generally, noninterest expense is composed of all employee expenses and costs associated with operating our facilities, obtaining and retaining customer relationships and providing bank services. The largest component of noninterest expense is salaries and employee benefits. Noninterest expense also includes operational expenses, such as occupancy expenses, depreciation and amortization of our facilities and our furniture, fixtures and office equipment, professional and regulatory fees, including FDIC assessments, data processing expenses, and advertising and promotion expenses. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, noninterest expense totaled 62.0 million, an increase of 1.0 million, or 1.7 , compared to 61.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The following table presents, for the periods indicated, the major categories of noninterest expense:

Material changes in the components of noninterest expense are discussed below. 
 Employee Compensation and Benefits. Salaries and employee benefits are the largest component of noninterest expense and include payroll expense, the cost of incentive compensation, benefit plans, health insurance and payroll taxes. We recorded a 401,000, or 1.1 , decrease in employee compensation and benefits, which was primarily related to a 483,000 decrease in bonus expense, which is tied to earnings, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023. 
 Occupancy Expenses. Occupancy expenses are mainly composed of depreciation expense on fixed assets and lease expense related to ASC 842 accounting. We recorded a 153,000, or 1.8 , increase during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to an increase in common area and building maintenance costs incurred on leased properties during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Legal and Professional Fees. Legal and professional fees, which include audit, loan review and regulatory assessments other than FDIC insurance assessment fees, decreased 82,000, or 3.3 , compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to a decrease in professional fees paid for the recruitment of additional officers during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 (Continued) 42 . 

Software and Technology. Software and technology expenses increased 527,000, or 11.9 , from 4.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 4.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The increase is attributable primarily to additional technology investments during the current year. 
 Advertising and Promotions. Advertising and promotion-related expenses were 616,000 and 824,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, a decrease of 208,000, or 25.2 . The decrease was primarily due to decreased advertising and vendor costs in the current period compared to the same period in the prior year. 
 FDIC Insurance Assessment Fees. FDIC insurance assessment fees were 1.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 1.2 million for the same period in 2023. The decrease of 102,000, or 8.6 , was primarily due to a decrease in the insurance assessment rate resulting from changes in certain financial ratios used in the calculation and an overall decrease in our assessment base, which is calculated as average total assets less average tangible equity. 
 Other Noninterest Expense . This category includes operating and administrative expenses, such as stock option expense, expenses related to repossession of assets, small hardware and software purchases, expense of the value of stock appreciation rights, losses incurred on problem assets, losses on sale of other real estate owned and other assets, other real estate owned expense and write-downs, business development expenses (i.e., travel and entertainment, charitable contributions and club memberships), insurance and security expenses. Other noninterest expense increased 1.1 million, or 31.5 , from 3.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 4.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily due to an increase in other real estate owned activity during the current year compared to the prior year, along with various smaller dollar increases in general operating costs during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Income Tax Expense 
 The amount of income tax expense we incur is influenced by the amounts of our pre-tax income, tax-exempt income and other nondeductible expenses. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are reflected at current income tax rates in effect for the period in which the deferred tax assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled. As changes in tax laws or rates are enacted, deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted through the provision for income taxes. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, income tax expense totaled 5.2 million and 5.8 million, respectively. The decrease in income tax expense was primarily due to a decrease in net earnings before taxes of 3.3 million. Our effective tax rates for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 19.38 and 19.34 , respectively. 
 Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations for the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 Results of Operations 
 The following discussion and analysis of our results of operations compares our results of operations for the three months ended September 30, 2024 with the three months ended September 30, 2023. The results of operations for the three months ended September 30, 2024 are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2024. 
 Net earnings attributable to Guaranty Bancshares Inc. were 7.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 6.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Basic earnings attributable to Guaranty Bancshares, Inc. per share were 0.65 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 0.54 during the same period in 2023.

(1) Net interest margin is equal to net interest income divided by average interest-earning assets. 

(2) Net interest rate spread is the average yield on interest-earning assets minus the average rate on interest-bearing liabilities. 

Net Interest Income 
 Net interest income, before the provision for credit losses, in the third quarter of 2024 and 2023 was 24.2 million and 23.3 million, respectively, an increase of 889,000, or 3.8 . The increase in net interest income resulted from an increase in interest income of 615,000, or 1.5 , from the same quarter in the prior year, assisted by a decrease in interest expense of 274,000, or 1.7 . The increase in interest income resulted primarily from a 670,000, or 16.5 , increase in interest income on securities and a 205,000, or 29.6 , increase in interest income received from Federal funds sold and interest-bearing deposits. The decrease in interest expense resulted primarily from a 2.3 million and 808,000 decrease in interest paid on FHLB borrowings and brokered deposits, respectively. These decreases were partially offset by a 2.6 million increase in interest paid on CD accounts during the third quarter of 2024, compared to the same period of the prior year. 
 Net interest margin, on a fully taxable equivalent basis, for the third quarter of 2024 and 2023 was 3.33 and 3.02 , respectively. 
 Average Balance Sheet Amounts, Interest Earned and Yield Analysis 
 The following table presents an analysis of net interest income and net interest spread for the periods indicated, including average outstanding balances for each major category of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, the interest earned or paid on such amounts, and the average rate earned or paid on such assets or liabilities, respectively. 
 The table also sets forth the net interest margin on average total interest-earning assets for the same periods. Interest earned on loans that are classified as nonaccrual is not recognized in income; however, the balances are reflected in average outstanding balances for the period. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the amount of interest income not recognized on nonaccrual loans was not material. Any nonaccrual loans have been included in the table as loans carrying a zero yield.

Provision for Credit Losses 
 We recorded a 500,000 reversal to our provision for credit losses during the third quarter of 2024. Our gross loan balances decreased by 78.5 million during the third quarter and by 186.0 million year to date, while overall credit quality trends and economic forecast assumptions remained relatively stable. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, our allowance for credit losses as a percentage of total loans was 1.34 and 1.33 , respectively. 
 Noninterest Income

Total noninterest income increased 215,000, or 4.4 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. Material changes in the components of noninterest income are discussed below. 
 Gain on Sale of Loans. We sold 33 mortgage loans for 7.9 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 35 mortgage loans for 8.9 million during the three months ended September 30, 2023. Gain on sale of loans was 252,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 34,000, or 15.6 , compared to 218,000 for the same period in 2023. The total gain on loans sold during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 consisted of a gain of 187,000 in mortgage loans and 65,000 of SBA 7(a) loans sold, compared to a gain of 190,000 in mortgage loans and a gain of 28,000 on SBA loans sold during the quarter ended September 30, 2023. 
 (Continued) 46 . 

Fiduciary and Custodial Income. We have trust powers and provide fiduciary and custodial services through our trust and wealth management division. Fiduciary income decreased 95,000, or 14.9 , compared to the same period in 2023, due to certain fee reimbursements in the current quarter for three relationships with multiple accounts. Revenue for our services fluctuates by month with the market value for all publicly traded assets, which are primarily held in irrevocable trusts and investment management accounts that carry higher fees. Additionally, our custody-only assets are carried in a tiered percentage rate fee schedule charged against market value. 
 Merchant and Debit Card Fees. We recorded a 65,000, or 3.7 , increase in merchant and debit card fees during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to growth in the number of DDAs and debit card usage volume during 2024. The total number of DDAs increased by 1,348 accounts, from 55,999 as of September 30, 2023 to 57,347 as of September 30, 2024. 
 Loan Processing Fee Income. Revenue earned from collection of loan processing fees decreased 26,000, or 20.3 , compared to the same period in 2023. The decrease was primarily due to a decline in the volume of newly originated, renewed or extended loans during the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Other Noninterest Income. This category includes a variety of other income producing activities, including mortgage loan origination fees, wire transfer fees, loan administration fees, and other fee income. Other noninterest income increased 215,000, or 28.3 , compared to the same period in 2023. The increase in other noninterest income was primarily due to rental income received during the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Noninterest Expense 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, noninterest expense totaled 20.7 million, an increase of 164,000, or 0.8 , compared to 20.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The following table presents, for the periods indicated, the major categories of noninterest expense:

Material changes in the components of noninterest expense are discussed below. 
 Employee Compensation and Benefits . Salaries and employee benefits are the largest component of noninterest expense and include payroll expense, the cost of incentive compensation, benefit plans, health insurance and payroll taxes. Salaries and employee benefits were 11.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 358,000, or 3.0 , compared to 11.9 million for the same period in 2023. The decrease resulted primarily from a 249,000 decrease in bonus expense, which is tied to earnings, and a 185,000 decrease in employee benefits, offset by a 49,000 increase in officer and employee salary expense during the quarter ended September 30, 2024. 
 Occupancy Expense. Occupancy expenses are mainly composed of depreciation expense on fixed assets and lease expense related to ASC 842 accounting. Occupancy expenses increased 66,000, or 2.2 , compared to the same quarter of the prior year. The increase was primarily due to an increase in common area maintenance costs incurred on leased properties during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to the prior year quarter. 
 Legal and Professional Fees. Legal and professional fees, which include audit, loan review and regulatory assessments other than FDIC insurance assessment fees, were 775,000 and 902,000 for the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, a decrease of 127,000, or 14.1 . The decrease was primarily due to recruiting fees paid during the quarter ended September 30, 2023 not present in the same quarter of 2024. 
 (Continued) 47 . 

Software and Technology. Software and technology expenses increased 159,000, or 10.7 , from 1.5 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023 to 1.6 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024. The increase was due to continued investments in digital banking software, tools to improve efficiencies for customers and operational departments and for cybersecurity enhancements. 
 Advertising and Promotions. Advertising and promotion-related expenses were 239,000 and 288,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, a decrease of 49,000, or 17.0 . The decrease was primarily due to decreased advertising and vendor costs in the current period, compared to the same period in the prior year. 
 Other Noninterest Expense . This category includes operating and administrative expenses, such as stock option expense, expenses related to repossession of assets, small hardware and software purchases, expense of the value of stock appreciation rights, losses incurred on problem assets, losses on sale of other real estate owned and other assets, other real estate owned expense and write-downs, business development expenses (i.e., travel and entertainment, charitable contributions and club memberships), insurance and security expenses. Other noninterest expense increased 498,000, or 39.9 , primarily due to an increase in other real estate owned-related holding costs and various smaller dollar increases in general operating costs during the third quarter of 2024, compared to the prior year quarter. 
 Income Tax Expense 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, income tax expense totaled 1.8 million and 1.4 million, respectively. The effective tax rates for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 19.50 and 18.60 , respectively. The effective tax rates differ from the statutory federal tax rate of 21 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, largely due to tax exempt interest income earned on certain investment securities and loans and the nontaxable earnings on bank-owned life insurance. 
 
 Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition as of September 30, 2024 
 Assets 
 Our total assets decreased 87.7 million, or 2.8 , from 3.18 billion as of December 31, 2023 to 3.10 billion as of September 30, 2024. The decline was primarily due to a decrease in gross loans of 186.0 million, or 8.0 , partially offset by a 73,422, or 82.0 , increase in cash and cash equivalents and a 19.1 million, or 3.2 , increase in total investment securities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Loan Portfolio 
 Our primary source of income is derived through interest earned on loans to small- to medium-sized businesses, commercial companies, professionals and individuals located in our primary market areas. A substantial portion of our loan portfolio consists of commercial and industrial loans and real estate loans secured by commercial real estate properties located in our primary market areas. Our loan portfolio represents the highest yielding component of our earning asset base. 
 Our loan portfolio is the largest category of our earning assets. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 total loans held for investment were 2.14 billion and 2.32 billion, respectively, a decrease of 186.0 million between periods. Additionally, 770,000 and 976,000 in loans were classified as held for sale as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 Total loans, excluding those held for sale, as a percentage of deposits, were 80.1 and 88.2 as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Total loans, excluding those held for sale, as a percentage of total assets, were 69.0 and 72.9 as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.

Nonperforming Assets 
 Loans are considered past due if the required principal and interest payments have not been received as of the date such payments were due. Loans are placed on nonaccrual status when, in management s opinion, the borrower may be unable to meet payment obligations as they become due, as well as when required by regulatory provisions. Loans may be placed on nonaccrual status regardless of whether or not such loans are considered past due. In general, we place loans on nonaccrual status when they become 90 days past due. We also place loans on nonaccrual status if they are less than 90 days past due if the collection of principal or interest is in doubt. When interest accrual is discontinued, all unpaid accrued interest is reversed from income. Interest income is subsequently recognized only to the extent cash payments are received in excess of principal due. Loans are returned to accrual status when all the principal and interest amounts contractually due are brought current and future payments are, in management s opinion, reasonably assured. 
 We believe our conservative lending approach and focused management of nonperforming assets has resulted in sound asset quality and timely resolution of problem assets. We have several procedures in place to assist us in maintaining the overall quality of our loan portfolio. We have established underwriting guidelines to be followed by our bankers, and we also monitor our delinquency levels for any negative or adverse trends. There can be no assurance, however, that our loan portfolio will not become subject to increasing pressures from deteriorating borrower credit due to general economic conditions. 
 Nonperforming assets as a percentage of total loans were 0.96 at September 30, 2024, compared to 0.25 at December 31, 2023. The Bank's nonperforming assets consist primarily of other real estate owned and nonaccrual loans. The increase in nonperforming assets was primarily due to the foreclosure of a multi-purpose commercial real estate loan

in the South Austin area during the first quarter of 2024. We expect little or no loss on the sale of this other real estate owned.

Potential Problem Loans 
 From a credit risk standpoint, we classify loans in one of five risk ratings: pass, special mention, substandard, doubtful or loss. Within the pass rating, we classify loans into one of the following five subcategories based on perceived credit risk, including repayment capacity and collateral security: superior, excellent, good, acceptable and acceptable/watch. The classifications of loans reflect a judgment about the risks of default and loss associated with the loan. We review the ratings on credits monthly. Ratings are adjusted to reflect the degree of risk and loss that is believed to be inherent in each credit as of each monthly reporting period. Our methodology is structured so that specific ACL allocations are increased in accordance with deterioration in credit quality (and a corresponding increase in risk and loss) or decreased in accordance with improvement in credit quality (and a corresponding decrease in risk and loss). 
 Credits rated special mention show clear signs of financial weaknesses or deterioration in creditworthiness; however, such concerns are not so pronounced that we generally expect to experience significant loss within the short-term. Such credits typically maintain the ability to perform within standard credit terms and credit exposure is not as prominent as credits with a lower rating. 
 Credits rated substandard are those in which the normal repayment of principal and interest may be, or has been, jeopardized by reason of adverse trends or developments of a financial, managerial, economic or political nature, or important weaknesses which exist in collateral. A protracted workout on these credits is a distinct possibility. Prompt corrective action is therefore required to reduce exposure and to assure that adequate remedial measures are taken by the borrower. Credit exposure becomes more likely in such credits and a serious evaluation of the secondary support to the credit is performed. 
 Credits rated as doubtful have the weaknesses of substandard assets with the additional characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full questionable and there is a high probability of loss based on currently existing facts, conditions and values. 
 (Continued) 50 . 

Credits rated as loss are charged off. We have no expectation of the recovery of any payments in respect of credits rated as loss.

Loans risk rated as substandard decreased 12.3 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 24.6 million as of December 31, 2023 to 12.3 million as of September 30, 2024. The decrease was primarily due to a few loan relationships upgraded due to on-time payments and payoffs during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Allowance for Credit Losses 
 We maintain an allowance for credit losses ACL that represents management s best estimate of the appropriate level of losses and risks inherent in our applicable financial assets under the current expected credit loss model. The amount of the allowance for credit losses should not be interpreted as an indication that charge-offs in future periods will necessarily occur in those amounts, or at all. The determination of the amount of allowance involves a high degree of judgment and subjectivity. 
 For available for sale debt securities in an unrealized loss position, the Company evaluates the securities at each measurement date to determine whether the decline in the fair value below the amortized cost basis (impairment) is due to credit-related factors or noncredit-related factors. Any impairment that is not credit related is recognized in other comprehensive income, net of applicable taxes. Credit-related impairment is recognized as an ACL on the balance sheet, limited to the amount by which the amortized cost basis exceeds the fair value, with a corresponding adjustment to earnings through provision for credit loss expense. As of September 30, 2024, the Company determined that all available for sale securities that experienced a decline in fair value below the amortized costs basis were due to noncredit-related factors, therefore no related ACL was recorded and there was no related provision expense recognized during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 For held to maturity debt securities, the Company evaluates expected credit losses on a collective basis by major security type with each type sharing similar risk characteristics, and considers historical credit loss information that is adjusted for current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. With regard to U.S. Treasury and residential mortgage-backed securities issued by the U.S. governments, or agencies thereof, it is expected that the securities will not be settled at prices less than the amortized cost bases of the securities as such securities are backed by the full faith and 
 (Continued) 51 . 

credit of and/or guaranteed by the U.S. government. Accordingly, no allowance for credit losses has been recorded for these securities. With regard to municipal securities, management considers 1) issuer bond ratings, 2) whether issuers continue to make timely principal and interest payments under the contractual terms of the securities, 3) internal forecasts and 4) whether or not such securities are guaranteed by the Texas Permanent School Fund or pre-refunded by the issuers. As of September 30, 2024, the Company determined there were no credit related concerns that warrant an ACL for the held to maturity portfolio. 
 In determining the ACL for loans held for investment, we primarily estimate losses on segments of loans with similar risk characteristics and where the potential loss can be identified and reasonably determined. For loans that do not share similar risk characteristics with our existing segments, they are evaluated individually for an ACL. Our portfolio is segmented by regulatory call report codes, with additional segments for SBA loans acquired from Westbound Bank and for SBA loans originated by us. The segments are further disaggregated by internally assigned risk rating classifications. The balance of the ACL is determined using the current expected credit loss model, which considers historical loan loss rates, changes in the nature of our loan portfolio, overall portfolio quality, industry concentrations, delinquency trends, current economic factors and reasonable and supportable forecasts of the impact of future economic conditions on loan loss rates. Please see Critical Accounting Policies - Allowance for Credit Losses . 
 In connection with the review of our loan portfolio, we consider risk elements attributable to particular loan types or categories in assessing the quality of individual loans. Some of the risk elements we consider include: 
 for commercial and industrial loans, the debt service coverage ratio (income from the business in excess of operating expenses compared to loan repayment requirements), the operating results of the commercial, industrial or professional enterprise, the borrower s business, professional and financial ability and expertise, the specific risks and volatility of income and operating results typical for businesses in that category and the value, nature and marketability of collateral; 

for commercial mortgage loans and multifamily residential loans, the debt service coverage ratio, operating results of the owner in the case of owner-occupied properties, the loan-to-value ratio, the age and condition of the collateral and the volatility of income, property value and future operating results typical of properties of that type; 

for 1-4 family residential mortgage loans, the borrower s ability to repay the loan, including a consideration of the debt-to-income ratio and employment and income stability, the loan-to-value ratio, and the age, condition and marketability of the collateral; and 

for construction and development loans, the perceived feasibility of the project including the ability to sell developed lots or improvements constructed for resale or the ability to lease property constructed for lease, the quality and nature of contracts for presale or prelease, if any, experience and ability of the developer and loan-to-value ratio. 

As of September 30, 2024, the allowance for credit losses for loans totaled 28.5 million, or 1.34 , of total loans, excluding those held for sale. As of December 31, 2023, the allowance for credit losses for loans totaled 30.9 million, or 1.33 , of total loans, excluding those held for sale.

Although we believe that we have established our allowance for credit losses in accordance with GAAP and that the allowance for credit losses was adequate to provide for known and inherent losses in the portfolio at all times shown above, future provisions for credit losses will be subject to ongoing evaluations of the risks in our loan portfolio. If our primary market areas experience economic declines, if asset quality deteriorates or if we are successful in growing the size of our loan portfolio, our allowance could become inadequate and material additional provisions for credit losses could be required.

Securities 
 We use our securities portfolio to provide a source of liquidity, provide an appropriate return on funds invested, manage interest rate risk, meet collateral requirements and meet regulatory capital requirements. As of September 30, 2024, the carrying amount of our investment securities totaled 619.5 million, a increase of 19.1 million, or 3.2 , compared to 600.4 million as of December 31, 2023. Investment securities represented 20.0 and 18.9 of total assets as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 As of September 30, 2024, securities available for sale totaled 277.6 million and securities held to maturity totaled 341.9 million. As of December 31, 2023, securities available for sale totaled 196.2 million and securities held to maturity totaled 404.2 million. 
 The carrying values of our investment securities classified as available for sale are adjusted for unrealized gain or loss, and any gain or loss is reported on an after-tax basis as a component of other comprehensive income in equity. As of September 30, 2024, the Company determined that all available for sale securities that experienced a decline in fair value below their amortized cost basis were impacted by noncredit-related factors and that securities held to maturity have not experienced credit deterioration; therefore, the Company carried no ACL with respect to our securities portfolio at September 30, 2024. 
 From time to time, we have reclassified certain securities from available for sale to held to maturity. Such transfers are made at fair value at the date of transfer. The net unrealized holding gains or losses at the date of transfer are retained in accumulated other comprehensive loss and in the carrying value of the held to maturity securities and are amortized over the remaining life of the security. The net unamortized, unrealized loss remaining on transferred securities included in accumulated other comprehensive loss in the accompanying balance sheets totaled 7.4 million at September 30, 2024, compared to a net unamortized, unrealized loss of 7.0 million at December 31, 2023. This amount will be amortized out of accumulated other comprehensive loss over the remaining life of the underlying securities as an adjustment of the yield on those securities.

The contractual maturity of mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations is not a reliable indicator of their expected life because borrowers have the right to prepay their obligations at any time. Mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations are typically issued with stated principal amounts and are backed by pools of mortgage loans and other loans with varying maturities. The term of the underlying mortgages and loans may vary significantly due to the ability of a borrower to prepay. Monthly pay downs on mortgage-backed securities typically cause the average life of the securities to be much different than the stated contractual maturity. During a period of increasing 
 (Continued) 55 . 

interest rates, fixed rate mortgage-backed securities do not tend to experience heavy prepayments of principal, and, consequently, the average life of this security is typically lengthened. If interest rates begin to fall, prepayments may increase, thereby shortening the estimated life of this security. The weighted average life of our investment portfolio was 4.94 years with an estimated effective duration of 3.83 years as of September 30, 2024. 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, we did not own securities of any one issuer, other than the U.S. government and its agencies, for which aggregate adjusted cost exceeded 10.0 of equity. 
 The average yield of our securities portfolio was 3.09 and 2.78 as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Average yield went up 31 basis points primarily due to a 75 basis point increase in yield on treasury securities and a 49 basis point increase in yield on mortgage-backed securities, which were partially offset by a 5 basis point decrease in yield on municipal securities. As of September 30, 2024, the fair value of available for sale and amortized cost of held to maturity mortgage-backed securities and municipal securities comprised 53.5 and 25.7 of the portfolio, respectively. As of December 31, 2023, mortgage-backed securities and municipal securities comprised 44.9 and 28.4 of the portfolio, respectively. 
 Deposits 
 We offer a variety of deposit products, which have a wide range of interest rates and terms, including demand, savings, money market and time accounts. We rely primarily on competitive pricing policies, convenient locations and personalized service to attract and retain these deposits. 
 Average total deposits for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 2.62 billion, a decrease of 7.4 million, or 6.1 , compared to 2.62 billion for the year ended December 31, 2023. The average rate paid on total interest-bearing deposits was 3.30 and 2.65 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and year ended December 31, 2023, respectively. The increase in average rates between periods was driven primarily by the continued repricing of lower rate deposits for higher rates.

The ratio of average noninterest-bearing deposits to average total deposits for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and year ended December 31, 2023 was 31.1 and 35.3 , respectively. 
 Total deposits as of September 30, 2024 were 2.67 billion, a increase of 35.7 million, or 1.4 , compared to 2.63 billion as of December 31, 2023. 
 Noninterest-bearing deposits as of September 30, 2024 were 839.6 million, compared to 853.0 million as of December 31, 2023, a decrease of 13.4 million, or 1.6 .

Total interest-bearing deposits as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were 1.83 billion and 1.78 billion, respectively, which represented an increase of 49.1 million, or 2.8 . 
 The aggregate amount of certificates and other time deposits in denominations greater than 250,000 as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was 314.4 million and 279.0 million, respectively. 
 The amount of uninsured certificates of deposit will differ from the total amount of certificates of deposit greater than 250,000 due to various factors, including joint account ownership.

Borrowings 
 We utilize short-term and long-term borrowings to supplement deposits to fund our lending and investment activities, each of which is discussed below. 
 Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) Advances . The FHLB allows us to borrow on a blanket floating lien status collateralized by certain securities and loans. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, total borrowing capacity of 1,048.6 million and 939.8 million, respectively, was available under this arrangement. Our outstanding FHLB advances mature within one year. As of September 30, 2024, approximately 1.83 billion in real estate loans were pledged as collateral for our FHLB borrowings. We utilize these borrowings to meet liquidity needs and to hedge interest rate risk. We had no outstanding advances as of September 30, 2024. 
 Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas . The Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas has an available borrower in custody arrangement, which allows us to borrow on a collateralized basis. Certain commercial and industrial and consumer loans are pledged under this arrangement. We maintain this borrowing arrangement to meet liquidity needs pursuant to our contingency funding plan. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, 232.5 million and 222.2 million, respectively, were available under this arrangement. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, approximately 272.9 million and 290.7 million, respectively, in consumer and commercial and industrial loans were pledged as collateral. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, no borrowings were outstanding under this arrangement. 
 Subordinated Debt, Trust Preferred Securities and Other Debentures. We have Debentures relating to the issuance of trust preferred securities. In July 2006, Trust III issued 2.0 million in trust preferred securities to a third party in a private placement. Concurrent with the issuance of the trust preferred securities, Trust III issued common securities to the Company in the aggregate liquidation value of 62,000. Trust III invested the total proceeds from the sale of the trust preferred securities and the common securities in 2.1 million of the Company s Debentures, which will mature on October 1, 2036. 
 In March 2015, we acquired DCB Trust I, which issued 5.0 million in trust preferred securities to a third party in a private placement. Concurrent with the issuance of the trust preferred securities, DCB Trust I issued common securities to the Company in the aggregate liquidation value of 155,000. DCB Trust I invested the total proceeds from the sale of the trust preferred securities and the common securities in 5.2 million of the Company s Debentures, which will mature on June 15, 2037. 
 With certain exceptions, the amount of the principal and any accrued and unpaid interest on the Debentures are subordinated in right of payment to the prior payment in full of all of our senior indebtedness. The terms of the Debentures are such that they qualify as Tier 1 capital under the Federal Reserve s regulatory capital guidelines applicable to bank holding companies. Interest on the Trust III Debentures is payable at a variable rate per annum, reset quarterly, equal to the then-current three month term Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("SOFR") plus 1.93 . Interest on the DCB Trust I Debentures is payable at a variable rate per annum, reset quarterly, equal to 3-month SOFR plus 2.06 . The interest is deferrable on a cumulative basis for up to five consecutive years following a suspension of dividend payments on all other capital stock. No principal payments are due until maturity for each of the Debentures. 
 Both the DCB Trust I Debentures and the Trust III Debentures are redeemable, in whole or in part, at our option after at least 30, but not more than 60, days' notice, on any interest payment date, at a redemption price equal to 100 of the amount to be redeemed, plus accrued interest to the date of redemption. 
 (Continued) 57 . 

On March 4, 2022, the Company completed a private placement of 35.0 million aggregate principal amount of its fixed-to-floating rate subordinated note due April 1, 2032. The subordinated note initially bears a fixed interest rate of 3.625 per year, due semi-annually in arrears on April 1 and October 1. Commencing on April 1, 2027, the interest rate on the subordinated note will reset each quarter at a floating interest rate equal to the then-current three month term SOFR plus 192 basis points. The Company may at its option redeem in whole or in part the subordinated note on or after March 4, 2027 without a premium. The subordinated note is treated as Tier 2 Capital for regulatory purposes (subject to reductions in the amount includable as Tier 2 capital in the final five years prior to maturity), and is presented net of 332,000 in related unamortized issuance costs on the consolidated balance sheets. 
 On May 1, 2020, the Company issued 10.0 million in debentures to directors and other related parties. The debentures have stated maturity dates between November 1, 2020 and November 1, 2024, and bear interest at fixed annual rates between 1.00 and 4.00 . The Company pays interest semi-annually on May 1st and November 1st in arrears during the term of the debentures. Various portions of these debentures have matured since issuance and 2.0 million remains outstanding as of September 30, 2024. The debentures are redeemable by the Company at its option, in whole in or part, at any time on or before the due date of any debenture. The redemption price is equal to 100 of the face amount of the debenture redeemed, plus all accrued but unpaid interest. 
 Other Borrowings. We have historically used a line of credit with a correspondent bank as a source of funding for working capital needs, the payment of dividends when there is a temporary timing difference in cash flows, and repurchases of equity securities. In March 2017, we entered into an unsecured revolving line of credit for 25.0 million, and we renewed that line of credit in March 2024. The line of credit bears interest at the prime rate (8.00 as of September 30, 2024) subject to a floor of 3.50 , with quarterly interest payments, and matures in March 2025. As of September 30, 2024, there was no outstanding balance on the line of credit. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Liquidity 
 Liquidity involves our ability to raise funds to support asset growth and acquisitions or reduce assets to meet deposit withdrawals and other payment obligations, to maintain reserve requirements and otherwise to operate on an ongoing basis and manage unexpected events. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and the year ended December 31, 2023, liquidity needs were primarily met by core deposits, security and loan maturities and amortizing investment and loan portfolios. Although access to purchased funds from correspondent banks and overnight or longer term advances from the FHLB and the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas are available, and have been utilized on occasion to take advantage of investment opportunities, we do not generally rely on these external funding sources. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we maintained two federal funds lines of credit with commercial banks that provide for the availability to borrow up to an aggregate 75.0 million in federal funds. There were no funds under these lines of credit outstanding as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
 Contingent liquidity sources and availability as of September 30, 2024 are provided below. The table below shows our total lines of credit and current borrowings as of September 30, 2024 and total amounts available for future borrowings, if necessary.

Our primary source of funds is deposits, and our primary use of funds is loans. We do not expect a change in the primary source or use of our funds in the foreseeable future. Our average loans, including average loans held for sale, decreased 125.3 million, or 5.3 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023, while our average deposits increased 3.1 million, or 0.1 , for the same time period. We predominantly invest excess deposits in overnight deposits with our correspondent banks, federal funds sold, securities, interest-bearing deposits at other banks or other short-term liquid investments until needed to fund loan growth. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 302.3 million in outstanding commitments to extend credit and 9.6 million in commitments associated with outstanding standby and commercial letters of credit. As of December 31, 2023, we had 336.0 million in outstanding commitments to extend credit and 7.5 million in commitments associated with outstanding standby and commercial letters of credit. Since commitments associated with letters of credit and commitments to extend credit may expire unused, the total outstanding may not necessarily reflect the actual future cash funding requirements. 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had no exposure to future cash requirements associated with known uncertainties or capital expenditures of a material nature. As of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of 162.9 million, compared to 89.5 million as of December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily due to an increase in federal funds sold of 71.8 million, which is used for liquidity purposes. 
 Capital Resources 
 Total equity increased to 319.3 million as of September 30, 2024, compared to 303.8 million as of December 31, 2023, an increase of 15.4 million, or 5.1 . The increase from December 31, 2023 was due to net earnings attributable to Guaranty Bancshares, Inc. of 21.5 million and a positive shift in our net unrealized losses on securities during the period. The increase was offset primarily by the payment of dividends of 8.3 million and by the repurchase of stock totaling 6.3 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Capital management consists of providing equity and other instruments that qualify as regulatory capital to support current and future operations. Banking regulators view capital levels as important indicators of an institution s financial soundness. As a general matter, FDIC-insured depository institutions and their holding companies are required to maintain minimum capital relative to the amount and types of assets they hold. We are subject to certain regulatory capital requirements at the bank holding company and bank levels. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we were 
 (Continued) 59 . 

in compliance with all applicable regulatory capital requirements at the bank and bank holding company levels, and the Bank was classified as well capitalized, for purposes of the prompt corrective action regulations. As we deploy our capital, our regulatory capital levels may decrease depending on our level of earnings and provisions for credit losses. However, we expect to closely monitor our loan portfolio, operating expenses and overall capital levels in order to remain in compliance with all regulatory capital standards applicable to us.

Off-Balance Sheet Items 
 In the normal course of business, we enter into various transactions, which, in accordance with GAAP, are not included in our consolidated balance sheets. We enter into these transactions to meet the financing needs of our customers. These transactions include commitments to extend credit and standby and commercial letters of credit, which involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit risk and interest rate risk in excess of the amounts recognized in our consolidated balance sheets. 
 Our commitments associated with outstanding standby and commercial letters of credit and commitments to extend credit expiring by period as of September 30, 2024 are summarized below.

In the event of nonperformance by the customer, we have rights to the underlying collateral, which can include commercial real estate, physical plant and property, inventory, receivables, cash and/or marketable securities. Our credit risk associated with issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as the risk involved in extending

loan facilities to our customers. Management evaluated the likelihood of funding the standby and commercial letters of credit as of September 30, 2024, and determined the likelihood to be improbable. Therefore, no ACL was recorded for standby and commercial letters of credit as of September 30, 2024. 
 Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. Since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being fully drawn upon, the total commitment amounts disclosed above do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. We evaluate each customer s creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral obtained, if considered necessary by us, upon extension of credit, is based on management s credit evaluation of the customer. 
 Loan agreements executed in connection with construction loans and commercial lines of credit have standard conditions which must be met prior to the Company being required to provide additional funding, including conditions precedent that typically include: (i) no event of default or potential default has occurred; (ii) that no material adverse events have taken place that would materially affect the borrower or the value of the collateral, (iii) that the borrower remains in compliance with all loan obligations and covenants and has made no misrepresentations; (iv) that the collateral has not been damaged or impaired; (v) that the project remains on budget and in compliance with all laws and regulations; and (vi) that all management agreements, lease agreements and franchise agreements that affect the value of the collateral remain in force. If the conditions precedent have not been met, the Company retains the option to cease current draws and/or future funding. As a result of these conditions within our loan agreements, management believes the credit risk of these off balance sheet items is minimal and we recorded no ACL with respect to these loan agreements as of September 30, 2024. 
 Interest Rate Sensitivity and Market Risk 
 As a financial institution, our primary component of market risk is interest rate volatility. Our asset liability and funds management policy provides management with the guidelines for effective funds management, and we have established a measurement system for monitoring our net interest rate sensitivity position. We have historically managed our sensitivity position within our established guidelines. 
 Inflation in the U.S. remains elevated but has improved from very high levels in recent years. The high inflation was primarily a result of lingering effects from the COVID-19 pandemic and related governmental policies, as well as other geo-political factors. However, unlike many industrial companies, substantially all of our assets and liabilities are monetary in nature, which means that interest rates have a more significant impact on our performance than the effects of general levels of inflation. 
 To combat record levels of inflation, the Federal Reserve approved its first interest rate increase in the current cycle in March 2022 and raised interest rates by 525 basis points over 15 months, before lowering rates by 50 basis points during the three months ended September 30, 2024. If the Federal Reserve continues to decrease interest rates, we expect those decreases to have a slightly positive impact on our net income in the short term due to timing differences in asset and liability repricing, and we expect a net positive impact on our net income, despite likely absolute increases in our operating expenses due to inflation. 
 Fluctuations in interest rates will ultimately impact both the level of income and expense recorded on most of our assets and liabilities, and the market value of all interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, other than those which have a short term to maturity. Interest rate risk is the potential of economic losses due to future interest rate changes. These economic losses can be reflected as a loss of future net interest income and/or a loss of current fair market values. The objective is to measure the effect on net interest income and to adjust the balance sheet to minimize the inherent risk while at the same time maximizing income. 
 We manage our exposure to interest rates by structuring our balance sheet in the ordinary course of business. We do not enter into instruments such as leveraged derivatives, financial options, financial future contracts or forward delivery contracts for the purpose of reducing interest rate risk. Based upon the nature of our operations, we are not subject to foreign exchange or commodity price risk. We do not own any trading assets. 
 Our exposure to interest rate risk is managed by the asset-liability committee of the Bank, in accordance with policies approved by its board of directors. The committee formulates strategies based on appropriate levels of interest rate risk. In determining the appropriate level of interest rate risk, the committee considers the impact on earnings and capital on the current outlook on interest rates, potential changes in interest rates, regional economies, liquidity, business strategies and other factors. The committee meets regularly to review, among other things, the sensitivity of assets and liabilities to interest rate changes, the book and market values of assets and liabilities, unrealized gains and losses, purchase and sale 
 (Continued) 61 . 

activities, commitments to originate loans and the maturities of investments and borrowings. Additionally, the committee reviews liquidity, cash flow flexibility, maturities of deposits and consumer and commercial deposit activity. Management employs methodologies to manage interest rate risk, which include an analysis of relationships between interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and an interest rate shock simulation model. 
 We use interest rate risk simulation models and shock analyses to test the interest rate sensitivity of net interest income and fair value of equity, and the impact of changes in interest rates on other financial metrics. Contractual maturities and re-pricing opportunities of loans are incorporated in the model as are prepayment assumptions, maturity data and call options within the investment portfolio. Average life of non-maturity deposit accounts are based on standard regulatory decay assumptions and are incorporated into the model. The assumptions used are inherently uncertain and, as a result, the model cannot precisely measure future net interest income or precisely predict the impact of fluctuations in market interest rates on net interest income. Actual results will differ from the model s simulated results due to timing, magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes as well as changes in market conditions and the application and timing of various management strategies. 
 On a quarterly basis, we run two simulation models including a static balance sheet and dynamic growth balance sheet. These models test the impact on net interest income and fair value of equity from changes in market interest rates under various scenarios. Under the static and dynamic growth models, rates are shocked instantaneously and ramped rate changes over a twelve-month horizon based upon parallel and non-parallel yield curve shifts. Parallel shock scenarios assume instantaneous parallel movements in the yield curve compared to a flat yield curve scenario. Non-parallel simulation involves analysis of interest income and expense under various changes in the shape of the yield curve. Our internal policy regarding internal rate risk simulations currently specifies that for instantaneous parallel shifts of the yield curve, estimated net income at risk for the subsequent one-year period should not decline by more than 10.0 for a 100 basis point shift, 15.0 for a 200 basis point shift and 25.0 for a 300 basis point shift. 
 The following table summarizes the simulated change in net interest income and fair value of equity over a 12-month horizon as of:

The results are primarily due to behavior of demand, money market and savings deposits during such rate fluctuations. We have found that, historically, interest rates on these deposits change more slowly than changes in the discount and federal funds rates. This assumption is incorporated into the simulation model and is generally not fully reflected in a gap analysis. The assumptions incorporated into the model are inherently uncertain and, as a result, the model cannot precisely measure future net interest income or precisely predict the impact of fluctuations in market interest rates on net interest income. Actual results will differ from the model s simulated results due to timing, magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes as well as changes in market conditions and the application and timing of various strategies. 
 Impact of Inflation 
 Our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Report have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. GAAP requires the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars, without considering changes in the relative value of money over time due to inflation or deflation. 
 Unlike many industrial companies, substantially all of our assets and liabilities are monetary in nature. As a result, interest rates have a more significant impact on our performance than the effects of general levels of inflation. Interest rates may not necessarily move in the same direction or in the same magnitude as the prices of goods and services. However, other operating expenses do reflect general levels of inflation. 
 (Continued) 62 . 

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 Our accounting and reporting policies conform to GAAP and the prevailing practices in the banking industry. However, we also evaluate our performance based on certain additional financial measures discussed in this Report as being non-GAAP financial measures. We classify a financial measure as being a non-GAAP financial measure if that financial measure excludes or includes amounts, or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of excluding or including amounts, that are included or excluded, as the case may be, in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP as in effect from time to time in the United States in our statements of income, balance sheets or statements of cash flows. Non-GAAP financial measures do not include operating and other statistical measures or ratios or statistical measures calculated using exclusively either financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, operating measures or other measures that are not non-GAAP financial measures or both. We consider the use of select non-GAAP financial measures and ratios to be useful for financial and operational decision making and useful in evaluating period-to-period comparisons. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance by excluding certain expenditures or assets that we believe are not indicative of our primary business operating results or by presenting certain metrics on a fully taxable equivalent basis. We believe that management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our performance and when planning, forecasting, analyzing and comparing past, present and future periods. 
 The non-GAAP financial measures that we discuss in this Report should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the most directly comparable or other financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Moreover, the manner in which we calculate the non-GAAP financial measures that we discuss in this Report may differ from that of other companies reporting measures with similar names. It is important to understand how other banking organizations calculate their financial measures with names similar to the non-GAAP financial measures we have discussed in this Report when comparing such non-GAAP financial measures.

Cautionary Notice Regarding Forward-Looking Statements 
 (Continued) 63 . 

This Report, our other filings with the SEC, and other press releases, documents, reports and announcements that we make, issue or publish may contain statements that we believe are forward-looking statements within the meaning of section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"). These forward-looking statements reflect our current views with respect to, among other things, future events and our financial performance, including our future revenues, income, expenses, provision for taxes, effective tax rate, earnings per share and cash flows, our future capital expenditures and dividends, our future financial condition and changes therein, including changes in our loan portfolio and allowance for credit losses, our future capital structure or changes therein, the plan and objectives of management for future operations, our future or proposed acquisitions, the future or expected effect of acquisitions on our operations, results of the operations and financial condition, our future economic performance and the statements of the assumptions underlying any such statement. These statements are often, but not always, made through the use of words or phrases such as may, should, could, predict, potential, believe, will likely result, expect, continue, will, anticipate, seek, estimate, intend, plan, projection, would and outlook, or the negative version of those words or other comparable words or phrases of a future or forward-looking nature. These forward-looking statements are not historical facts, and are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about our industry, management s beliefs and certain assumptions made by management, many of which, by their nature, are inherently uncertain and beyond our control. Accordingly, we caution you that any such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks, assumptions and uncertainties that are difficult to predict. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in these forward-looking statements are reasonable as of the date made, actual results may prove to be materially different from the results expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. 
 There are or will be important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those indicated in these forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, the following: 
 our ability to prudently manage our growth and execute our strategy; 

risks associated with our acquisition and de novo branching strategy; 

business and economic conditions generally and in the financial services industry, nationally and within our primary Texas markets; 

concentration of our business within our geographic areas of operation in Texas; 

deterioration of our asset quality and higher loan charge-offs; 

changes in the value of collateral securing our loans; 

inaccuracies in the assumptions and estimate we make in establishing the allowance for credit losses reserve and other estimates; 

changes in management personnel and our ability to attract, motivate and retain qualified personnel; 

liquidity risks associated with our business; 

interest rate risk associated with our business that could decrease net interest income; 

our ability to maintain important deposit customer relationships and our reputation; 

operational risks associated with our business; 

volatility and direction of market interest rates; 

change in regulatory requirements to maintain minimum capital levels; 

increased competition in the financial services industry, particularly from regional and national institutions; 

institution and outcome of litigation and other legal proceeding against us or to which we become subject; 

changes in the laws, rules, regulations, interpretations or policies relating to financial institution, accounting, tax, trade, monetary and fiscal matters; 

further government intervention in the U.S. financial system; 

changes in the scope and cost of FDIC insurance and other coverage; 

natural disasters and adverse weather, acts of terrorism (including cyberattacks), an outbreak of hostilities or public health outbreaks (such as COVID-19), or other international or domestic calamities, and other matters beyond our control; 

risks that the financial institutions we may acquire or de novo branches we may open will not be integrated successfully, or the integrations may be more time consuming or costly than expected; 

technology related changes are difficult to make or are more expensive than expected; and 

the other factors that are described under the caption Risk Factors or referenced in this report, our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, and other risks included in the Company s filings with the SEC. 

The foregoing factors should not be construed as exhaustive and should be read together with the other cautionary statements included in this Report. If one or more events related to these or other risks or uncertainties materialize, or if our 
 (Continued) 64 . 

underlying assumptions prove to be incorrect, actual results may differ materially from what we anticipate. Accordingly, you should not place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements. Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which it is made, and we do not undertake any obligation to publicly update or review any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise. New factors emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict which will arise. In addition, we cannot assess the impact of each factor on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualita tive Disclosures About Market Risk 
 The Company manages market risk, which, as a financial institution is primarily interest rate volatility, through the Asset-Liability Committee of the Bank, in accordance with policies approved by its board of directors. The Company uses an interest rate risk simulation model and shock analysis to test the interest rate sensitivity of net interest income and fair value of equity, and the impact of changes in interest rates on other financial metrics. See Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Interest Rate Sensitivity and Market Risk herein for a discussion of how we manage market risk. 
 Item 4. Control s and Procedures 
 Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures: 
 As of the end of the period covered by this Report, the Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of its management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management was required to apply judgment in evaluating its controls and procedures. Based on this evaluation, the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) were effective as of the end of the period covered by this Report. 
 Changes in internal control over financial reporting: 
 There were no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting. 
 PART II. OTHE R INFORMATION 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 The Company is from time to time subject to claims and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business. These claims and litigation may include, among other things, allegations of violation of banking and other applicable regulations, competition law, labor laws and consumer protection laws, as well as claims or litigation relating to intellectual property, securities, breach of contract and tort. The Company intends to defend itself vigorously against any pending or future claims and litigation. 
 At this time, in the opinion of management, the likelihood is remote that the impact of such proceedings, either individually or in the aggregate, would have a material adverse effect on the Company s combined results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. However, one or more unfavorable outcomes in any claim or litigation against the Company could have a material adverse effect for the period in which they are resolved. In addition, regardless of their merits or their ultimate outcomes, such matters are costly, divert management s attention and may materially adversely affect the Company s reputation, even if resolved in the Company s favor. 
 Item 1A. Ri sk Factors 
 In evaluating an investment in the Company s common stock, investors should consider carefully, among other things, the risk factors previously disclosed under the caption Risk Factors in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, and other risks included in the Company s filings with the SEC. The Company s business could be harmed by any of these risks. The trading price of the Company s common stock could decline due to 
 (Continued) 65 . 

any of these risks, and you may lose all or part of your investment. There have been no material changes in the Company s risk factors from those disclosed in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equi ty Securities and Use of Proceeds 
 On April 21, 2022, the Company announced the adoption of a stock repurchase program that authorized the repurchase of up to 1,000,000 shares of the Company common stock, which was effective until April 21, 2024. On March 13, 2024, the Company approved a new stock repurchase program that authorized the repurchase of up to 1,250,000 shares of the Company common stock. The new stock repurchase program became effective on April 21, 2024 and will continue to be in effect until the earlier of April 21, 2026, or the date all shares authorized for repurchase under the program have been repurchased, unless shortened or extended by the board of directors. The repurchase plan permits shares to be acquired from time to time in the open market or negotiated transactions at prices management considers to be attractive and in the best interest of both the Company and its shareholders, subject to compliance with applicable laws and regulations, general market and economic conditions, the financial and regulatory condition of the Company, liquidity and other factors.
