 The Company s foreign currency exposure relates primarily to international transactions where the currency collected from customers can be different from the currency used to purchase the product. In cases where the Company is not able to create a natural hedge by maintaining offsetting asset and liability amounts in the same currency, it may enter into foreign exchange contracts, typically in the form of forward purchase agreements, to facilitate the hedging of foreign currency exposures to mitigate the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. These contracts generally have terms of no more than three months. The Company does not apply hedge accounting to these contracts and therefore the changes in fair value are recorded in earnings. The Company does not enter into foreign exchange contracts for trading purposes and the risk of loss on a foreign exchange contract is the risk of nonperformance by the counterparties, which the Company minimizes by limiting its counterparties to major financial institutions. The Company recognized an unrealized loss of approximately million on contracts outstanding as of September 30, 2024 , which is included in foreign currency transaction loss in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. 

Generally, software products are sold with accompanying third -party delivered software assurance, which is a product that allows customers to upgrade, at no additional cost, to the latest technology if new capabilities are introduced during the period that the software assurance is in effect. The Company evaluates whether the software assurance is a separate performance obligation by assessing if the third -party delivered software assurance is critical or essential to the core functionality of the software itself. This involves considering if the software provides its original intended functionality to the customer without the updates, if the customer would ascribe a higher value to the upgrades versus the up-front deliverable, if the customer would expect frequent intelligence updates to the software (such as updates that maintain the original functionality), and if the customer chooses to not delay or always install upgrades. If the Company determines that the accompanying third -party delivered software assurance is critical or essential to the core functionality of the software license, the software license and the accompanying third -party delivered software assurance are recognized as a single performance obligation. The value of the product is primarily the accompanying support delivered by a third party and therefore the Company is acting as an agent in these transactions and recognizes them on a net basis at the point the associated software license is delivered to the customer. The Company sells cloud computing solutions that utilize third -party vendors to enable customers to access data center functionality in a cloud-based solution, including storage, computing and networking and access to software in the cloud that enhances office productivity, provides security or assists in collaboration. The Company recognizes revenue for cloud computing solutions for arrangements with one -time invoicing to the customer at the time of invoice on a net basis as the Company is acting as an agent in the transaction. For monthly subscription-based arrangements, the Company is acting as an agent in the transaction and recognizes revenue as it invoices the customer for its monthly usage on a net basis. For software licenses where the accompanying third -party delivered software assurance is not critical or essential to the core functionality, the software assurance is recognized as a separate performance obligation, with the associated revenue recognized on a net basis at the point the related software license is delivered to the customer. 
 
 The Company also sells some of its products and services as part of bundled contract arrangements containing multiple deliverables, which may include a combination of products and services. For each deliverable that represents a distinct performance obligation, total arrangement consideration is allocated based upon the standalone selling prices SSP of each performance obligation. SSP is determined based on the price at which the performance obligation is sold separately. If the standalone selling price is not observable through established standard prices, we use judgement and estimate the standalone selling price considering available information such as market pricing and pricing related to similar products. 
 
 The Company pays commissions and related payroll taxes to sales personnel when customers are invoiced. These costs are recorded as selling, general and administrative expenses in the period earned as all our performance obligations are complete within a short window of processing the order. 

million (subject to certain adjustments) plus a potential post-closing earnout payment. DSS distributes software to VARs and campus stores across North America in both the K- 12 and higher education markets, furthering the Company's reach into these markets. The Purchase Agreement contains customary representations, warranties, covenants and indemnities. The acquisition was funded utilizing cash from the Company s balance sheet. 
 
 The financial position and operating results of DSS is included in the Company s consolidated financial statements from the date of the acquisition. The Company recorded net revenue for DSS of approximately million and net income of approximately million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , respectively. 
 
 The impact of the acquisition s preliminary purchase price allocations on the Company s consolidated balance sheet and the acquisition date fair value of the total consideration transferred is depicted in the table below. Due to the timing of the closing of the transaction in the third quarter of 2024, the Company has not yet completed its evaluation and determination of certain assets acquired and liabilities assumed, primarily the final valuation of goodwill and intangible assets; therefore, the final fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, which will be completed within the measurement period of up to one year from the acquisition date, may vary from the Company s preliminary estimates: 

Inventory 
 Right-of-use asset 
 Other assets 
 Accounts payable and accrued expenses 
 Lease liability, current portion 
 Lease liability, non-current portion 
 Intangibles - Vendor Relationships 
 Goodwill 
 Net assets 

Contingent earn-out 
 Total purchase consideration 

Intangible assets are comprised of approximately million of vendor relationships with a weighted average amortization period of years, representing the expected period of benefits. Goodwill, which was allocated to the Distribution segment, is the excess of the consideration transferred over the net assets recognized and represents the expected revenue and cost synergies of the combined company and assembled workforce. Goodwill recognized as a result of the acquisition is not deductible for income tax purposes. 
 
 The Company used the income approach to value the intangible assets, representing acquired vendor relationships. The fair value measurements were primarily based on significant inputs that are not observable, which are categorized as a Level 3 measurement in the fair value hierarchy (See Note 18 Fair Value Measurements). Inputs used to value these intangible assets include the discount rate, projection of all future cash flows, long-term growth rates, vendor attrition rates and applicable income tax rates. The excess purchase price recorded to goodwill primarily represents the future economic benefits the Company expects to achieve as a result of combining operations and expanding vendor relationships. 
 
 The purchase consideration included approximately million fair value for potential earn-out consideration if certain targets are achieved by September 30, 2025, payable in cash. There were no material changes in fair value since the acquisition date. The fair value earn-out measurement was primarily based on inputs that are not observable, which are categorized as a Level 3 measurement in the fair value hierarchy (See Note 18 Fair Value Measurements), reflecting its assessment of the assumptions market participants would use to value these liabilities. The undiscounted payment of the earn-out can range from up to approximately million and achievement is based on the post-acquisition results of DSS. 
 
 Acquisition of Data Solutions Holdings Limited 

On
 October 6, 2023, the Company entered into a Share Purchase Agreement and purchased the entire share capital of Data Solutions Holdings Limited Data Solutions for an aggregate purchase price of approximately
 15.0 million (equivalent to
 million USD), subject to certain working capital and other adjustments, paid at closing plus a potential post-closing earn-out. The allocation of the purchase price was based on the estimated fair value of Data Solutions net tangible and identifiable intangible assets as of the date of the acquisition. The transaction was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting.

The purchase consideration included approximately million fair value for potential earn-out consideration if certain targets are achieved, payable in cash. As of September 30, 2024 , the Company reassessed the earn-out liability and increased the fair value of the earn out liability to approximately million, with million adjustment recognized within change in fair value of acquisition contingent consideration during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 . The earn-out liability is included in current liabilities as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , as payment will be due during the fourth quarter of 2024. 
 
 In connection with the acquisition of Data Solutions on October 6, 2023, the Company acquired an invoice discounting facility IDF that is with recourse to the Company (See Note 11 Credit Facilities). The balance outstanding under the IDF at September 30, 2024 was , as the Company terminated the IDF during the period, compared to million at December 31, 2023 , which is included in accounts payable and accrued expenses on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , the Company recognized acquisition related costs of million and million, respectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , the Company recognized acquisition related costs of million and million. These acquisition related costs are reflected in the accompanying consolidated statements of earnings. The costs incurred during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily related to the aforementioned DSS acquisition, while the costs incurred during the prior period three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 related to the aforementioned Data Solutions acquisition. 
 
 Pro Forma Results (unaudited) 
 
 The following unaudited pro forma financial information summarizes the results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 as if the acquisition of DSS and Data Solutions has been completed as of the beginning of the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , respectively. The pro forma results are based upon certain assumptions and estimates, and they give effect to actual operating results prior to the acquisitions and adjustments to reflect income taxes at a rate consistent with the tax rates of the local jurisdictions. As a result, these pro forma results do not necessarily represent results that would have occurred if the acquisitions had taken place on the basis assumed above, nor are they indicative of the results of future combined periods.

years to years. The Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and lease expense for these leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. 

Right-of-use ROU assets represent the Company s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement date of the lease based on the present value of the lease payments over the lease term. As our leases do not provide a readily determinable implicit rate, we use an incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date, including lease term, in determining the present value of future payments. The operating lease asset also includes any lease payments made and excludes lease incentives. Operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term and included in selling, general and administrative expenses.

In limited circumstances, the Company offers extended payment terms to customers for periods of to months. The related customer receivables are classified as accounts receivable long-term and discounted to their present value at prevailing market rates at the time of sale. In subsequent periods, the accounts receivable is increased to the amounts due and payable by the customers through the accretion of interest income on the unpaid accounts receivable due in future years. The amounts under these long-term accounts receivable due within one year are reclassified to the current portion of accounts receivable.

In determining fair value, the Company utilizes valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs to the extent possible. Observable or market inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect the Company s assumptions based on the best information available. The approach to estimating the contingent earn-out associated with the Company s business combinations uses unobservable factors such as projected cash flows over the term of the contingent earn-out periods. 

The Company s investment in treasury bills are measured at fair value on a recurring basis based on quoted market prices in active markets and are classified as level 1 within the fair value hierarchy. The Company s contingent earn-out liability is measured at fair value on a recurring basis and is classified as level 3 within the fair value hierarchy. During the fourth quarter of each year, the Company evaluates goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level. The Company uses qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform a goodwill impairment test. This measurement is classified based on level 3 input.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 
 
 This following information should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes included in Item 1 of Part I of this Quarterly Report and the audited consolidated financial statements and notes, and Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, contained in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. In addition to historical information, the following discussion contains certain forward-looking information. See Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements above for certain information concerning -forward-looking statements. 
 
 Overview 
 
 Our Company is a value added IT distribution and solutions company, primarily selling software and other third-party IT products and services through two reportable operating segments. Through our Distribution segment we sell products and services to corporate resellers, value added resellers (VARs), consultants and systems integrators worldwide, who in turn sell these products to end users. Through our Solutions segment we act as a cloud solutions provider and value-added reseller, selling computer software and hardware developed by others and provide technical services directly to end user customers worldwide. We offer an extensive line of products from leading software vendors and tools for virtualization/cloud computing, security, networking, storage and infrastructure management, application lifecycle management and other technically sophisticated domains as well as computer hardware. We market these products through creative marketing communications, including our web sites, local and on-line seminars, webinars, social media, direct e-mail, and printed materials. 
 
 We have subsidiaries in the United States, Canada, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and Ireland, through which sales are made. 
 
 Factors Influencing Our Financial Results 
 
 We derive the majority of our net sales through the sale of third-party software licenses, maintenance and service agreements. In our Distribution segment, sales are impacted by the number of product lines we distribute, and sales penetration of those products into the reseller channel, product lifecycle competition, and demand characteristics of the products which we are authorized to distribute. In our Solutions segment sales are generally driven by sales force effectiveness and success in providing superior customer service and cloud solutions support, competitive pricing, and flexible payment solutions to our customers. Our sales are also impacted by external factors such as levels of IT spending and customer demand for products we distribute. 
 
 We sell in a competitive environment where gross product margins have historically declined due to competition and changes in product mix towards products where no delivery of a physical product is required. In addition, we grant discounts, allowances, and rebates to certain customers, which may vary from period to period, based on volume, payment terms and other criteria. To date, we have been able to implement cost efficiencies such as the use of drop shipments, electronic ordering (EDI) and other capabilities to be able to operate our business profitably as gross margins have declined. We evaluate the profitability of our business based on return on equity and effective margin. 
 
 Gross profit is calculated as net sales less cost of sales. We record customer rebates, discounts and returns as a component of net sales and record vendor rebates, discounts and returns as a component of cost of sales. 
 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses are comprised mainly of employee salaries, commissions and other employee related expenses, facility costs, costs to maintain our IT infrastructure, public company compliance costs and professional fees. We monitor our level of accounts payable, inventory turnover and accounts receivable turnover which are measures of how efficiently we utilize capital in our business. 
 
 The Company s sales, gross profit and results of operations have fluctuated and are expected to continue to fluctuate on a quarterly basis as a result of a number of factors, including but not limited to: the condition of the software industry in general, shifts in demand for software products, pricing, industry shipments of new software products or upgrades, fluctuations in merchandise returns, adverse weather conditions that affect response, distribution or shipping, shifts in the timing of holidays and changes in the Company s product offerings. The Company s operating expenditures are based on sales forecasts. If sales do not meet expectations in any given quarter, operating results may be materially adversely affected.

Dividend Policy and Share Repurchase Program. Historically we have sought to return value to investors through the payment of quarterly dividends and share repurchases. Total dividends paid and the dollar value of the shares repurchased were 0.8 million and 0.3 million, r espectively, during the three months ended September 30, 2024. Total dividends paid and the dollar value of the shares repurchased were 0.8 million and 0.2 million, respectively, during the three months ended September 30, 2023. The payment of future dividends and share repurchases is at the discretion of our Board of Directors and dependent on results of operations, projected capital requirements, applicable legal, tax and regulatory restrictions, and other factors the Board of Directors may find relevant. 
 
 Stock Volatility. The technology, distribution and services sectors of the United States stock markets is subject to substantial volatility. Numerous conditions which impact these sectors or the stock market in general or the Company in particular, whether or not such events relate to or reflect upon the Company s operating performance, could adversely affect the market price of the Company s Common Stock. Furthermore, fluctuations in the Company s operating results, announcements regarding litigation, the loss of a significant vendor or customer, increased competition, reduced vendor incentives and trade credit, higher operating expenses, and other developments, could have a significant impact on the market price of our Common Stock. 
 
 Inflation . We have historically not been adversely affected by inflation, as abrupt changes in technology, rapid changes in customer preferences, short product life cycles and evolving industry standards within the IT industry have generally caused the prices of the products we sell to decline. This requires us to sell new products and have growth in unit sales of existing products in order to increase our net sales. We believe that most price increases could be passed on to our customers, as prices charged by us are not set by long-term contracts; however, as a result of competitive pressure, there can be no assurance that the full effect of any such price increases could be passed on to our customers or cause a reduction in our customers spending.

 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 
 Management s discussion and analysis of the Company s financial condition and results of operations are based upon the Company s consolidated financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America US GAAP ). The preparation of these financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. 
 
 On an on-going basis, the Company evaluates its estimates, including those related to product returns, bad debts, inventories, intangible assets, income taxes, stock-based compensation, contingencies and litigation. 
 
 The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. 
 
 The Company believes the following critical accounting policies used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements affect its more significant judgments and estimates. 

23

Table of Contents 

Revenue 
 
 The Company utilizes judgment regarding performance obligations inherent in the products for services it sells including, whether ongoing maintenance obligations performed by third party vendors are distinct from the related software licenses, and allocation of sales prices among distinct performance obligations. These estimates require significant judgment to determine whether the software s functionality is dependent on ongoing maintenance or if substantially all functionality is available in the original software download. We also use judgment in the allocation of sales proceeds among performance obligations, utilizing observable data such as stand-alone selling prices, or market pricing for similar products and services. 
 
 Allowances for Expected Credit Losses 
 
 The Company maintains allowances for expected credit losses for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments. Management determines the estimate of the allowance for expected credit losses by considering a number of factors, including historical experience, aging of the accounts receivable, as well as current market conditions and future forecasts of our customers ability to make payments for goods and services. At the time of sale, we record an estimate for sales returns based on historical experience, which is included in accounts payable and accrued expenses on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. If actual sales returns are greater than estimated by management, additional expense may be incurred. 
 
 Business Combinations 
 
 We apply the provisions of ASC 805, Business Combinations ASC 805 ), in accounting for our acquisitions. ASC 805 requires that we evaluate whether a transaction pertains to an acquisition of assets, or to an acquisition of a business. A business is defined as an integrated set of assets and activities that is capable of being conducted and managed for the purpose of providing a return to investors. Asset acquisitions are accounted for by allocating the cost of the acquisition to the individual assets and liabilities assumed on a relative fair value basis; whereas the acquisition of a business requires us to recognize separately from goodwill the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at the acquisition date fair values. Goodwill as of the acquisition date is measured as the excess of consideration transferred over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. 
 
 Our valuation of acquired assets and assumed liabilities requires estimates, especially with respect to intangible assets that was derived using valuation techniques and models such as the income approach. Such models require use of estimates including discount rates, and future expected revenue. The approach to estimating an initial contingent consideration associated with the purchase price also uses similar unobservable factors such as projected cash flows over the term of the contingent earn-out period, discounted for the period over which the initial contingent consideration is measured and expected volatility. Based upon these assumptions, the initial contingent consideration is then valued using a Monte Carlo simulation. 
 
 We have used third-party qualified specialists to assist management in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. This includes assistance with the determination of economic useful lives and valuation of identifiable intangibles. 
 
 We estimate the fair value based upon assumptions we believe to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from our estimates. Estimates associated with the accounting for acquisitions may change as additional information becomes available regarding the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. As a result, during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the business acquisition date, we record certain adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. 
 
 All acquisition-related costs are accounted for as expenses in the period in which they are incurred. Contingent consideration is remeasured each reporting period using Level 3 inputs, and the change in fair value, including accretion for the passage of time, is recognized in acquisition related costs in the consolidated statement of earnings. 
 
 Goodwill 
 
 We test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests if an event occurs, or circumstances change, that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. The Company performs an evaluation of goodwill, utilizing either a qualitative or quantitative impairment test. The annual test for impairment is conducted as of October 1. The Company s reporting units included in the assessment of potential goodwill impairment are the same as its operating segments. Goodwill is not amortized but is subject to periodic testing for impairment at the reporting unit level. 

24

Table of Contents 

In a qualitative assessment, we assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not (that is, a likelihood of more than 50 percent) that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill. If, after assessing the totality of events or circumstances, we determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then the quantitative goodwill impairment test is unnecessary. 
 
 If, after assessing the totality of events or circumstances, we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then we perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test. We may also elect the unconditional option to bypass the qualitative assessment for any reporting unit in any period and proceed directly to performing the quantitative goodwill impairment test. 
 
 In the quantitative impairment test, we compare the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired. Conversely, if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss shall be recognized in an amount equal to that excess, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. 
 
 Determining the fair value of a reporting unit is judgmental in nature and requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including net sales growth rates, gross profit margins, operating margins, discount rates and future market conditions, among others. Any changes in the judgments, estimates or assumptions used could produce significantly different results. 
 
 Intangible Assets 
 
 Intangible assets with determinable lives are amortized on a straight-line basis over their respective estimated useful lives, which is determined based on their expected period of benefit. Intangible assets are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. Determination of recoverability is based on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future undiscounted cash flows, an impairment loss is recorded for the excess of the asset s carrying amount over its fair value. In addition, each quarter, the Company evaluates whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining estimated useful life of each of these intangible assets. If the Company were to determine that a change to the remaining estimated useful life of an intangible asset was necessary, then the remaining carrying amount of the intangible asset would be amortized prospectively over that revised remaining useful life. 
 
 Income Taxes 
 
 The Company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance related to deferred tax assets. In the event the Company were to determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax assets in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period such determination was made. 
 
 Share-Based Payments 
 
 Under the fair value recognition provision, stock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. We make certain assumptions in order to value and expense our various share-based payment awards. In connection with our restricted stock programs we record the forfeitures when they occur. We review our valuation assumptions periodically and, as a result, we may change our valuation assumptions used to value stock-based awards granted in future periods. Such changes may lead to a significant change in the expense we recognize in connection with share-based payments.

Foreign Exchange 
 
 The Company s foreign currency exposure relates primarily to international transactions where the currency collected from customers can be different from the currency used to purchase the product. In cases where the Company is not able to create a natural hedge by maintaining offsetting asset and liability amounts in the same currency, it may enter into foreign exchange contracts, typically in the form of forward purchase agreements, to facilitate the hedging of foreign currency exposures to mitigate the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. These contracts generally have terms of no more than two months. The Company does not apply hedge accounting to these contracts and therefore the changes in fair value are recorded in earnings. The Company does not enter into foreign exchange contracts for trading purposes and the risk of loss on a foreign exchange contract is the risk of nonperformance by the counterparties, which the Company minimizes by limiting its counterparties to major financial institutions. The Company recognized an unrealized loss of approximately 0.1 million on contracts outstanding as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements 
 
 In November 2023, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2023-07 Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures . The amendments in this ASU are intended to improve reportable segment disclosure requirements primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. The Company adopted the update in the first quarter of 2024 and it did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.

We define adjusted gross billings as net sales in accordance with US GAAP, adjusted for the cost of sales related to sales where the Company is an agent. We provided a reconciliation of adjusted gross billings to net sales, which is the most directly comparable US GAAP measure. We use adjusted gross billings of product and services as a supplemental measure of our performance to gain insight into the volume of business generated by our business, and to analyze the changes to our accounts receivable and accounts payable. Our use of adjusted gross billings of product and services as analytical tools has limitations, and you should not consider them in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our financial results as reported under US GAAP. In addition, other companies, including companies in our industry, might calculate adjusted gross billings of product and services or similarly titled measures differently, which may reduce their usefulness as comparative measures.

We define adjusted EBITDA, as net income, plus provision for income taxes, depreciation, amortization, share-based compensation, interest, and acquisition related costs.

We use adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental measure of our performance to gain insight into our businesses profitability when compared to the prior year and our competitors. Adjusted EBITDA is also a component to our financial covenants in our credit facility. Our use of adjusted EBITDA has limitations, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our financial results as reported under US GAAP. In addition, other companies, including companies in our industry, might calculate adjusted EBITDA, or similarly titled measures differently, which may reduce their usefulness as comparative measures.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
 
 Smaller reporting companies are not required to provide the information required by this item. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures. We maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) that are designed to ensure that material information relating to us is made known to the officers who certify as to our financial reports and to other members of senior management and the Board of Directors. These disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports that are filed or submitted under the Exchange Act, are recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. 
 
 As required by Rule 13a-15(b) under the Exchange Act, our management carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report. This evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of various members of our management, including our Company s Chief Executive Officer (principal executive officer), Vice President and Chief Financial Officer (principal financial officer) and Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer (principal accounting officer). Based upon that evaluation, the Company s Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Accounting Officer concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective, as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report, to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including the Company s Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Accounting Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 
 As described above, on July 31, 2024, we completed the acquisition of DSS. SEC guidance permits management to omit an assessment of an acquired business internal control over financial reporting from management s assessment of internal control over financial reporting for a period not to exceed one year from date of acquisition. We are in the process of integrating DSS operations within our internal control structure. In executing this integration, we are analyzing, evaluating, and where necessary, making changes in controls and procedures related to the DSS business. Accordingly, management has excluded controls relating to DSS in this quarter s evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Except for the acquisition of DSS described above, there has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by Rule 13a-15(d) under the Exchange Act, that occurred during the three months ended September 30, 2024, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
