 Allowance for credit losses 
 We measure our allowance for credit losses using the current expected credit loss, or CECL, model, which is based upon historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts incorporating forward-looking information that affect the collectability of the reported amount. 
 The allowance for credit losses is a valuation account that is deducted from the related loans amortized cost basis in our condensed consolidated balance sheets. Our loans typically include commitments to fund incremental proceeds to borrowers over the life of the loan; these future funding commitments are also subject to the CECL model. The allowance for credit losses related to unfunded loan commitments is included in accounts payable, accrued liabilities and other liabilities in our condensed consolidated balance sheets. 
 Given the lack of historical loss data related to our loan portfolio, we estimate our expected losses using an analytical model that considers the likelihood of default and loss given default for each individual loan. This analytical model incorporates data from a third party database with historical loan loss information for commercial mortgage-backed securities, or CMBS, and CRE loans since 1998. Significant inputs to the model include certain loan specific data, such as loan to value, or LTV, property type, geographic location, occupancy, vintage year, remaining loan term, net operating income, expected timing and amounts of future loan fundings, and macroeconomic forecast assumptions, including the performance of CRE assets, unemployment rates, interest rates and other factors. We utilize the model to estimate credit losses over a reasonable and supportable economic forecast period of 12 months, followed by a straight-line reversion period of six months to average historical losses. Average historical losses are established using a population of third party historical loss data that approximates our portfolio as of the measurement date. We evaluate the estimated allowance for each of our loans individually and we consider our internal loan risk rating as the primary credit quality indicator underlying our assessment.

 Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in our 2023 Annual Report. 
 
 OVERVIEW (dollars in thousands, except share data) 
 We are a Maryland REIT. Our business strategy is focused on originating and investing in floating rate first mortgage loans that range from 15,000 to 75,000, secured by middle market and transitional CRE properties that have values up to 100,000. We define transitional CRE as commercial properties subject to redevelopment or repositioning activities that are expected to increase the value of the properties. 
 Tremont is registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended. We believe that Tremont provides us with significant experience and expertise in investing in middle market and transitional CRE. 
 We operate our business in a manner that is consistent with our qualification for taxation as a REIT under the IRC. As such, we generally are not subject to U.S. federal income tax, provided that we meet certain distribution and other requirements. We also operate our business in a manner that permits us to maintain our exemption from registration under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or the 1940 Act. 
 Factors Affecting Operating Results 
 Our results of operations are impacted by a number of factors and primarily depend on the interest income from our investments and the financing and other costs associated with our business. Our operating results are also impacted by general CRE market conditions and unanticipated defaults by our borrowers. For further information regarding the risks associated with our loan portfolio, see Note 3 to the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 and elsewhere in this Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and Part I, Item 1A, "Risk Factors" of our 2023 Annual Report. 
 Credit Risk . We are subject to the credit risk of our borrowers in connection with our investments. We seek to mitigate this risk by utilizing a comprehensive underwriting, diligence and investment selection process and by ongoing monitoring of our investments. Nevertheless, unanticipated credit losses could occur that may adversely impact our operating results. 
 Changes in Fair Value of our Assets . We generally intend to hold our investments for their contractual terms, unless repaid earlier by the borrowers. We evaluate the credit quality of each of our loans at least quarterly. If a loan is determined to be collateral dependent (because the repayment of the loan is expected to be provided substantially through the operation or sale of the underlying collateral property) and the borrower is experiencing financial difficulties, but foreclosure is not probable, we will record an allowance for credit losses by comparing the collateral's fair value to the amortized cost basis of the loan. For collateral-dependent loans for which foreclosure is probable, the related allowance for credit losses is determined using the fair value of the collateral compared to the loan's amortized cost. 
 Availability of Leverage and Equity . We use leverage to make additional investments that may increase our returns. We may not be able to obtain the expected amount of leverage we desire or its cost may exceed our expectation and, consequently, the returns generated from our investments may be reduced. Our ability to further grow our loan portfolio over time will depend, to a significant degree, upon our ability to obtain additional capital. However, our access to additional capital depends on many factors including the price at which our common shares trade relative to their book value and market lending conditions. See " Market Conditions" below. 
 Market Conditions . Heading into 2024, CRE investors seemed cautiously optimistic that inflation had peaked, that the U.S. economy was likely headed for a soft-landing and that the Federal Open Market Committee of the U.S. Federal Reserve, or the FOMC, was poised to reduce the federal funds rate by 125 to 150 basis points through a series of rate cuts in 2024. With the anticipation of lower interest rates in the future, investors delayed sale or refinancing decisions, which resulted in tepid CRE investment and transaction volume during the third quarter of 2024. In September 2024, citing progress toward its 2 inflation target, the FOMC lowered the targeted federal funds rate by 50 basis points, to a range of 4.75 to 5.00 , the first reduction since March 2020. This first rate cut in over four years by the FOMC provided CRE owners relief from the recent high borrowing costs and uncertainty regarding the timing and magnitude of future rate cuts. 
 16 

Table of Contents 

 The September federal funds rate cut and updated projections by the FOMC for future rate cuts has provided CRE investors a renewed sense of optimism that both financing and investment sale transaction activity will accelerate in the fourth quarter of 2024 and into 2025. With additional clarity on the intentions of the FOMC and the direction of future interest rates, CRE owners are better positioned to make sale or refinance decisions and opt between floating or fixed rate financing options. CRE owners are also now more likely to qualify for new financing, instead of having to sell properties at distressed prices, to repay debt. Borrowers with well performing cash flowing properties will continue to benefit from numerous financing options. 
 The CMBS financing market, a key provider of debt liquidity to the CRE industry, has seen increased activity through the first half of 2024. Strong demand from bond buyers has allowed borrowers to take advantage of tightening credit spreads for 10-year and 5-year loans, the latter of which has become more popular among bond investors and borrowers. Life insurance companies continue to expand their product offerings to borrowers, with low leverage, fixed rate term debt for stabilized assets as well as floating rate capital for more transitional properties, which were once reserved for banks and alternative lenders, like us. The banking sector continues to be impacted by legacy CRE exposure and increased capital charges imposed by regulators but have become more active of late, primary for new loans to strategic, long-term clients. Agency lenders, Fannie-Mae and Freddie-Mac continue to be active lenders in the market; however, they are facing increased competition from CMBS/conduit providers, life-insurance companies and alternative lenders, like us. Overall, the debt capital markets remain liquid, and lenders continue to compete for quality financing opportunities. 
 Although CRE investors feel that the risk of a prolonged period of elevated interest rates is largely over, other challenges remain ahead. Special servicing rates for CMBS and CRE-CLO financed loans continue to increase and lenders have become more willing to foreclose on borrowers unable to support underperforming properties. Furthermore, certain segments of the CRE industry continue to experience a deterioration in operating fundamentals. The U.S. office market continues to suffer from the post pandemic shift in work habits and weak demand for office space. Retail assets, particularly needs based and grocery anchored retail, have benefited from a strong consumer and employment market, but recent reports of declining retail sales and weakening consumer demand may eventually have an impact on the performance of retail assets. The industrial sector remains a preferred asset class among lenders and investors, but oversupply in certain markets and more measured corporate demand have impacted the pace of rent growth. The lack of affordable housing in the United States and the rent versus own dynamic continue to favor the apartment sector. Oversupply in certain markets, however, has caused a slowdown, and in some markets a decline, in rent growth. For most markets, it is expected that the imbalance between supply and demand will be short lived and once they reach equilibrium, rent growth will return. 
 Over 2 trillion in CRE debt is scheduled to mature over the next two years. These maturities, coupled with a lower and more stabilized interest rate environment, are likely to provide investors with greater investment opportunities which will spurn lending activity. Looking forward, geopolitical uncertainty and the impact of the U.S. presidential election may pose additional risks to the CRE industry, however, we believe that the CRE lending market remains well positioned to handle these challenges. 
 Changes in Interest Rates. With respect to our business operations, increases in interest rates, in general, may cause: (a) the coupon rates on our variable rate investments to reset, perhaps on a delayed basis, to higher rates; (b) it to become more difficult and costly for our borrowers, which may negatively impact their ability to repay our investments; and (c) the interest expense associated with our variable rate borrowings to increase. 
 Conversely, decreases in interest rates, in general, may cause: (a) the coupon rates on our variable rate investments to reset, perhaps on a delayed basis, to lower rates; (b) it to become easier and more affordable for our borrowers to refinance, and as a result, repay our loans, but may negatively impact our future returns if any such repayment proceeds were to be reinvested in lower yielding investments; and (c) the interest expense associated with our variable rate borrowings to decrease. See " Market Conditions" above for a discussion of the current market including interest rates. 
 The interest income on our loans and interest expense on our borrowings float with benchmark rates, such as SOFR. Because we generally intend to leverage approximately 75 of the amount of our investments, as benchmark rates increase above the floors of our loans, our income from investments, net of interest and related expenses, will increase. Decreases in benchmark rates are mitigated by interest rate floor provisions in all but one of our loan agreements with borrowers, ranging from 0.10 to 5.20 ; therefore, changes to income from investments, net, may not move proportionately with the increase or decrease in benchmark rates. As of September 30, 2024, SOFR was 4.85 , and as a result, one of our loan investments currently has an active interest rate floor.

 Size of Portfolio . The size of our loan portfolio, as measured both by the aggregate principal balance and the number of our CRE loans and our other investments, is also an important factor in determining our operating results. Generally, if the size of our loan portfolio grows, the amount of interest income we receive would increase and we may achieve certain economies of scale and diversify risk within our loan portfolio. A larger portfolio, however, may result in increased expenses; for example, we may incur additional interest expense or other costs to finance our investments. Also, if the aggregate principal balance of our loan portfolio grows but the number of our loans or the number of our borrowers does not grow, we could face increased risk by reason of the concentration of our investments. 
 Prepayment Risk. We are subject to risk that our loan investments will be repaid at an earlier date than anticipated, which may reduce the returns realized on those loans as less interest income may be received over time. Additionally, we may not be able to reinvest the principal repaid at a similar or higher yield of the original loan investment. We seek to limit this risk by structuring our loan agreements with fees required to be paid to us upon prepayment of a loan within a specified period of time before the loan s maturity; however, unanticipated prepayments could negatively impact our operating results. 
 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 We present Distributable Earnings, Distributable Earnings per common share and Adjusted Book Value per common share, which are considered non-GAAP financial measures within the meaning of the applicable SEC rules. These non-GAAP financial measures do not represent net income, net income per common share or cash generated from operating activities and should not be considered as alternatives to net income or net income per common share determined in accordance with GAAP or as an indication of our cash flows from operations determined in accordance with GAAP, a measure of our liquidity or operating performance or an indication of funds available for our cash needs. In addition, our methodologies for calculating these non-GAAP financial measures may differ from the methodologies employed by other companies to calculate the same or similar supplemental performance measures; therefore, our reported Distributable Earnings and Distributable Earnings per common share may not be comparable to distributable earnings and distributable earnings per common share as reported by other companies. 
 We believe that Adjusted Book Value per common share is a meaningful measure of our capital adequacy because it excludes the impact of certain non-cash estimates or adjustments, including the unaccreted purchase discount resulting from the excess of the fair value of the loans Tremont Mortgage Trust, or TRMT, then held for investment and that we acquired as a result of our merger with TRMT on September 30, 2021, or the Merger, over the consideration we paid in the Merger and our allowance for credit losses for our loan portfolio and unfunded loan commitments. Adjusted Book Value per common share does not represent book value per common share or alternative measures determined in accordance with GAAP. Our methodology for calculating Adjusted Book Value per common share may differ from the methodologies employed by other companies to calculate the same or similar supplemental capital adequacy measures; therefore, our Adjusted Book Value per common share may not be comparable to the adjusted book value per common share reported by other companies. 
 In order to maintain our qualification for taxation as a REIT, we are generally required to distribute substantially all of our taxable income, subject to certain adjustments, to our shareholders. We believe that one of the factors that investors consider important in deciding whether to buy or sell securities of a REIT is its distribution rate. Over time, Distributable Earnings and Distributable Earnings per common share may be useful indicators of distributions to our shareholders and are measures that are considered by our Board of Trustees when determining the amount of distributions. We believe that Distributable Earnings and Distributable Earnings per common share provide meaningful information to consider in addition to net income, net income per common share and cash flows from operating activities determined in accordance with GAAP. These measures help us to evaluate our performance excluding the effects of certain transactions and GAAP adjustments that we believe are not necessarily indicative of our current loan portfolio and operations. In addition, Distributable Earnings, excluding incentive fees, is used in determining the amount of base management and management incentive fees payable by us to Tremont under our management agreement.

 Distributable Earnings 
 We calculate Distributable Earnings and Distributable Earnings per common share as net income and net income per common share, respectively, computed in accordance with GAAP, including realized losses not otherwise included in net income determined in accordance with GAAP, and excluding: (a) depreciation and amortization of real estate owned and related intangible assets, if any; (b) non-cash equity compensation expense; (c) unrealized gains, losses and other similar non-cash items that are included in net income for the period of the calculation (regardless of whether such items are included in or deducted from net income or in other comprehensive income under GAAP), if any; and (d) one-time events pursuant to changes in GAAP and certain non-cash items, if any. Distributable Earnings are reduced for realized losses on loan investments when amounts are deemed uncollectable. This is generally at the time a loan is repaid, or in the case of foreclosure, when the real estate assets are acquired, but may also be when, in our determination, it is nearly certain that all amounts due will not be collected. The realized loss amount reflected in Distributable Earnings will equal the difference between the cash or fair value of the assets received or expected to be received and the carrying value of the loan. 
 Adjusted Book Value per Common Share 
 The table below calculates our book value per common share:

 0.63 0.40 Adjusted Book Value per common share 18.71 18.87 
 (1) Excludes the impact of the unaccreted purchase discount resulting from the excess of the fair value of the loans TRMT then held for investment and that we acquired as a result of the Merger over the consideration we paid in the Merger. The purchase discount of 36,443 was allocated to each acquired loan and was accreted into income over the remaining term of the respective loan. As of September 30, 2024, the purchase discount was fully accreted. As of December 31, 2023, the unaccreted purchase discount was 2,347. 
 (2) Excludes the impact of our allowance for credit losses. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, our allowance for credit losses for our loan portfolio and unfunded loan commitments was 9,358 and 5,828, respectively.

 As of September 30, 2024 and October 24, 2024, all of our borrowers had paid their debt service obligations owed and due to us. 
 We did not have any outstanding past due loans or nonaccrual loans as of September 30, 2024. However, our borrowers' businesses, operations and liquidity may be materially adversely impacted by current inflationary pressures, interest rate fluctuations, supply chain issues or a prolonged economic slowdown or recession could amplify those negative impacts. As a result, they may become unable to pay their debt service obligations owed and due to us, which may result in an increased allowance for credit losses and/or recognition of income on a nonaccrual basis.

 Interest and related income . The decrease in interest and related income was primarily the result of a lower average outstanding principal balance for our loan investment portfolio as a result of loan repayments and a prepayment premium received during the three months ended June 30, 2024. The weighted average aggregate principal balance of our loan investments was approximately 581,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to approximately 601,000 for the three months ended June 30, 2024. 
 Purchase discount accretion. The decrease in purchase discount accretion was primarily due to the purchase discount recorded as part of the Merger becoming fully accreted during the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Interest and related expenses. The decrease in interest and related expenses was primarily the result of lower outstanding principal balances under our Secured Financing Facilities as a result of loan repayments during the three months ended September 30, 2024. The weighted average principal balance was approximately 393,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to approximately 422,000 for the three months ended June 30, 2024. 
 Revenue from real estate owned. Revenue from real estate owned represents revenue from the operations of an office property located in Yardley, PA that was transferred to real estate owned through a deed in lieu of foreclosure in June 2023. 
 Incentive fees. We recognize management incentive fees payable to Tremont in accordance with our management agreement. The increase in management incentive fees was due to higher "core earnings," as defined in our management agreement, for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended June 30, 2024. 
 General and administrative expenses . The decrease in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to a decrease in share based compensation resulting from shares awarded to our Trustees during the three months ended June 30, 2024. 
 Reimbursement of shared services expenses. Reimbursement of shared services expenses represents reimbursement of the costs for the services that Tremont arranges on our behalf from RMR. The decrease in reimbursement of shared services expenses was primarily the result of an adjustment to our estimate of costs for the usage of shared services from RMR during the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Provision for credit losses. The provision for credit losses represents the increase in the allowance for credit losses on our loan portfolio and unfunded commitments. The increase in the allowance for credit losses during the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily attributable to declining values for CRE and unfavorable CRE pricing forecasts used in our CECL model and increased provisions for our office loans. 
 Expenses from real estate owned. Expenses from real estate owned represent expenses from the operations of an office property located in Yardley, PA that was transferred to real estate owned through a deed in lieu of foreclosure in June 2023. The increase in expenses from real estate owned was primarily due to increases in maintenance expenses. 
 Income tax expense. Income tax expense represents income taxes paid or payable by us in certain jurisdictions where we are subject to state income taxes. 
 Net income. The decrease in net income was due to the changes noted above.

 Provision for (reversal of) credit losses. The provision for (reversal of) credit losses represents the increase in the allowance for credit losses on our loan portfolio and unfunded commitments. The increase in the allowance for credit losses during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily attributable to declining values for CRE and unfavorable CRE pricing forecasts used in our CECL model and increased provisions for our office loans. 
 Expenses from real estate owned. Expenses from real estate owned represent expenses from the operations of an office property located in Yardley, PA that was transferred to real estate owned through a deed in lieu of foreclosure in June 2023. 
 Income tax expense. Income tax expense represents income taxes paid or payable by us in certain jurisdictions where we are subject to state income taxes. 
 Net income. The decrease in net income was due to the changes noted above. 
 Reconciliation of Net Income to Distributable Earnings 
 The table below demonstrates how we calculate Distributable Earnings and Distributable Earnings per common share, which are non-GAAP measures, and provides a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to net income: 
 Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 June 30, 2024 September 30, 2024 September 30, 2023 Net income 3,479 4,229 12,941 19,920 Non-cash equity compensation expense 367 497 1,200 970 Non-cash accretion of purchase discount (420) (782) (2,347) (3,307) Provision for credit losses 
 1,518 1,315 3,530 (1,299) Depreciation and amortization of real estate owned 307 305 969 305 Exit fees collected on loans acquired in Merger (1) 
 34 124 Distributable Earnings 5,285 5,564 16,417 16,589 Weighted average common shares outstanding - basic and diluted 14,723 14,691 14,697 14,609 Net income per common share - basic and diluted 0.23 0.28 0.87 1.35 Distributable Earnings per common share - basic and diluted 0.36 0.38 1.12 1.14 
 (1) Exit fees collected on loans acquired in the Merger represent fees collected upon repayment of loans for which no income has previously been recognized in Distributable Earnings. In accordance with GAAP, exit fees payable with respect to loans acquired in the Merger were accreted as a component of the purchase discount and were excluded from Distributable Earnings as a non-cash item. Accordingly, these exit fees have been recognized in Distributable Earnings upon collection.

 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES (dollars in thousands, except per share data) 
 Liquidity is a measure of our ability to meet potential cash requirements, including ongoing commitments to fund our lending commitments, repay or meet margin calls resulting from our borrowings, if any, fund and maintain our assets and operations, make distributions to our shareholders and fund other business operating requirements. Our sources of cash flows include cash on hand, payments of principal, interest and fees we receive on our investments, other cash we may generate from our business and operations, any unused borrowing capacity, including under our Secured Financing Facilities or other repurchase agreements or financing arrangements we may obtain, which may also include bank loans or public or private issuances of debt or equity securities, and proceeds from any sale of real estate owned. We believe that these sources of funds will be sufficient to meet our operating and capital expenses, pay our debt service obligations owed and make any distributions to our shareholders for the next 12 months and for the foreseeable future. For further information regarding the risks associated with our loan portfolio, see Note 3 to our Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 and elsewhere in this Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and Part I, Item 1A, "Risk Factors" of our 2023 Annual Report. 
 Pursuant to the terms of our Citibank Master Repurchase Facility, our UBS Master Repurchase Facility and Wells Fargo Master Repurchase Facility, we may sell to, and later repurchase from, UBS, Citibank and Wells Fargo, the purchased assets related to the applicable facility. The initial purchase price paid by UBS of each purchased asset is up to 80 of the lesser of the market value of the purchased asset or the unpaid principal balance of such purchased asset, subject to UBS's approval. The initial purchase price paid by Citibank of each purchased asset is up to 75 of the lesser of the market value of the purchased asset or the unpaid principal balance of such purchased asset, subject to Citibank's approval. The initial purchase price paid by Wells Fargo for each purchased asset is up to 75 or 80 , depending on the property type of the purchased asset s real estate collateral, of the lesser of the market value of the purchased asset or the unpaid principal balance of such purchased asset, and subject to Wells Fargo s approval. Upon the repurchase of a purchased asset, we are required to pay UBS, Citibank or Wells Fargo, as applicable, the outstanding purchase price of the purchased asset, accrued interest and all accrued and unpaid expenses of UBS, Citibank or Wells Fargo, as applicable, relating to such purchased asset. 
 The interest rates related to our Citibank, UBS and Wells Fargo purchased assets are calculated at SOFR plus a premium within a fixed range, determined by the debt yield and property type of the purchased asset s real estate collateral. Citibank has the discretion to make advancements at margins higher than 75 , and UBS and Wells Fargo each have discretion to make advancements higher than 80 . 
 Loans issued under the BMO Facility are coterminous with the corresponding pledged mortgage loan investments, are not subject to margin calls and allow for up to an 80 advance rate, subject to certain loan to cost and LTV limits. Interest on advancements under the BMO Facility are calculated at SOFR plus a premium. Loans issued under the BMO Facility are secured by a security interest and collateral assignment of the underlying loans to our borrowers which are secured by real property underlying such loans. We are required to pay an upfront fee equal to a percentage of the aggregate amount of the facility loan, such percentage to be determined at the time of approval of the separate facility loan agreements with BMO, or the BMO Facility Loan Agreements. 
 For further information regarding our Secured Financing Facilities, see Note 5 to our Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1, of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 The table below is a summary of our sources and uses of cash flows for the periods presented: 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Cash and cash equivalents at beginning of period 87,855 71,067 Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities 16,269 14,944 Investing activities 73,540 (10,702) Financing activities (95,467) (14,779) Cash and cash equivalents at end of period 82,197 60,530 
 26 

Table of Contents 

 The increase in cash provided by operating activities for the 2024 period compared to the 2023 period was primarily the result of increased interest income earned on cash balances invested and a prepayment premium received in the 2024 period. The increase in cash provided by investing activities was primarily due to increased loan repayments and decreased loan originations in the 2024 period. The decrease in cash used in financing activities was primarily due to increased repayments and lower proceeds from our Secured Financing Facilities in the 2024 period. 
 Distributions 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we declared and paid regular quarterly distributions to our common shareholders totaling 15,556, or 1.05 per common share, using cash on hand. 
 On October 16, 2024, we declared a regular quarterly distribution of 0.35 per common share, or 5,216, to shareholders of record on October 28, 2024. We expect to pay this distribution to our common shareholders on or about November 14, 2024 using cash on hand. 
 For further information regarding distributions, see Note 7 to our Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 Contractual Obligations and Commitments 
 Our contractual obligations and commitments as of September 30, 2024 were as follows: 
 Payment Due by Period Total Less than 1 Year 1 - 3 Years 3 - 5 Years More than 5 years Unfunded loan commitments (1) 
 36,876 27,462 9,414 Principal payments on Secured Financing Facilities (2) 
 377,334 312,532 64,802 Interest payments on Secured Financing Facilities (3) 
 19,700 14,069 5,631 Lease related costs (4) 
 228 228 434,138 354,291 79,847 
 (1) The allocation of our unfunded loan commitments is based on the current loan maturity date to which the individual commitments relate. 
 (2) The allocation of outstanding advancements under our Secured Financing Facilities is based on the earlier of the current maturity date of each loan investment with respect to which the individual borrowing relates or the maturity date of the respective Secured Financing Facilities. 
 (3) Projected interest payments are attributable only to our debt service obligations at existing rates as of September 30, 2024 and are not intended to estimate future interest costs which may result from debt prepayments, additional borrowings, new debt issuances or changes in interest rates. 
 (4) Lease related costs include capital expenditures used to improve tenants' spaces pursuant to lease agreements or leasing related costs, such as brokerage commissions, related to the Yardley, PA property. 
 Debt Covenants 
 Our principal debt obligations as of September 30, 2024 were the outstanding balances under our Secured Financing Facilities. The agreements governing our Master Repurchase Facilities, or our Master Repurchase Agreements, provide for acceleration of the date of repurchase of any then purchased assets and the liquidation of the purchased assets by UBS, Citibank or Wells Fargo, as applicable, upon the occurrence and continuation of certain events of default, including a change of control of us, which includes Tremont ceasing to act as our sole manager or to be a wholly owned subsidiary of RMR. Our Master Repurchase Agreements also provide that upon the repurchase of any then purchased asset, we are required to pay UBS, Citibank or Wells Fargo the outstanding purchase price of such purchased asset and accrued interest and any and all accrued and unpaid expenses of UBS, Citibank or Wells Fargo, as applicable, relating to such purchased asset. 
 In connection with our Master Repurchase Agreements, we entered into our guarantees, or the Master Repurchase Guarantees, which require us to guarantee 25 of the aggregate repurchase price and 100 of losses in the event of certain bad acts, as well as any costs and expenses of UBS, Citibank and Wells Fargo, as applicable, related to our Master Repurchase Agreements. The Master Repurchase Guarantees contain financial covenants, which require us to maintain a minimum tangible net worth, a minimum liquidity and a minimum interest coverage ratio and to satisfy a total indebtedness to stockholders' equity ratio.

Table of Contents 

 In connection with our facility loan program agreement and the security agreement with BMO, or the BMO Loan Program Agreement, we have agreed to guarantee certain of the obligations under the BMO Loan Program Agreement and the BMO Facility Loan Agreements pursuant to a limited guaranty from us to and for the benefit of the administrative agent for itself and such other lenders, or the BMO Guaranty. Specifically, the BMO Guaranty requires us to guarantee 25 of the then current outstanding principal balance of the facility loans and 100 of losses or the entire indebtedness in the event of certain bad acts as well as any costs and expenses of the administrative agent or lenders related to the BMO Loan Program Agreement. In addition, the BMO Guaranty contains financial covenants that require us to maintain a minimum tangible net worth and a minimum liquidity and to satisfy a total indebtedness to stockholders equity ratio. Our BMO Loan Program Agreement provides for acceleration of all payment obligations due under the BMO Facility Loan Agreements upon the occurrence and continuation of certain events of default, including a change of control of us, which includes Tremont ceasing to act as our sole manager or to be a wholly owned subsidiary of RMR. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had a 273,479 aggregate outstanding principal balance under our Master Repurchase Facilities. Our Master Repurchase Agreements are structured with risk mitigation mechanisms, including a cash flow sweep, which would allow UBS, Citibank and Wells Fargo, as applicable, to control interest payments from our borrowers under our loans that are financed under our respective Master Repurchase Facilities, and the ability to accelerate dates of repurchase and institute margin calls, which may require us to pay down balances associated with one or more of our loans that are financed under our Master Repurchase Facilities. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had a 103,855 aggregate outstanding principal balance under the BMO Facility. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with all covenants and other terms under our Secured Financing Facilities. 
 Related Person Transactions 
 We have relationships and historical and continuing transactions with Tremont, RMR, RMR Inc. and others related to them. For further information about these and other such relationships and related person transactions, see Notes 8 and 9 to the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, our 2023 Annual Report, our definitive Proxy Statement for our 2024 Annual Meeting of Shareholders and our other filings with the SEC. In addition, see the section captioned Risk Factors of our 2023 Annual Report for a description of risks that may arise as a result of these and other related person transactions and relationships.
