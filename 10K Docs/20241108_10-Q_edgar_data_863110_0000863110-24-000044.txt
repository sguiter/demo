In a rate order issued by the DEPSC, the Company was directed effective June 12, 2024, to begin using revised depreciation rates for utility plant in Artesian Water, which are based on the estimated useful life years noted in the table above. Artesian Water offsets depreciation recorded on utility plant by depreciation on utility property funded by Contributions in Aid of Construction, or CIAC, and Advances for Construction, or Advances. This reduction in depreciation expense is also netted against outstanding CIAC and Advances on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. Certain other deferred assets are amortized using the straight-line method over applicable lives, which range from to years.

The final million installment payment is due no later than July 2025. Artesian Water received approval from the DEPSC in October 2022 to refund to its customers these reimbursements for past capital and operating costs. The refund for the reimbursements will be applied to current and future customer bills in annual installments. The first refunds occurred in October 2022, August 2023 and August 2024. The final customer refund will occur no later than August 2025. The amount of the credit will be calculated by dividing the amount of the reimbursement by the number of eligible customers. Beginning in 2022, Artesian Water began recording 2022 and future recovery of capital expenditures as Contributions in Aid of Construction and began recording expense recovery as an offset to operations and maintenance expense, with the intention that those recoveries will be available for inclusion and consideration in any future rate applications.

 to (see Note 7 Income Taxes resulting in a decrease in the net deferred income tax liability of million, of which million was reclassified to a regulatory liability related to Artesian Water and Artesian Water Maryland. The regulatory liability amount is subject to certain Internal Revenue Service normalization rules that require the benefits to customers be spread over the remaining useful life of the underlying assets giving rise to the associated deferred income taxes. On January 31, 2019, the DEPSC approved Artesian Water to amortize the regulatory liability amount of million over a period of years beginning February 1, 2018, subject to audit at a later date. In May 2022, Artesian Water received a rate order from the DEPSC instructing Artesian Water to continue amortizing the liability over a period of years, subject to review in Artesian Water s next base rate filing. On June 12, 2024, the DEPSC approved a settlement agreement for the Artesian Water rate application, filed on April 28, 2023, that required two changes to the deferred income tax regulatory liability effective June 12, 2024. A million gross-up adjustment was recorded to reflect the benefit customers would receive from the implementation of new base rates and million of the regulatory liability, which represents costs not subject to IRS normalization rules, is now required to be amortized over a period rather than years. The MDPSC has not issued a final order on the regulatory liability amount of million regarding the effects of the TCJA on Maryland customers.

If any such rates are found to be in excess of rates the DEPSC finds to be appropriate, the utility must refund customers the portion found to be in excess with interest. The timing of our rate increase requests is therefore dependent upon the estimated cost of the administrative process in relation to the investments and expenses that we hope to recover through the rate increase. We can provide no assurances that rate increase requests will be approved by applicable regulatory agencies and, if approved, we cannot guarantee that these rate increases will be granted in a timely or sufficient manner to cover the investments and expenses for which we initially sought the rate increase.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE PERIOD ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2024

OVERVIEW

Our profitability is primarily attributable to the sale of water and wastewater services in our regulated utility business. Our regulated utility segment comprised 93.6 of total operating revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 93.2 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Water sales are subject to seasonal fluctuations, particularly during summer when water demand may vary with rainfall and temperature. In the event temperatures during the typically warmer months are cooler than expected or rainfall is greater than expected, the demand for water may decrease and our revenues may be adversely affected. We believe these effects of weather are short term and do not materially affect the execution of our strategic initiatives. Our wastewater services provide a revenue stream that is not affected by these changes in weather patterns. We continue to seek growth opportunities to provide wastewater services in Delaware and the surrounding areas.

Our profitability is also attributed to other non-utility business, such as various contract operations, SLP Plans and other services we provide. Our contract operations, SLP Plans and other services also provide a revenue stream that is not affected by changes in weather patterns. We also continue to explore and develop relationships with developers and municipalities in order to increase revenues from contract water and wastewater operations, wastewater management services, and design, construction and engineering services. We plan to continue developing and expanding our contract operations and other services in a manner that complements our growth in water service to new customers. Our anticipated growth in these areas is subject to changes in residential and commercial construction, which may be affected by interest rates, inflation and general housing and economic market conditions. We anticipate continued growth in our non-utility subsidiaries mostly due to our SLP Plans.

Table of Contents 

Inflation

We are affected by inflation, most notably by the continually increasing costs required to maintain, improve and expand our service capability. The cumulative effect of inflation results in significantly higher facility replacement costs as well as increased operating costs, which must be recovered from future cash flows. Our ability to recover increases in investments in facilities and operating costs is dependent upon future rate increases, which are subject to approval by the applicable regulatory authority. We can provide no assurances that any future rate increase request will be approved, and if approved, we cannot guarantee that any rate increase will be granted in a timely manner and/or will be sufficient in amount to cover costs for which we initially sought the rate increase. The impact of inflation could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position or cash flows.

Regulated Water Subsidiaries

Artesian Water, Artesian Water Maryland and Artesian Water Pennsylvania provide water service to residential, commercial, industrial, governmental, municipal and utility customers. Increases in the number of customers contribute to increases, or help to offset any intermittent decreases, in our operating revenue. As of September 30, 2024, the number of metered water customers in Delaware increased approximately 1.5 compared to September 30, 2023. The number of metered water customers in Maryland increased approximately 2.4 compared to September 30, 2023. The number of metered water customers in Pennsylvania remained consistent compared to September 30, 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, approximately 7.1 billion gallons of water were distributed in our Delaware systems and approximately 83.2 million gallons of water were distributed in our Maryland systems.

Artesian Water filed an initial request with the DEPSC on April 28, 2023, further supplemented with a request filed on November 30, 2023, to implement new rates to meet a requested increase in revenue of approximately 16.7 million, on an annualized basis, or 22.7 . Temporary rates of approximately 10.8 million, on an annualized basis, or 14.6 , that were in effect since November 28, 2023 were replaced with the final approved rates pursuant to a DEPSC order that authorized a total increase in water sales revenue of 11.2 million on an annualized basis, or approximately 15.2 , with a rate effective date of June 12, 2024. In addition, on June 12, 2024, the DEPSC approved Artesian Water s application to implement a DSIC rate of 0.34 , effective July 1, 2024. The previous DSIC rate of 7.50 was reset to zero when the temporary base rate increase was placed into effect on November 28, 2023. This is discussed further in Note 13 Regulatory Proceedings. 

Regulated Wastewater Subsidiaries

Artesian Wastewater and TESI own wastewater collection and treatment infrastructure and provide regulated wastewater services to customers in Sussex County, Delaware. Artesian Wastewater Maryland is able to provide regulated wastewater services to customers in Maryland. It is not currently providing these services in Maryland. The majority of our residential and commercial wastewater customers are billed a flat monthly fee, and our large industrial wastewater customer is billed monthly based on wastewater flow, which contributes to providing a revenue stream unaffected by weather. As of September 30, 2024, the number of Delaware wastewater customers increased approximately 6.4 compared to September 30, 2023.

Non-Utility Subsidiaries

Artesian Utility provides contract water and wastewater operation services to private, municipal, and governmental institutions. Artesian Utility also offers three protection plans to customers, the WSLP Plan, the SSLP Plan, and the ISLP Plan. SLP Plan customers are billed a flat monthly or quarterly rate, which contributes to providing a revenue stream unaffected by weather. There has been consistent customer growth over the years. As of September 30, 2024, customers enrolled in the WSLP Plan, the SSLP Plan and the ISLP Plan increased 3.3 , 2.4 and 1.6 , respectively, compared to September 30, 2023.

Strategic Direction and Recent Developments

Our strategy is to increase customer growth, revenues, earnings and dividends by expanding our water, wastewater and SLP Plan services across the Delmarva Peninsula. We remain focused on providing superior service to our customers and continuously seek ways to improve our efficiency and performance. Our strategy has included a focus on building strategic partnerships with county governments, municipalities and developers. By providing water and wastewater services, we believe we are positioned as the primary resource for developers and communities throughout the Delmarva Peninsula seeking to fill both needs simultaneously. We believe we have a proven ability to acquire and integrate high growth, reputable entities, through which we have captured additional service territories that will serve as a base for future revenue. We believe this experience presents a strong platform for further expansion and that our success to date also produces positive relationships and credibility with regulators, municipalities, developers and customers in both existing and prospective service areas.

In our regulated water subsidiaries, our strategy is to focus on a wide spectrum of activities, which include strategic acquisitions of existing systems, expanding certificated service area, identifying new and dependable sources of supply, developing the wells, treatment plants and delivery systems to supply water to customers and educating customers on the wise use of water. Our strategy includes focused efforts to expand through strategic acquisitions and in new regions added to our Delaware service territory over the last 10 years. We plan to expand our regulated water service area in the Cecil County designated growth corridor and to expand our business through the design, construction, operation, management and acquisition of additional water systems. The expansion of our exclusive franchise areas elsewhere in Maryland and the award of contracts will similarly enhance our operations within the state.

Our ability to develop partnerships with various county governments, municipalities and developers has provided a number of opportunities. In the last four years, we completed seven acquisitions including asset purchase agreements with municipal and developer/homeowner association operated systems.

We believe that Delaware's generally lower cost of living in the region and availability of development sites in relatively close proximity to the Atlantic Ocean in Sussex County have resulted, and will continue to result, in increases to our customer base. Delaware s lower property and income tax rate make it an attractive region for new home development and retirement communities. Substantial portions of Delaware currently are not served by a public water system, which could also assist in an increase to our customer base as systems are added.

In our regulated wastewater subsidiaries, we foresee significant growth opportunities and will continue to seek strategic partnerships and relationships with developers and governmental agencies to complement existing agreements for the provision of wastewater service on the Delmarva Peninsula. There are numerous locations in Sussex County where Artesian Wastewater s and Sussex County s facilities are connected or integrated to allow for the movement and disposal of wastewater generated by one or the other s system in a manner that most efficiently and cost effectively manages wastewater transmission, treatment and disposal. In addition, Artesian Wastewater plans to utilize our larger regional wastewater facilities to expand service areas to new customers while transitioning our smaller treatment facilities into regional pump stations in order to gain additional efficiencies in the treatment and disposal of wastewater. We believe this will reduce operational costs at the smaller treatment facilities in the future because they will be converted from treatment and disposal plants to pump stations to assist with transitioning the flow of wastewater from one regional facility to another. In addition, Artesian s Delaware wastewater subsidiaries are the sole regional regulated wastewater utilities in Delaware, which we believe will enable us to increase efficiencies in the treatment and disposal of wastewater and provide additional opportunities to expand our wastewater operations.

In April 2024, Artesian Wastewater received a permit from the Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control for and has commenced construction of a 625,000 gallon per day regional wastewater treatment facility, including a primary receiving headworks at its Sussex Regional Recharge Facility, or SRRF. Under its previous permit, SRRF provided solely land disposal services for a single commercial processing and treatment plant. Under its new permit, SRRF will continue providing those disposal services alongside the new treatment plant. The new treatment facility will provide service for Artesian Wastewater s regional system comprised primarily of residential and small commercial customers. The construction will also include the primary receiving facility for untreated effluent, sized to allow for the expansion of the regional treatment system planned for the site. The new treatment facility will utilize the existing disposal infrastructure.

The general need for increased capital investment in our water and wastewater systems is due to a combination of population growth, more protective water quality standards, aging infrastructure and acquisitions. Our planned and budgeted capital improvements over the next three years include projects for water infrastructure improvements and expansion in both Delaware and Maryland and wastewater infrastructure improvements and expansion in Delaware. The DEPSC and MDPSC have generally recognized the operating and capital costs associated with these improvements in setting water and wastewater rates for current customers and capacity charges for new customers.

In our non-utility subsidiaries, we continue pursuing opportunities to expand our contract operations. Through Artesian Utility, we will seek to expand our contract design, engineering and construction services of water and wastewater facilities for developers, municipalities and other utilities. We also anticipate continued growth due to our water, sewer and internal SLP Plans. Artesian Development owns two nine-acre parcels of land, located in Sussex County, Delaware, which allows for construction of a water treatment facility and wastewater treatment facility.

Other Matters

Environmental, Health and Safety, and Water Quality Regulation 

As required by the Safe Drinking Water Act, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, or EPA, establishes maximum contaminant levels, or MCLs, for various substances found in drinking water to ensure that the water is safe for human consumption. On April 10, 2024, the EPA established MCLs for certain per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS, in drinking water. Water utilities will be required to complete initial monitoring for PFAS by 2027 and to conduct ongoing compliance monitoring. Water utilities also will be required to meet the new MCLs by April 2029 and to notify the public of any violations of the MCLs as of and after that date. The Company has installed treatment for PFAS at several wellfields to date and has included installation of treatment at additional locations in 2024 in its capital budget, with any remaining necessary treatment planned to be installed before 2029. The capital investment and operating costs for treatment of PFAS are anticipated to be recoverable in water rates charged to customers as approved by the applicable public service commission. The Company is participating in the multi-district litigation class action settlements with certain manufacturers of PFAS seeking reimbursement of costs incurred and that will continue to be incurred. See Note 16 Legal Proceedings.

The Lead and Copper Rule, or LCR, is a federal regulation that limits the concentration of lead and copper allowed in public drinking water at the consumer's tap, in addition to limiting the permissible amount of pipe corrosion occurring due to the water itself. The LCR limits the levels of lead and copper in water by improving water treatment, testing for lead and copper at customer taps, and eliminating the water supply as a significant source of lead and copper. The EPA published a revised LCR in 2021, or LCR Revisions, to provide greater and more effective protection of public health by reducing exposure to lead and copper in drinking water. Implementation of the revised rule is intended to better identify high levels of lead, improve the reliability of lead tap sampling results, strengthen corrosion control treatment requirements, expand consumer awareness and improve risk communication. In addition, implementation of the revised rule is anticipated to accelerate lead service line replacements by closing existing regulatory loopholes, propelling early action, and strengthening replacement requirements. We have filed all required Lead Service Line Inventories by the October 16, 2024 deadline and are fully compliant with the LCR Revisions.

On October, 8, 2024, the EPA announced the new final regulations requiring the removal of lead water lines. The EPA s rule, known as the Lead and Copper Rule Improvements, or LCRI, requires all public water systems to remove lead service lines within 10 years, among other changes to regulations in the EPA s LCR. The service lines connect a home s plumbing system to a public water system s main water line. The LCRI specifies that the water provider will cover the cost for replacements of the customer s service line up to the first fitting inside the structure being served. Capital investment and operating costs incurred by water utilities for customer-side pipe replacements are typically recoverable in water rates charged to customers as approved by the applicable public service commission.

Results of Operations Analysis of the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to the Three Months Ended September 30, 2023. 

Operating Revenues 

Revenues totaled 29.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, 2.6 million, or 9.7 , more than revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2023 . 

Water sales revenue increased 2.5 million, or 11.3 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from the corresponding period in 2023, primarily as a result of a temporary rate increase of 14.6 of gross water sales placed into effect on November 28, 2023, as permitted under Delaware law. These temporary rates were replaced with the final approved rates pursuant to a DEPSC order that authorized a total increase of approximately 15.2 , with a rate effective date of June 12, 2024. The increase in both temporary rates and final approved customer base rates was partially offset by the Company s DSIC rate of 7.50 resetting to zero upon implementation of the temporary rate increase. In addition, there was an increase in overall water consumption due to drier weather experienced during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 and an increase in the number of customers served . We realized 82.7 and 81.5 of our total operating revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively, from the sale of water.

Other utility operating revenue increased approximately 0.1 million, or 3.8 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. This increase is primarily due to an increase in wastewater revenue associated with an increase in the number of customers served.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Overview 

Our primary sourc es of liquidity for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 30.1 million of cash provided by operating activities and 14.2 million in net contributions and advances from developers. We depend on the availability of capital for expansion, construction and maintenance. We rely on our sources of liquidity for investments in our utility plant and to meet our various payment obligations.

Operating Activities 

One of our primary sources of liquidity for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 30.1 million provided by cash flow from operating activities, compared to 23.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in cash flows from operating activities is primarily due to changes in net income, income tax receivable, and materials and supplies. Cash flows from operating activities is primarily provided by our utility operations and is impacted by the timeliness and adequacy of rate increases and changes in water consumption as a result of year-to-year variations in weather conditions, particularly during the summer. A significant part of our ability to maintain and meet our financial objectives is to ensure that our investments in utility plant and equipment are recovered in the rates charged to customers. As such, from time to time, we file rate increase requests to recover increases in operating expenses and investments in utility plant and equipment. See Note 13 Regulatory Proceedings. We will continue to borrow on available lines of credit in order to satisfy current liquidity needs. In addition, the Company has a long history of paying regular quarterly dividends as approved by our Board of Directors using net cash from operating activities. 

Investment Activities 

The primary focus of our investments is to continue to provide high quality reliable service to our growing service territory. Capital expenditures during the first nine months of 2024 were 30.9 million compared to 48.8 million during the same period in 2023. During the first nine months of 2024, these investments include relocation of facilities as a result of government mandates, renewals associated with the rehabilitation of aging infrastructure, installation of new main, purchase of new transportation equipment, upgrading and automating our meter reading equipment, construction of a new wastewater treatment plant and upgrading existing pumping stations to better serve our customers . Developers contributed 10.1 million of these total investments during the first nine months of 2024. 

Financing Activities 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, cash flows provided by financing activities were 8.4 million, compared to 30.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Our primary source of liquidity from financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 14.2 million in net contributions and advances from developers and 0.8 million from the issuance of long-term debt. Cash flows provided by financing activities decreased due to the net proceeds from the issuance of Class A Stock in May 2023 and June 2023 as well as decreased contributions in aid of construction and borrowings on lines of credit. We have several sources of liquidity to finance our investment in utility plant and other fixed assets. We estimate that future investments will be financed by our operations and external sources. We expect to fund our activities for the next twelve months using our projected cash generated from operations, bank credit lines, and capital market financing as needed to provide sufficient working capital to maintain normal operations, to meet our financing requirements and to expand through strategic acquisitions. We believe that our cash on hand and future cash generated from the foregoing activities will provide adequate resources to fund our short-term and long-term capital, operating and financing needs. However, there is no assurance that we will be able to secure funding on terms acceptable to us, or at all. Our cash flows from operations are primarily derived from water sales revenues and may be materially affected by changes in water sales due to weather and the timing and extent of increases in rates approved by state public service commissions.

At September 30, 2024, Artesian Resources had a 40 million line of credit with Citizens Bank, or Citizens, which is available to all subsidiaries of Artesian Resources. As of September 30, 2024, there was 40.0 million of available funds under this line of credit. The interest rate is a one-month Daily Secured Overnight Financing Rate, or SOFR, plus 10 basis points, or Term SOFR, plus an applicable margin of 0.85 , which was increased to 1.10 effective August 3, 2023. Term SOFR cannot be less than 0.00 . This is a demand line of credit and therefore the financial institution may demand payment for any outstanding amounts at any time. The term of this line of credit expires on the earlier of May 19, 2025 or any date on which Citizens demands payment. The Company expects to renew this line of credit.

At September 30, 2024, Artesian Water had a 20 million line of credit with CoBank, ACB, or CoBank, that allows for the financing of operations for Artesian Water, with up to 10 million of this line available for the operations of Artesian Water Maryland. As of September 30, 2024, there was 20.0 million of available funds under this line of credit. The interest rate for borrowings under this line are either a daily SOFR rate plus 1.45 option or a term SOFR rate plus 1.45 option that is locked in for either one or three months. The term of this line of credit expires on October 31, 2025. Artesian Water expects to renew this line of credit.

Artesian s long-term debt agreements and revolving lines of credit contain customary affirmative and negative covenants that are binding on us (which are in some cases subject to certain exceptions), including, but not limited to, restrictions on our ability to make certain loans and investments, guarantee certain obligations, enter into, or undertake, certain mergers, consolidations or acquisitions, transfer certain assets or change our business. As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with these covenants.

Long-term debt obligations reflect the maturities of certain series of our first mortgage bonds, which we intend to refinance when due if not refinanced earlier. One first mortgage bond is subject to redemption in a principal amount equal to 150,000 plus interest per calendar quarter. The state revolving fund loan obligation and promissory note obligation have an amortizing mortgage payment payable over a 20-year period. The first mortgage bonds, the state revolving fund loan and the promissory note have certain financial covenant provisions, the violation of which could result in default and require the obligation to be immediately repaid, including all interest. We have not experienced conditions that would result in our default under these agreements.

The asset purchase contractual obligation is related to the purchase of substantially all of the water operating assets from the Town of Clayton in May 2022, by Artesian Water. The total purchase price was 5.0 million. At closing, Artesian Water paid approximately 3.4 million. The balance is payable in five equal annual installments on the anniversary date of the closing date. Each annual installment is payable with interest at an annual rate of 2.0 .

In order to control purchased power cost, in February 2021, Artesian Water entered into an electric supply contract with MidAmerican that is effective from May 2021 to May 2025. The fixed rate was lowered 5.6 starting in May 2021. In February 2022, Artesian Water Maryland entered into an electric supply agreement with Constellation NewEnergy, Inc., effective from May 2022 through November 2025. In January 2022, following the acquisition of Tidewater Environmental Services, Inc. dba Artesian Wastewater, or TESI, assumed an electricity supply contract with WGL Energy that is effective through December 2024. These fixed rate electric supply contracts are for normal purchases and are not derivative instruments.

Payments for unconditional purchase obligations reflect minimum water purchase obligations based on rates that are subject to change under an interconnection agreement with the Chester Water Authority. The agreement is effective from January 1, 2022 through December 31, 2026, includes automatic five-year renewal terms, unless terminated by either party, and has a take or pay clause which required us to purchase water on a step-down schedule through July 5, 2022 and now requires us to purchase a minimum of 0.5 million gallons per day. In addition, payments for unconditional purchase obligations reflect minimum water purchase obligations based on a contract rate under our interconnection agreement with the Town of North East, which expires June 26, 2029. The agreement includes a remaining automatic five-year renewal term, unless terminated by either party.

In April 2021, Artesian Water entered into a 3-year agreement with Worldwide Industries Corporation effective July 1, 2021 to paint elevated water storage tanks. Pursuant to the agreement, the total expenditure for the three years was 1.2 million. In September 2022, this agreement was amended to paint an additional elevated water storage tank and to extend the term of the agreement for an additional year. Pursuant to the amended agreement, the total expenditure for the four years is 2.2 million.

Critical Accounting Estimates; Recent Accounting Pronouncements

This discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on the accounting policies used and disclosed in our 2023 consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes that were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and included as part of our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. The preparation of those financial statements required management to make assumptions and estimates that affected the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual amounts or results could differ from those based on such assumptions and estimates.

Our critical accounting estimates are described in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. There have been no changes in our critical accounting estimates. Our significant accounting policies are described in our notes to the 2023 consolidated financial statements included in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

Information concerning our implementation and the impact of recent accounting pronouncements issued by the FASB is included in the notes to our 2023 consolidated financial statements included in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 and also in the notes to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q . We did not adopt any accounting policy in the first nine months of 2024 that had a material impact on our financial condition, liquidity or results of operations.

ITEM 3 - QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

The Company is subject to the risk of fluctuating interest rates in the normal course of business. Our policy is to manage interest rates through the use of fixed rate long-term debt and, to a lesser extent, short-term debt. The Company's exposure to interest rate risk related to existing fixed rate, long-term debt is due to the term of the majority of our First Mortgage Bonds and the term of the promissory note, which have final maturity dates ranging from 2028 to 2049, and interest rates ranging from 4.24 to 5.96 , which exposes the Company to interest rate risk as interest rates may drop below the existing fixed rate of the long-term debt prior to such debt s maturity. In addition, the Company has interest rate exposure on 60 million of variable rate lines of credit with two banks. As of September 30, 2024 there were no outstanding balances on the lines of credit. Increases in variable interest rates result in an increase in the cost of borrowing on these variable rate lines of credit. We are also exposed to market risk associated with changes in commodity prices. Our risks associated with price increases in chemicals, electricity and other commodities are mitigated by our ability to recover our costs through rate increases to our customers. We have also sought to mitigate future significant electric price increases by signing multi-year supply contracts at fixed prices.

ITEM 4 CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

(a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon this evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report were effective in providing reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by us in reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is (1) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and (2) accumulated and communicated to our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In addition, the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report were effective to achieve the foregoing objectives. A control system cannot provide absolute assurance, however, that the objectives of the control system are met and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within a company have been detected.

(b) Change in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

No change in our internal control over financial reporting occurred during our most recent fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

ITEM 1 LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

Periodically, we are involved in other proceedings or litigation arising in the ordinary course of business. We do not believe that the ultimate resolution of these matters will materially affect our business, financial position or results of operations.

For a full discussion of our current legal proceedings or litigation arising in the ordinary course of business, refer to Note 16 - Legal Proceedings.

 subsection (i) do not cause a Proposal Notice that was not true, correct and complete in all respects and in compliance with this paragraph (2) when first delivered to the Corporation prior to the Notice Deadline to thereafter be in proper form in
 accordance with this paragraph (2). 

 (ii) Upon written request by the Secretary of the Corporation, the Board of Directors or any duly authorized committee thereof, any Proponent who has submitted a Proposal Notice to

 paragraph (2). If a Proponent fails to provide such written verification within such period and in the form requested, the information as to which written verification was requested shall be deemed not to have been provided in accordance with this
 paragraph (2). 

 (iii) Notwithstanding anything in these By-Laws to the contrary, no business (other than the election of Directors, the nomination of whom shall be governed by Article I, Section 1,
 paragraph (3) of these By-Laws) shall be conducted at any annual stockholders meeting except in accordance with the requirements set forth in this paragraph (2). The chairman of the meeting shall, if the facts warrant, determine, in consultation

 he or she shall so declare to the meeting and any such proposed business not properly brought before the meeting shall not be transacted. 

 (iv) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this paragraph (2), the disclosures required by this paragraph (2) shall not include any disclosures with respect to the ordinary
 course of business activities of any broker, dealer, commercial bank, or trust company who is deemed a Proponent or Stockholder Associated Person solely as a result of being the stockholder directed to prepare and submit a Proposal Notice required
 by these By-Laws on behalf of a beneficial owner of the shares held of record by such broker, dealer, commercial bank, or trust company and who is not otherwise affiliated or associated with such beneficial owner. 

 (v) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this paragraph (2), a Proponent shall also comply with any and all applicable requirements of the Exchange Act, the SEC, the DGCL and
 other applicable law with respect to the matters set forth in this paragraph (2), any solicitation of proxies contemplated by the Proponent in connection with its submission of a Proposal Notice to the Corporation, and any filings made with the SEC
 in connection therewith. 

 (vi) Nothing in these By-Laws shall be deemed to affect any rights of stockholders to request inclusion of proposals in the Corporation s proxy statement pursuant to, and subject to
 the limitations and requirements of, Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act and the SEC s and the SEC Staff s interpretations, guidance and no-action letter determinations relating thereto. 

 (vii) For a Proposal Notice to comply with the requirements of this paragraph (2), each of the requirements of this paragraph (2) shall be directly and expressly responded to and the
 Proposal Notice must clearly indicate and expressly reference which provisions of this paragraph (2) the information disclosed is intended to be responsive to. Any global cross-references shall be disregarded and information disclosed in the
 Proposal Notice in response to any provision of this paragraph (2) shall not be deemed responsive to any other provision hereof unless it is expressly cross-referenced to such other provision and it is clearly apparent how such information is
 responsive to such other provision. 

 (viii) For a Proposal Notice to comply with the requirements of this paragraph (2), it must set forth in writing directly within the body of the Proposal Notice, rather than being
 incorporated by reference from any pre-existing document or writing, including, but not limited to, any documents publicly filed with the SEC, all the information required to be included therein as set forth in this paragraph (2), and each of the
 requirements of this paragraph (2) shall be directly responded to in a manner that makes it clearly apparent how the information provided is specifically responsive to any requirements of this paragraph (2). 

 (ix) A Proponent submitting a Proposal Notice, by its delivery to the Corporation, represents and warrants that all information contained therein, as of the Notice Deadline, is true,
 accurate and complete in all respects and contains no false or misleading statements, and such Proponent acknowledges that it intends for the Corporation and the Board of Directors to rely on such information as (i) being true, accurate and
 complete in all respects and (ii) not containing any false or misleading statements. If the information submitted pursuant to this paragraph (2) by such Proponent shall not be true, correct and complete in all respects prior to the Notice
 Deadline, such information shall be deemed not to have been provided in accordance with this paragraph (2). 

 (x) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this paragraph (2), unless otherwise required by applicable law, if the Proponent is not Present in Person at the annual meeting of
 stockholders to present the proposed business, such proposed business shall be disregarded, notwithstanding that proxies in respect of such vote may have been received by the Corporation. In addition, business proposed to be brought before an
 annual meeting by a Proponent may not be brought before an annual meeting if such Proponent takes action contrary to the representations made in the Proposal Notice applicable to such business or if (i) when submitted to the Corporation prior to
 the Notice Deadline, the Proposal Notice applicable to such business contained an untrue statement of a fact or omitted to state a fact necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, or (ii) after being submitted to the Corporation, the
 Proposal Notice applicable to such business was not updated or supplemented by the Proponent in accordance with these By-Laws to cause the information provided in the Proposal Notice to be true, correct and complete in all respects. 

 (xi) A Proponent submitting a Proposal Notice pursuant to this paragraph (2), by its delivery to the Corporation, acknowledges that it understands that nothing contained therein
 shall be considered confidential or proprietary information and that neither the Corporation, the Board of Directors, nor any agents or representatives thereof shall be restricted, in any manner, from publicly disclosing or using any of the
 information contained in a Proposal Notice. 

 (xii) Nothing in this paragraph (2) shall be deemed to give any stockholder the right to have any proposal included in any proxy statement prepared by the Corporation, and, to the

 of any meeting of stockholders, nor more than sixty (60) days prior to the time for such other action as hereinbefore described; provided, however, that if no record date is fixed by the Board of Directors, the record date for determining
 stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall be at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which notice is given or, if notice is waived, at the close of business on the day next preceding the
 day on which the meeting is held, and, for determining stockholders entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of rights or to exercise any rights of change, conversion or exchange of stock or for any other
 purpose, the record date shall be at the close of business on the day on which the Board of Directors adopts a resolution relating thereto.

 A determination of stockholders of record entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall apply to any adjournment
 of the meeting; provided, however, that the Board of Directors may fix a new record date for the adjourned meeting.

 In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, the
 Board of Directors may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of Directors, and which date shall not be more than 10 days after the date upon which the
 resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of Directors. Any stockholder of record seeking to have the stockholders authorize or take corporate action by written consent shall, by written notice to the Secretary, request the Board of
 Directors to fix a record date. The Board of Directors shall promptly, but in all events within 10 days after the date on which such a request is received, adopt a resolution fixing the record date (unless a record date has previously been fixed by
 the Board of Directors pursuant to the first sentence of this paragraph). If no record date has been fixed by the Board of Directors within 10 days of the date on which such a request is received, the record date for determining stockholders
 entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, when no prior action by the Board of Directors is required by applicable law, shall be the first date on which a signed written consent setting forth the action taken or proposed
 to be taken is delivered to the Corporation by delivery to its registered office in the State of Delaware, its principal place of business, or any officer or agent of the Corporation having custody of the book in which proceedings of meetings of
 stockholders are recorded. Delivery made to the Corporation s registered office shall be by hand or by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested. If no record date has been fixed by the Board of Directors and prior action by the Board
 of Directors is required by applicable law, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to consent to corporation action in writing without a meeting shall be at the close of business on the date on which the Board of Directors adopts the
 resolution taking such prior action.

 ARTICLE VIII - INDEMNIFICATION OF DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS 

 Section 1. Right to Indemnification. 

 Each person who was or is made a party or is threatened to be made a party to or is otherwise involved in any action, suit or
 proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (hereinafter a proceeding ), by reason of the fact that he or she is or was a director, officer or controller of the Corporation or is or was serving at the request of the
 Corporation as a director, officer, or trustee of another corporation or of a partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, including service with respect to an employee benefit plan (hereinafter an indemnitee ), whether the basis of such
 proceeding is alleged action in an official capacity as a director, officer, controller or trustee or in any other capacity while serving as a director, officer, controller or trustee, shall be indemnified and held harmless by the Corporation to the
 fullest extent authorized by the Delaware General Corporation Law, as the same exists or may hereafter be amended (but, in the case of any such amendment, only to the extent that such amendment permits the Corporation to provide broader
 indemnification rights than such law permitted the Corporation to provide prior to such amendment), against all expense, liability and loss (including attorneys fees, judgments, fines, ERISA excise taxes or penalties and amounts paid in settlement)
 reasonably incurred or suffered by such indemnitee in connection therewith; provided, however, that, except as provided in Section 3 of this ARTICLE VIII with respect to proceedings to enforce rights to indemnification, the Corporation shall
 indemnify any such indemnitee in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such indemnitee only if such proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized by the Board of Directors of the Corporation.

 Section 2. Right to Advancement of Expenses. 

 In addition to the right to indemnification conferred in Section 1 of this Article VIII, an indemnitee shall also have the right to be
 paid by the Corporation the expenses (including attorney s fees) incurred in defending any such proceeding in advance of its final disposition (hereinafter an advancement of expenses provided, however, that, if the Delaware General Corporation
 Law requires, an advancement of expenses incurred by an indemnitee in his or her capacity as a director, officer or controller (and not in any other capacity in which service was or is rendered by such indemnitee, including, without limitation,
 service to an employee benefit plan) shall be made only upon delivery to the Corporation of an undertaking (hereinafter an undertaking ), by or on behalf of such indemnitee, to repay all amounts so advanced if it shall ultimately be determined by
 final judicial decision from which there is no further right to appeal (hereinafter a final adjudication that such indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified for such expenses under this Section 2 or otherwise.

 Section 3. Right of Indemnitee to Bring Suit. 

 If a claim under Section 1 or 2 of this ARTICLE VIII is not paid in full by the Corporation within sixty (60) days after a written claim
 has been received by the Corporation, except in the case of a claim for an advancement of expenses, in which case the applicable period shall be twenty (20) days, the indemnitee may at any time thereafter bring suit against the Corporation to recover
 the unpaid amount of the claim. If successful in whole or in part in any such suit, or in a suit brought by the Corporation to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the indemnitee shall be entitled to be paid
 also the expense of prosecuting or defending such suit. In (i) any suit brought by the indemnitee to enforce a right to indemnification hereunder (but not in a suit brought by the indemnitee to enforce a right to an advancement of expenses) it shall
 be a defense that, and (ii) in any suit brought by the Corporation to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the Corporation shall be entitled to recover such expenses upon a final adjudication that, the
 indemnitee has not met any applicable standard for indemnification set forth in the Delaware General Corporation Law. Neither the failure of the Corporation (including its directors who are not parties to such action, a committee of such directors,
 independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such suit that indemnification of the indemnitee is proper in the circumstances because the indemnitee has met the applicable standard of
 conduct set forth in the Delaware General Corporation Law, nor an actual determination by the Corporation (including its directors who are not parties to such action, a committee of such directors, independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) that
 the indemnitee has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall create a presumption that the indemnitee has not met the applicable standard of conduct or, in the case of such a suit brought by the indemnitee, be a defense to such suit. In any
 suit brought by the indemnitee to enforce a right to indemnification or to an advancement of expenses hereunder, or brought by the Corporation to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the burden of proving that
 the indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified, or to such advancement of expenses, under this ARTICLE VIII or otherwise shall be on the Corporation.

 Section 4. Non-Exclusivity of Rights. 

 The rights to indemnification and to the advancement of expenses conferred in this ARTICLE VIII shall not be exclusive of any other
 right which any person may have or hereafter acquire under any statute, the Corporation s Certificate of Incorporation, By-laws, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise.

 Section 5. Insurance. 

 The Corporation may maintain insurance, at its expense, to protect itself and any director, officer, employee or agent of the
 Corporation or another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any expense, liability or loss, whether or not the Corporation would have the power to indemnify such person against such expense, liability or loss
 under the Delaware General Corporation Law.

 Section 6. Indemnification of Employees and Agents of the Corporation. 

 The Corporation may, to the extent authorized from time to time by the Board of Directors, grant rights to indemnification and to the
 advancement of expenses to any employee or agent of the Corporation to the fullest extent of the provisions of this Article with respect to the indemnification and advancement of expenses of directors and officers of the Corporation.

 Section 7. Nature of Rights. 

 The rights conferred upon indemnitees in this ARTICLE VIII shall be contract rights and such rights shall continue as to an indemnitee
 who has ceased to be a director, officer, controller or trustee and shall inure to the benefit of the indemnitee s heirs, executors and administrators. Any amendment, alteration or repeal of this Article VIII that adversely affects any right of an
 indemnitee or its successors shall be prospective only and shall not limit or eliminate any such right with respect to any proceeding involving any occurrence or alleged occurrence of any action or omission to act that took place prior to such
 amendment or repeal.

 ARTICLE IX - AMENDMENTS 

 In furtherance and not in limitation of the powers conferred by law, the Board of Directors is expressly authorized to make, alter,
 amend and repeal these By-Laws subject to the power of the holders of capital stock of the Corporation to alter, amend or repeal the By-Laws; provided, however, that, with respect to the powers of holders of capital stock to make, alter, amend and
