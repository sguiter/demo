shares of Common Stock at a nominal exercise price as described below) over a 12-month period commencing on the date of the Amended BTC
Contract. The purchase price for the Total BTC will be paid by the Company in cash or shares of Common Stock. Although the Amended BTC
Contract states that the Association Seller (Party B) owns the virtual currency , to our knowledge, this statement was mistakenly
made. As of the date of the Amended BTC Contract, it were the Schedule I BTC Sellers who are the individual members of the Association
Seller, not the Association Seller itself, who own the BTC to be sold under the Amended BTC Contract. 

To our knowledge, the Association Seller entered
into a cooperation agreement with each Schedule I BTC Sellers (the Cooperation Agreement on the same day when the Amended

set forth in the Cooperation Agreement) to a BTC wallet address designated by the Association Seller for the transactions contemplated

Pursuant to the Amended BTC Contract, the
Company shall exercise its option to purchase BTC thereunder prior to September 24, 2025. While the Company s purchase option thereunder
is time-limited, the Amended BTC Contract itself will remain in effect without a defined expiration date, unless otherwise terminated.
In the event of a breach by either party, the non-breaching party has the right to terminate the agreement. In such case, the breaching
party will be obligated to pay a penalty of to the non-breaching party.

Impact on Company s Capitalization and
Stockholder Approval 

The issuance of securities pursuant to the Amended
BTC Contract will not affect the rights of the Company s existing stockholders, but such issuances will have a significant dilutive
effect on the Company s existing stockholders, including the voting power of the existing stockholders.

after the issuance of the Shares (assuming no exercise of the Warrants), there will be issued and outstanding shares of the
Common Stock, and the ownership percentage of the Company s existing stockholders in the Company will be diluted to approximately
 . Assuming full exercise of the Warrants concurrently with the issuance of the Shares, immediately after the issuance of the Shares,
there will be issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock, and the ownership percentage of the Company s existing
stockholders in the Company will be further diluted to approximately . 

Pursuant to Nasdaq Rule
5635(a), if an issuer intends to issue common stock or securities convertible into or exercisable for common stock, in connection with
the acquisition of stock or assets of another company, which may equal or exceed of the outstanding common stock or voting power
on a pre-transaction basis, the issuer generally must obtain the prior approval of its stockholders. Pursuant to Nasdaq Rule 5635(d),
if an issuer intends to issue common stock or securities convertible into or exercisable for common stock, other than in a public offering,
which may equal or exceed of the outstanding common stock or voting power on a pre-transaction basis for a price that is lower than
(i) the Nasdaq Official Closing Price (as reflected on Nasdaq.com) immediately preceding the signing of a binding agreement; or (ii)
the average Nasdaq Official Closing Price of the common stock (as reflected on Nasdaq.com) for the trading immediately preceding
the signing of the binding agreement for such common stock, the issuer generally must obtain the prior approval of its stockholders. 

The Shares to be
issued to the Schedule I BTC Sellers in the Amended BTC Transaction exceeds the threshold for which stockholder approval is required
under Nasdaq Rule 5635(a), and the Warrant Shares to be issued to the Schedule I BTC Sellers upon the full exercise of the Warrants could

for the Amended BTC Transaction in accordance with the Company s articles of incorporation and bylaws on September 24, 2024.

Business 

Next
Technology Holdings Inc (formerly known as WeTrade Group, Inc was incorporated in the State of Wyoming on March 28, 2019.
We currently pursue two corporate strategies. One business strategy is to continue providing software development services, and the other
strategy is to acquire and hold bitcoin. 

Software
development 

We
provide AI-enabled software development services to our customers, which include developing, designing, and implementing various SAAS
software solutions for businesses of all types, including industrial and other businesses. 

Bitcoin
Acquisition Strategy 

Our
bitcoin acquisition strategy generally involves acquiring bitcoin with our liquid assets that exceed working capital requirements, and
from time to time, subject to market conditions, issuing debt or equity securities or engaging in other capital raising transactions
with the objective of using the proceeds to purchase bitcoin. 

We
view our bitcoin holdings as long-term holdings and expect to continue to accumulate bitcoin. We have not set any specific target for
the amount of bitcoin we seek to hold, and we will continue to monitor market conditions in determining whether to engage in additional
financings to purchase additional bitcoin. 

This
overall strategy also contemplates that we may (i) periodically sell bitcoin for general corporate purposes, including to generate cash
for treasury management or in connection with strategies that generate tax benefits in accordance with applicable law, (ii) enter into
additional capital raising transactions that are collateralized by our bitcoin holdings, and (iii) consider pursuing additional strategies
to create income streams or otherwise generate funds using our bitcoin holdings. 

We
believe that, due to its limited supply, bitcoin offers the opportunity for appreciation in value if its adoption increases and has the
potential to serve as a hedge against inflation in the long-term.

Financing
activities 

Cash provided
by our financing activities was 634 for the period ended June 30, 2024 as compared to cash provided by financing activities of 318,000.
The decrease is mainly due to lesser in shareholders advance during the period as compare to the prior period. 

Inflation 

Inflation
does not materially affect our business or the results of our operations. 

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements 

We
do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements. 

Critical
Accounting Policies 

We
prepare our financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles of the United States GAAP ).
GAAP represents a comprehensive set of accounting and disclosure rules and requirements. The preparation of our financial statements
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
period. Our actual results could differ from those estimates. We use historical data to assist in the forecast of our future results.
Deviations from our projections are addressed when our financials are reviewed on a monthly basis. This allows us to be proactive in
our approach to managing our business. It also allows us to rely on proven data rather than having to make assumptions regarding our
estimates. 

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements 

We
have reviewed all the recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting pronouncements and we do not believe any of these pronouncements
will have a material impact on the Company financial statements.

ITEM
3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 

We
are a smaller reporting company as defined by Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K, and as such are not required to provide
the information contained in this item pursuant to Item 305 of Regulation S-K. 

ITEM
4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Disclosure
Controls and Procedures. 

The
management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. The Company s
internal control over financial reporting is a process designed under the supervision of the Company s Chief Executive Officer
and Chief Financial Officer to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the
Company s financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 

With
respect to the period ended June 30, 2024, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, we conducted an evaluation
of the effectiveness of the design and operations of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)
promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. 

Based
upon our evaluation regarding the period ended June 30, 2024, the Company s management, including its Principal Executive Officer,
has concluded that its disclosure controls and procedures were not effective due to the Company s limited internal resources and
lack of ability to have multiple levels of transaction review. Material weaknesses noted are lack of an audit committee, lack of a majority
of outside directors on the board of directors, resulting in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal
controls and procedures; and management is dominated by two individuals, without adequate compensating controls. However, management
believes the financial statements and other information presented herewith are materially correct. 

Our
management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2024. In making this assessment,
our management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO in Internal Control - Integrated Framework - Guidance for Smaller Public Companies (the COSO criteria). Based on our assessment, management
identified material weaknesses related to: (i) our internal audit functions; (ii) a lack of segregation of duties within accounting functions;
and the lack of multiple levels of review of our accounting data. Based on this evaluation, our management concluded that as of June
30, 2024, we did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting. 

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation
of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with any policies and procedures may deteriorate. Due to our size and nature, segregation of all conflicting
duties may not always be possible and may not be economically feasible. To the extent possible, we will implement procedures to assure
that the initiation of transactions, the custody of assets and the recording of transactions will be performed by separate individuals.
With proper funding we plan on remediating the significant deficiencies identified above, and we will continue to monitor the effectiveness
of these steps and make any changes that our management deems appropriate. 

A
material weakness is a control deficiency (within the meaning of Public Company Accounting Oversight Board Auditing Standard No. 5) or
combination of control deficiencies, that results in a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial
statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during our most recently completed fiscal quarter that
has materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART
II OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM
1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 

Since
mid-September 2023, Mr. Zheng Dai, Mr. Pijun Liu, and certain individuals under their control (the Unauthorized Persons had been falsely and repeatedly holding themselves out as representing and/or authorized to represent the Company. For example, the Unauthorized
Persons caused to be filed certain current reports on Forms 8-K dated September 28, 2023 and October 10, 2023, in which they purported
to appoint new officers and directors. These filings were false and should be disregarded. 

On
September 28, 2023, a derivative lawsuit was filed by certain purported shareholders affiliated with the Unauthorized Persons in the
United States District Court for the District of Wyoming against certain officers and directors of the Company, seeking control of the
Company. This case was dismissed without prejudice on October 18, 2023. 

On
October 18, 2023, the same individuals who filed the above-described derivative suit filed a direct action against the Company in the
Chancery Court of the State of Wyoming (the Chancery Court ), again seeking control of the Company. The Company responded
to the lawsuit, sought a temporary restraining order restraining the plaintiff-shareholders and their affiliates (including the Unauthorized
Persons) from claiming be in control of the Company. 

On
November 7, 2023, the Chancery Court issued a temporary restraining order substantially restraining the plaintiff-shareholders and their
affiliates from claiming to act on behalf of the Company. The lawsuit remains pending as at reporting date. 

On
November 30, 2023, the Company responded to plaintiffs arguments that they controlled the Company, pointing out that plaintiffs 
case (Mr. Dai Zheng and his affiliates) was largely built upon forged signatures and other fabricated materials. In response, the plaintiffs
withdrew their opposition to the Company s request for an injunction. 

On
January 5, 2024, the Chancery Court entered a preliminary injunction order (attached hereto). Specifically, the order restrained Mr.
Dai Zheng and his affiliates from the following conduct: 

(i)
acting as or holding themselves out as majority shareholders, directors, executives, or employees of the Company and its affiliates; 

(ii)
making any attempts to contact the SEC, Nasdaq, government authorities, or make any filing or press release on behalf of the Company; 

(iii)
making any attempts to change the board composition and executive team; 

(iv)
disseminating false statements regarding the Company and its leadership; 

(v)
making any attempts to contact the Company s service providers, including auditors, stock transfer agents, and filing agents; 

(vi)
making any attempts to issue the Company s shares.

5. OTHER INFORMATION 

Capitalization 

On
June 9, 2023, the Wyoming Secretary of State approved the Company s certificate of amendment to amend its Articles of Incorporation
to effect 1 for 185 Reverse Stock Split. The total issued and outstanding shares of the Company s common stock decreased from 195,057,503
to 1,054,364 shares, with the par value unchanged at zero. 

The
Reverse Stock Split is intended to more expediently enable the Company to regain compliance to achieve a minimum bid price of 1.00 per
share for continued listing on Nasdaq, as set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) (the Minimum Bid Requirement ). As
a result of the Reverse Stock Split, every one-for-one hundred and eighty-five (185) shares of the Company s Common Stock then
issued and outstanding will automatically, and without any action of the Company or any holder thereof, be combined, converted, and changed
into one (1) validly issued and non-assessable share of Common Stock. fractional shares will be issued to any shareholder, and in
lieu of issuing any such fractional shares, the fractional shares resulting from the Reverse Stock Split will be rounded up to the nearest
whole share of Common Stock. 

In
September 2023, there were 1,570,600 shares issued with the total amount of 12,616,454, and the Company s common stock issued
has been increased to 2,625,130 shares as of March 31, 2024. In April 2024, there are 4,351,280 shares issued with the total amount of
 14,776,000 for the acquisition of 20 of associate company and loan conversion to equity, the Company s common stock issued has
been increased to 6,976,410 shares as of June 30, 2024. 

Bitcoin
Option Contract 

On
May 2, 2024, the Company entered into a Bitcoin Option Contract (the Option Contract with the Association Seller. Under
the Option Contract, the Association Seller agrees to sell, and the Company has the option to purchase, up to 20,000 BTC at a fixed price
of US 60,000 per BTC over a three-year period commencing on May 2, 2024. The Company can exercise this option at any time during the
three-year period, either in one or multiple transactions, as mutually agreed upon by both parties. Payments for the BTC can be made
in cash or in the Company s common stock, at the Company s discretion. In addition, the Option Contract allows for an optional
10 advance payment in cash if agreed upon by both parties. Although the Option Contract states that the Association Seller (Party B)
 owns the virtual currency , to our knowledge, this statement was mistakenly made. As of the date of the Option Contract,
it were the individual members of the Association Seller, not the Association Seller itself, who own the BTC to be sold under the Option
Contract. 

As
of the date of this report, the Company has not paid any advance payment, nor exercised its option to purchase any BTC under the BTC
Option Contract. Further, the Company does not intend to exercise its option to purchase any BTC under the BTC Option Contract. 

The
above description of the Option Contract does not purport to be complete, and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text
of the Option Contract, a copy of which is attached to the Company s Current Report on Form 8-K as Exhibit 10.2, filed with the
SEC on May 6, 2024, which is incorporated by reference herein.
