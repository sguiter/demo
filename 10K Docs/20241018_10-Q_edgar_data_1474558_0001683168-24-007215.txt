Factors that could cause
or contribute to such differences may include, but are not limited to, those described under the heading Risk Factors 
which may be included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended November 30, 2022 as filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak
only as of the date of this report. The Company undertakes no obligation to revise any forward-looking statements in order to reflect
events or circumstances that may subsequently arise. Readers are urged to carefully review and consider the various disclosures made by

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations. 

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 

The following discussion may contain forward-looking
statements regarding the Company, its business prospects and its results of operations that are subject to certain risks and uncertainties
posed by many factors and events that could cause the Company s actual business, prospects and results of operations to differ materially
from those that may be anticipated by such forward-looking statements. The risks and uncertainties may be summarized in other documents
that the Company may file with the Securities Exchange Commission, such as our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended November
30, 2023. These forward-looking statements reflect our view only as of the date of this report. The Company cannot guarantee future results,
levels of activity, performance, or achievement. The Company does not undertake any obligation to update or correct any forward-looking
statements. 

ANALYSIS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION 

The Company has limited operations and is actively
seeking a merger, reverse merger, acquisition or business combination opportunities with an operating business or other financial transaction
opportunities. Until a transaction is effectuated, the Company does not expect to have significant operations. Accordingly, during this
period the Company does not expect to achieve sufficient income to offset the Company s operating expenses, resulting in operating
losses that may require the Company to use and thereby reduce the Company s limited cash balance. The Company s prepaid expenses
during the nine-months ended August 31, 2024 remained unchanged. Until the Company completes a merger, reverse merger or other financial
transaction, and unless interest rates increase dramatically, the Company expects to continue to incur losses between 1,000 to 2,000
per quarter. The Company does not have any arrangements with banks or financial institutions with respect to the availability of financing
in the future. 

The payment of any cash distributions is subject
to the discretion of our board of directors. At this time, the Company has no plans to pay any additional cash distributions in the foreseeable
future. 

CURRENT BUSINESS 

Since November 30, 2015, the Company s operations
consist of a search for a merger, acquisition, reverse merger or a business transaction opportunity with an operating business or other
financial transaction however, there can be no assurance that this plan will be successfully implemented. Until a transaction is
effectuated, the Company does not expect to have significant operations. At this time, the Company has no arrangements or understandings
with respect to any potential merger, acquisition, reverse merger or business combination candidate pursuant to which the Company may
become an operating company. 

Opportunities may come to the Company s
attention from various sources, including our management, our stockholders, professional advisors, securities broker dealers, venture
capitalists and private equity funds, members of the financial community and others who may present unsolicited proposals. At this time,
the Company has no plans, understandings, agreements, or commitments with any individual or entity to act as a finder in regard to any
business opportunities. While it is not currently anticipated that the Company will engage unaffiliated professional firms specializing
in business acquisitions, reorganizations or other such transactions, such firms may be retained if such arrangements are deemed to be
in the best interest of the Company. Compensation to a finder or business acquisition firm may take various forms, including one-time
cash payments, payments involving issuance of securities (including those of the Company), or any combination of these or other compensation
arrangements. Consequently, the Company is currently unable to predict the cost of utilizing such services. 

The Company has decided to concentrate its efforts
in the mining sector without regard to geographic location. In evaluating a potential transaction, the Company analyzes all available
factors and make a determination based on a composite of available facts, without reliance on any single factor. 

10 

It is not possible at this time to predict the
nature of a transaction in which the Company may participate. Specific business opportunities would be reviewed as well as the respective
needs and desires of the Company and the legal structure or method deemed by management to be suitable would be selected. In implementing
a structure for a particular transaction, the Company may become a party to a merger, consolidation, reorganization, tender offer, joint
venture, license, purchase and sale of assets, or purchase and sale of stock, or other arrangement the exact nature of which cannot now
be predicted. Additionally, the Company may act directly or indirectly through an interest in a partnership, corporation or other form
of organization. Implementing such structure may require the merger, consolidation or reorganization of the Company with other business
organizations and there is no assurance that the Company would be the surviving entity. In addition, our present management and stockholders
may not have control of a majority of the voting shares of the Company following reorganization or other financial transaction. As part
of such a transaction, some or all of the Company s existing directors may resign and new directors may be appointed. The Company s
operations following the consummation of a transaction will be dependent on the nature of the transaction. There may also be various risks
inherent in the transaction, the nature and magnitude of which cannot be predicted. 

The Company may also be subject to increased governmental
regulation following a transaction however, it is not possible at this time to predict the nature or magnitude of such increased
regulation, if any. 

The Company expects to continue to incur moderate
losses each quarter until a transaction considered appropriate by management is effectuated. 

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION 

During the quarter ended August 31, 2024, the
Company had a loss from operations of 120,991. During the quarter ended August 31, 2023, the loss from operations was 560. No taxes
were paid in the quarters ended August 31, 2024, or 2023. 

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 

Stockholders equity as of August 31, 2024,
was (152,324), compared to 18,518 at November 30, 2023. The attributable net loss was incurred by normal general and administrative
operating procedures during the nine months ended August 31, 2024. 

Net cash used in operating activities was 40,370
during the nine months ended August 31, 2024, compared to net cash used in operating activities of (60,079) in the nine months ended
August 31, 2023. 

Cash on hand at August 31, 2024 was 40,370, compared
to NIL at November 30, 2023. 

The Company has no material off-balance sheet
arrangements. There has been no material change in any contractual obligation as reported in the Company s Annual Report on Form
10-K for the fiscal year ended November 30, 2023. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures
about Market Risk. 

Smaller reporting companies are not required to
provide the information required under this Item.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

As of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly
Report on Form 10-Q, the Company s management has evaluated, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules
13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934). Disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information
required to be disclosed in the Company s reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized
and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms and that such information
is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on this evaluation, the Company s Chief Executive Officer
and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of August 31, 2024. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial
Reporting 

There were no changes in the Company s internal
control over financial reporting during the quarter ended August 31, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to
materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Management does not believe that there are significant
deficiencies in the design or operation of the Company s internal controls that could adversely affect the Company s ability
to record, process, summarize and report financial data.
