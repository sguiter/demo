 PART 1: FINANCIAL INFORMATION 

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD A). 
 
 The following discussion and analysis of our results of operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with the unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes thereto presented in this quarterly report and the audited Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes thereto included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC) on February 20, 2024 (the 2023 Form 10-K). Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis constitutes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements. See Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements included elsewhere in this report. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed below and those identified in our other filings with the SEC, including in the Risk Factors and Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations sections of our 2023 Form 10-K and this and our other Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q. 

OVERVIEW 
 
 We are a tech-forward financial services company that provides simple, personalized payment, lending and saving solutions. We create opportunities for our customers and partners through digitally enabled choices that offer ease, empowerment, financial flexibility and exceptional customer experiences. Driven by a digital-first approach, data insights and white-label technology, we deliver growth for our partners through a comprehensive product suite, including private label and co-brand credit cards and buy now, pay later (BNPL) products such as installment loans and our split-pay offerings. We also offer direct-to-consumer solutions that give customers more access, choice and freedom through our branded Bread Cashback American Express Credit Card, Bread Rewards TM American Express Credit Card and Bread Savings products. 
 
 Our partner base consists of large consumer-based businesses, including well-known brands such as (alphabetically) AAA, Academy Sports + Outdoors, Caesars, Dell Technologies, the NFL, Signet, Ulta and Victoria s Secret, as well as small- and medium-sized businesses (SMBs). Our partner base is well diversified across a broad range of industries, including travel and entertainment, health and beauty, jewelry, sporting goods, home goods, technology and electronics and the industry in which we first began, specialty apparel. We believe our comprehensive suite of payment, lending and saving solutions, along with our related marketing and data and analytics, offers us a significant competitive advantage with products relevant across all customer segments (Gen Z, Millennial, Gen X and Baby Boomers). The breadth and quality of our product and service offerings have enabled us to establish and maintain long-standing partner relationships. We operate our business through a single reportable segment, with our primary source of revenue being from Interest and fees on loans from our various credit card and other loan products, and to a lesser extent from contractual relationships with our brand partners. 
 
 Throughout this report, unless stated or the context implies otherwise, the terms Bread Financial , BFH , the Company , we , our or us refer to Bread Financial Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis. References to Parent Company refer to Bread Financial Holdings, Inc. on a parent-only standalone basis. In addition, in this report we may refer to the retailers and other companies with whom we do business as our partners , brand partners , or clients , provided that the use of the term partner , partnering or any similar term does not mean or imply a formal legal partnership, and is not meant in any way to alter the terms of Bread Financial s relationship with any third parties. We offer our credit products through our insured depository institution subsidiaries, Comenity Bank and Comenity Capital Bank, which together are referred to herein as the Banks . 

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES 
 
 We prepare our audited Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). However, certain information included herein constitutes Non-GAAP Financial 
 1 

Table of Contents 

Measures. Our calculations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures may differ from the calculations of similarly titled measures by other companies. In particular: 
 
 In August and again in September 2024, we entered into separate, privately negotiated repurchase agreements with a limited number of convertible note holders to repurchase a portion of our outstanding 316 million aggregate principal amount of 4.25 Convertible Senior Notes due 2028 (the Convertible Notes). From a GAAP perspective, we paid a premium to induce these repurchases which resulted in an impact to non-interest expenses. This aggregate 96 million impact is reflected in Total non-interest expenses, with a corresponding 5 million favorable tax impact, also reflected in Net income and consequentially our Earnings per diluted share. We have shown adjustments to these three financial statement line items, for total Company as well as for continuing operations, to exclude the impact from our repurchased Convertible Notes. We use Adjusted total non-interest expenses, Adjusted net income, and Adjusted earnings per diluted share to more clearly evaluate the ongoing operations of the Company. 
 Pretax pre-provision earnings (PPNR) represents Income from continuing operations before income taxes and the Provision for credit losses. PPNR excluding gain on portfolio sale and impact from repurchased Convertible Notes then excludes from PPNR the gain on any portfolio sale in the period, as well as the inducement expense from our repurchased Convertible Notes in the period. We use PPNR and PPNR excluding gain on portfolio sale and impact from repurchased Convertible Notes as metrics to evaluate our results of operations before income taxes, excluding the volatility that can occur within Provision for credit losses and the one-time nature of a gain on the sale of a portfolio and/or the impact from repurchased Convertible Notes. 
 Return on average tangible common equity (ROTCE) represents annualized Income from continuing operations divided by average Tangible common equity. Tangible common equity (TCE) represents Total stockholders' equity reduced by Goodwill and intangible assets, net. We use ROTCE as a metric to evaluate the Company's performance. 
 Tangible common equity over Tangible assets (TCE/TA) represents TCE divided by Tangible assets (TA), which is Total assets reduced by Goodwill and intangible assets, net. We use TCE/TA as a metric to evaluate the Company s capital adequacy and estimate its ability to absorb losses. 
 Tangible book value per common share represents TCE divided by shares outstanding. We use Tangible book value per common share, a metric used across the industry, to estimate liquidation value. 
 
 We believe the use of these Non-GAAP financial measures provide additional clarity in understanding our results of operations and trends. For a reconciliation of these Non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, please see Table 6: Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures that follows. 

BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT 
 
 This Business Environment section provides an overview of our results of operations and financial position for the third quarter of 2024, as well as our related outlook for the remainder of 2024 and certain of the uncertainties associated with achieving that outlook. This section should be read in conjunction with the other information included or incorporated by reference in this Form 10-Q, including Consolidated Results of Operations , Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors herein, and in our 2023 Form 10-K as well as our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2024 and our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, which provide further discussion of variances in our results of operations over the periods of comparison, along with other factors that could impact future results and the Company achieving its outlook. Unless otherwise specified, the discussion included herein is for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared with the same period in the prior year. 
 
 Credit sales of 6.5 billion were down 3 year-over-year reflecting self-moderated consumer spending and strategic credit tightening, partially offset by new brand partner growth. Average credit card and other loans of 17.8 billion increased 1 , also driven primarily by new brand partner growth, as well as a stabilizing consumer spending trend. End-of-period credit card and other loans of 17.9 billion were flat year-over-year. Total interest income was down 2 from the third quarter of 2023, primarily as a result of lower Interest and fees on loans due to decreased late fees driven by lower early-stage delinquency volumes, our gradual shift in product mix to a lower proportion of private label accounts which tend to have higher late fees, and higher reversals of interest and fees resulting from higher gross credit losses; all partially offset by Interest on cash and investment securities. Net interest margin for the third quarter of 2024 was 18.8 , relative to 20.6 for the third quarter of 2023, driven by decreased late fees and higher funding costs, particularly with direct-to-consumer (DTC) deposits. Year-over-year, Non-interest income decreased 3 million, primarily driven by a decrease in the current 
 2 

Table of Contents 

year in merchant discount fees resulting from lower big ticket credit sales. Overall, Total net interest and non-interest income for the quarter was 983 million, down 5 versus the third quarter of 2023. 
 
 Provision for credit losses increased for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, relative to the third quarter of 2023, driven by a 22 million reserve build in the current year period compared with a flat reserve build in the prior year period. The increase in Provision for credit losses also includes net principal losses of 347 million and 304 million during those same respective periods. 
 
 Our Allowance for credit losses decreased as of September 30, 2024, relative to December 31, 2023, due primarily to lower Credit card and other loans balances, which are down from their seasonal peak at the beginning of 2024, partially offset by the increased reserve rate. Overall, we continue to maintain an elevated reserve rate, 12.2 as of September 30, 2024, reflecting a conservative weighting of economic scenarios in our credit reserve modeling, which we intend to maintain until we see sustained improvement in delinquencies and an improved macroeconomic outlook. From an overall credit quality perspective, our percentage of Vantage 660+ cardholders remains above pre-pandemic levels due to prudent credit tightening and a more diversified product mix, with co-brand and proprietary cards representing a larger proportion of our portfolio. 
 
 Total non-interest expenses of 574 million increased 14 from the third quarter of 2023. The year-over-year increase was primarily driven by the impact from our repurchased Convertible Notes, which increased Total non-interest expenses by 96 million. Excluding the impact from our repurchased Convertible Notes, Adjusted total non-interest expenses, a Non-GAAP financial measure, decreased 5 from the third quarter of 2023, driven by a decrease in Card and processing expenses, including fraud, partially offset by an increase in Employee compensation and benefits expense due to higher short-term and long-term incentive compensation. 
 
 We continued strengthening our balance sheet during the third quarter of 2024, by reducing debt and dilution risk, while growing our Common equity tier 1 capital ratio to 13.3 as of September 30, 2024, a 40 basis points improvement year-over-year. Additionally, DTC deposits increased to 7.5 billion as of September 30, 2024, with average DTC deposits now representing 41 of our total funding, up from 35 a year ago. 
 
 During the third quarter of 2024 we made further progress with the implementation of our mitigation strategy in response to the final rule on credit card late fees published by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). Industry organizations have challenged the final rule in court, and the ultimate outcome of such challenge, including the impact on the final rule, is uncertain. The final rule had an original effective date of May 14, 2024 however, on May 10, 2024, the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas granted an injunction and stay of the final rule, and the injunction granted remains in effect as of the date of this report. We are closely monitoring the ongoing litigation related to the rule, but also continue to execute on our mitigation strategy given the uncertainty surrounding the timing and outcome. Because of that uncertainty, our full year 2024 financial outlook assumes the final rule does not take effect this year. Refer to Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD A) Business Environment in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2024 for our 2024 financial outlook inclusive of impacts from the CFPB's final rule on credit card late fees. 
 
 Our 2024 financial outlook reflects slower Credit sales growth as a result of continued moderation in consumer spending and strategic credit tightening, both of which consequently will impact growth in Credit card and other loans and Net interest and non-interest income, as well as the Net loss rate. In addition, our 2024 outlook assumes ongoing interest rate decreases by the Federal Reserve Board, which will slightly decrease Total net interest income. 
 
 Based on our current economic outlook, strategic credit tightening actions, higher gross credit losses, and visibility into our new business pipeline, we expect 2024 Average credit card and other loans to be down low-single digits on a percentage point basis relative to 2023. Total net interest and non-interest income, excluding the gains on portfolio sales during the years of comparison, is anticipated to be down in the low- to mid-single digits on a percentage point basis from 2023, with full year Net interest margin expected to be lower than 2023 reflecting higher reversals of interest and fees due to expected higher gross credit losses, declining interest rates, and a continued shift in product mix to co-brand and proprietary products. 
 
 As a result of efficiencies gained from our ongoing investments in technology modernization and digital advancement, along with disciplined expense management, we expect Total non-interest expenses excluding the impact from our 
 3 

Table of Contents 

repurchased Convertible Notes, a Non-GAAP financial measure, to be down mid-single digits on a percentage point basis relative to 2023. Total non-interest expenses are projected to be higher sequentially in the fourth quarter of 2024 compared with the third quarter s Adjusted total non-interest expenses, a Non-GAAP financial measure, due to higher sales volumes and marketing expenses. 
 
 Our 2024 financial outlook continues to assume a full year Net loss rate in the low 8 range. As a result of the recent hurricanes we have frozen delinquency progression for cardholders in Federal Emergency Management Agency identified impact zones, which will result in a modest shift of approximately 10 million in net credit losses from the fourth quarter of 2024 to the second quarter of 2025, and therefore a slightly lower net loss rate in the fourth quarter and consequently an offsetting higher net loss rate in the second quarter of 2025. 
 
 In our 2024 financial outlook, we also expect our full year normalized effective tax rate, excluding the impact from our repurchased Convertible Notes, a Non-GAAP financial measure, to be in the range of 25 to 26 , with quarter-over-quarter variability due to the timing of certain discrete items. 
 
 We remain disciplined in our commitment to our capital priorities and are confident in our ability to adapt our business to potential regulatory and economic changes while achieving strong financial results. 
 
 Note: We are unable to provide a quantitative reconciliation of the forward-looking 2024 financial outlook for the Non-GAAP financial measures above, to their most directly comparable forward-looking GAAP measures, as we cannot reliably predict all of the necessary components of such forward-looking GAAP measures without unreasonable effort.

 Total Net Interest and Non-interest Income, After Provision for Credit Losses 
 
 Interest income: Total interest income decreased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, due to the following: 
 
 Interest and fees on loans decreased during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, due primarily to lower late fees driven by lower early-stage delinquency volumes and from our gradual shift in product mix to a lower proportion of private label accounts, as well as higher reversals of interest and fees resulting from higher gross credit losses; collectively decreasing finance charge and late fee yields by approximately 124 basis points and 13 basis points, respectively. 
 Interest on cash and investment securities increased during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, partially offsetting the decrease in Interest and fees on loans, due to higher average balances which increased interest income by 9 million and 16 million, respectively, as well as, during the nine month period, higher average interest rates which increased interest income by 9 million. 
 
 Interest expense: Total interest expense increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, due to the following: 
 
 Interest on deposits increased due to higher average interest rates which increased interest expense by 14 million and 76 million over the respective periods of comparison, partially offset by lower average wholesale deposit balances, which decreased funding costs by 4 million and 2 million over the respective periods of comparisons. 
 Interest on borrowings increased during the three month period due to higher average borrowings which increased funding costs by 7 million, as well as higher average interest rates which increased funding costs by 4 million. Whereas during the nine month period, Interest on borrowings increased due to higher average interest rates which 
 6 

Table of Contents 

increased funding costs by 38 million, partially offset by lower average borrowings which decreased funding costs by 24 million. 
 
 Non-interest income: Total non-interest income decreased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, due to the following: 
 
 Interchange revenue, net of retailer share arrangements , typically a contra-revenue item for us, increased for the three and nine month periods driven by a decrease in merchant discount fees, from lower big ticket credit sales, and interchange revenue earned, partially offset by a reduction in costs associated with brand partner retailer share arrangements. 
 Gain on portfolio sale reflects the gain we recognized from the sale of a credit card loan portfolio in April 2024, that was adjusted during the three months ended September 30, 2024 to recognize an incremental amount due under the purchase and sale agreement. For 2023, we recognized a gain from the sale of the BJ's Wholesale Club (BJ s) portfolio in late February 2023. 
 
 Provision for credit losses increased during the three months ended September 30, 2024, driven by a 22 million reserve build in the current year period compared with a flat reserve build in the prior year period. The increase in Provision for credit losses also includes net principal losses of 347 million and 304 million during those same respective periods. Provision for credit losses increased during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, driven by a 142 million reserve release in the current year period compared with a 251 million reserve release in the prior year period, with the release in the prior year period primarily related to the sale of the BJ's portfolio. The reserve releases in both years were offset by net principal losses of 1,122 million and 998 million during those same respective periods. Overall, we continue to maintain an elevated reserve rate, 12.2 as of September 30, 2024, reflecting a conservative weighting of economic scenarios in our credit reserve modeling, which we intend to maintain until we see sustained improvement in delinquencies and an improved macroeconomic outlook.

financial measure and has been adjusted for the 96 million impact from our repurchased Convertible Notes, decreased in both periods of comparison. 
 
 Employee compensation and benefits increased in both the three and nine month periods due to higher short-term and long-term incentive compensation, partially offset by ongoing strategic adjustments in customer care staffing, as well as a reduction in demand-based outsourced and contract labor. 
 Card and processing expenses decreased in both the three and nine month periods due primarily to lower fraud losses, as well as reduced volume-related card and statement costs. 
 Marketing expenses were essentially flat during the three month period and decreased during the nine month period due primarily to decreased spending associated with brand partner and BFH joint marketing campaigns, partially offset by higher spending associated with DTC product offerings. 
 Depreciation and amortization was essentially flat during the three month period and decreased during the nine month period due to lower amortization for developed technology associated with an acquisition completed in late 2020. 
 Other increased in both the three and nine month periods primarily related to the impact from our repurchased Convertible Notes; excluding that impact Other expenses decreased in both periods of comparison due to decreased legal and other business activity costs. 
 
 Income Taxes 
 
 The Provision for income taxes decreased for the three months ended September 30, 2024 primarily driven by a decrease in Income from continuing operations before income taxes. The effective tax rate was 92.2 and 23.0 for the three month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase in the effective tax rate resulted from an increase in nondeductible items in the current year period, primarily related to the nondeductible portion of our repurchased Convertible Notes transactions, and a favorable discrete item in the prior year period. The Provision for income taxes decreased for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily driven by a decrease in Income from continuing operations before income taxes in the current year relative to the prior year period, which itself was higher due to the gain on the sale of the BJ's portfolio. The effective tax rate was 33.4 and 27.1 for the nine month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase in the effective tax rate was also driven primarily by an increase in nondeductible items in the current year period related to the nondeductible portion of our repurchased Convertible Notes transactions. 
 
 Discontinued Operations 
 
 The Loss from discontinued operations, net of income taxes includes amounts that relate to the previously disclosed discontinued operations associated with the spinoff of our former LoyaltyOne segment in 2021 and the sale of our former Epsilon segment in 2019, and primarily relate to contractual indemnification and tax-related matters.

 Note: Beginning in 2024, we revised the calculation of average balances to more closely align with industry practice by incorporating an average daily balance. Prior to 2024, average balances represent the average balance at the beginning and end of each month, averaged over the periods indicated. 
 (1) PPNR represents Income from continuing operations before income taxes and the Provision for credit losses. PPNR is a Non-GAAP financial measure. PPNR excluding gain on portfolio sale and impact from repurchased Convertible Notes excludes from PPNR the gain on any portfolio sale in the period, as well as the impact from our repurchased Convertible Notes in the period, and is also a Non-GAAP financial measure. See Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Table 6: Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures . 
 (2) Return on average assets represents annualized Income from continuing operations divided by average Total assets. 
 (3) Return on average equity represents annualized Income from continuing operations divided by average Total stockholders equity. 
 (4) Return on average tangible common equity (ROTCE) represents annualized Income from continuing operations divided by average Tangible common equity. Tangible common equity (TCE) represents Total stockholders' equity reduced by Goodwill and intangible assets, net. ROTCE is a Non-GAAP financial measure. See Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Table 6: Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures . 
 (5) Net interest margin represents annualized Net interest income divided by average Total interest-earning assets. See also Table 5: Net Interest Margin . 
 (6) Loan yield represents annualized Interest and fees on loans divided by Average credit card and other loans.

Table of Contents 

(7) Efficiency ratio represents Total non-interest expenses divided by Total net interest and non-interest income. 
 (8) Double leverage ratio represents Parent Company investment in subsidiaries divided by BFH consolidated equity. 
 (9) Common equity tier 1 capital ratio represents tier 1 capital divided by total risk-weighted assets. In the calculation of tier 1 capital, we follow the Basel III Standardized Approach and therefore Total stockholders' equity has been reduced, primarily by Goodwill and intangible assets, net. For additional information, see Legislative, Regulatory Matters and Capital Adequacy included elsewhere in this report. 
 (10) Total risk-based capital ratio represents total capital divided by total risk-weighted assets. In the calculation of total capital, we follow the Basel III Standardized Approach and therefore tier 1 capital has been increased by tier 2 capital, which for us is the allowable portion of the Allowance for credit losses. For additional information, see Legislative, Regulatory Matters and Capital Adequacy included elsewhere in this report. 
 (11) Total risk-weighted assets are generally measured by allocating assets, and specified off-balance sheet exposures, to various risk categories as defined by the Basel III Standardized Approach. For additional information, see Legislative, Regulatory Matters and Capital Adequacy included elsewhere in this report. 
 (12) Tangible common equity over tangible assets (TCE/TA) represents TCE divided by Tangible assets (TA), which is Total assets reduced by Goodwill and intangible assets, net. TCE/TA is a Non-GAAP financial measure. See Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Table 6: Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures . 
 (13) Tangible book value per common share represents TCE divided by shares outstanding and is a Non-GAAP financial measure. See Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Table 6: Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures . 
 (14) Payment rate represents consumer payments during the last month of the period, divided by the beginning-of-month Credit card and other loans, including held for sale in applicable periods. 
 (15) Delinquency rate represents outstanding balances that are contractually delinquent (i.e., balances greater than 30 days past due) as of the end of the period, divided by the outstanding principal amount of Credit card and other loans as of the same period-end. 
 (16) Net loss rate, an annualized rate, represents net principal losses for the period divided by Average credit card and other loans for the same period. Net loss rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 was impacted by the transition of our credit card processing services in June 2022. 
 (17) Reserve rate represents the Allowance for credit losses divided by End-of-period credit card and other loans.

ASSET QUALITY 
 
 Given the nature of our business, the credit quality of our assets, in particular our Credit card and other loans, is a key determinant underlying our ongoing financial performance and overall financial condition. When it comes to our Credit card and other loans portfolio, we closely monitor Delinquency rates and Net principal loss rates, which reflect, among other factors, our underwriting, the inherent credit risk in our portfolio and the success of our collection and recovery efforts. These rates also reflect, more broadly, the general macroeconomic conditions, including the compounding effect of persistent inflation relative to wage growth, and higher interest rates. Our Delinquency and Net principal loss rates are also impacted by the size of our Credit card and other loans portfolio, which serves as the denominator in the calculation of these rates. Accordingly, changes in the size of our portfolio (whether due to credit tightening, acquisitions or dispositions of portfolios or otherwise) may cause movements in our Delinquency and Net principal loss rates that are not necessarily indicative of the underlying credit quality of the overall portfolio. 
 
 Delinquencies: An account is contractually delinquent if we do not receive the minimum payment due by the specified due date. Our policy is to continue to accrue interest and fee income on all accounts, except in limited circumstances, until the balance and all related interest and fees are paid or charged-off. After an account becomes 30 days past due, a proprietary collection scoring algorithm automatically scores the risk of the account becoming further delinquent; based upon the level of risk indicated, a collection strategy is deployed. If after exhausting all in-house collection efforts we are unable to collect on the account, we may engage collection agencies or outside attorneys to continue those efforts, or sell the charged-off balances. 
 
 The Delinquency rate is calculated by dividing outstanding principal balances that are contractually delinquent (i.e., balances greater than 30 days past due) as of the end of the period, by the outstanding principal amount of Credit card and other loans as of the same period-end. 
 
 The following table provides the delinquency trends on our Credit card and other loans portfolio based on the principal balances outstanding as of the dates presented:

As part of our collections strategy, we may offer temporary and short term programs in order to improve the likelihood of collections and meet the needs of our customers. Our modifications, for customers who have requested assistance and meet certain qualifying requirements, come in the form of reduced payment requirements, interest rate reductions and late fee waivers. We do not offer programs involving the forgiveness of principal. These temporary loan modifications may assist in cases where we believe the customer will recover from the short-term hardship and resume scheduled payments. Under these consumer relief programs, those accounts receiving relief may not advance to the next delinquency cycle, including charge-off, in the same time frame that would have occurred had the relief not been granted. We evaluate our consumer relief programs to determine if they represent a more than insignificant delay in payment granted to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty, in which case they would then be considered a Loan Modification. For additional information, see Note 2 Credit Card and Other Loans Modified Credit Card Loans to our unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 
 Net Principal Losses: Our net principal losses include the principal amount of losses that are deemed uncollectible, less recoveries, and exclude charged-off interest, fees and third-party fraud losses (including synthetic fraud). Charged-off interest and fees reduce Interest and fees on loans, while third-party fraud losses are recorded in Card and processing expenses. Credit card loans, including unpaid interest and fees, are generally charged-off in the month during which an account becomes 180 days past due. BNPL loans such as our installment loans and our split-pay offerings, including unpaid interest, are generally charged-off when a loan becomes 120 days past due. However, in the case of a customer bankruptcy or death, Credit card and other loans, including unpaid interest and fees, as applicable, are charged-off 60 days after receipt of the notification of the bankruptcy or death, but in any case no later than 180 days past due for credit card loans and 120 days past due for BNPL loans. 
 
 The net principal loss rate is calculated by dividing net principal losses for the period by the Average credit card and other loans for the same period. Beginning in January 2024, we revised the calculation of Average credit card and other loans to more closely align with industry practice by incorporating an average daily balance. Prior to 2024, Average credit card and other loans represent the average balance of the loans at the beginning and end of each month, averaged over the periods indicated. The following table provides our net principal losses for the periods presented:

CONSOLIDATED LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 
 Overview 
 
 We maintain a strong focus on liquidity and capital. Our funding, liquidity and capital policies are designed to ensure that our business has sufficient liquidity and capital resources necessary to support our daily operations, our business growth, and our credit ratings related to our Parent Company s senior unsecured notes and our public secured financings, and meet our regulatory and policy requirements, including capital and leverage ratio requirements applicable to Comenity Bank (CB) and Comenity Capital Bank (CCB) under Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) regulations, in a cost effective and prudent manner through both expected and unexpected market environments. We also monitor our Double Leverage Ratio, which reflects our Parent Company s investment in its subsidiaries relative to its consolidated equity, and is often used by regulators and other stakeholders as a measure of the use of debt by a parent entity to fund its subsidiaries. 
 
 14 

Table of Contents 

Our primary sources of liquidity include cash generated from operating activities, our bank credit facility, issuances of senior unsecured or convertible debt securities by our Parent Company, financings through our securitization programs, and deposits with the Banks. More broadly, we continuously evaluate opportunities to renew and expand our various sources of liquidity. We aim to satisfy our financing needs with a diverse set of funding sources, and we seek to maintain diversity of funding sources by type of instrument, by tenor and by investor base, among other factors, which we believe will mitigate the impact of disruptions in any one type of instrument, tenor or investor. 
 
 Our primary uses of liquidity are for underwriting Credit card and other loans, scheduled payments of principal and interest on our debt, operational expenses, capital expenditures, including digital and product innovation and technology enhancements, stock repurchases and dividends. 
 
 We may from time to time retire or purchase our outstanding debt or convertible debt securities through cash purchases or exchanges for other securities, in open market purchases, tender offers, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Such repurchases or exchanges would depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors, and may be funded through cash on hand, borrowings under our revolving credit facility, the issuance of debt or convertible debt securities or other sources of liquidity. The amounts involved may be material. 
 
 We will also need additional financing in the future to repay or refinance our existing debt at or prior to maturity, and to fund our growth, which may include issuance of additional debt, equity or convertible securities or engaging in other capital markets or financing transactions. Given the maturities of certain of our outstanding debt instruments and the macroeconomic outlook, it is possible that we will be required to repay, extend or refinance some or all of our maturing debt in volatile and/or unfavorable markets. 
 
 Because of the alternatives available to us, as discussed above, we believe our short-term and long-term sources of liquidity are adequate to fund not only our current operations, but also our near-term and long-term funding requirements including dividend payments, debt service obligations and repayment of debt maturities and other amounts that may ultimately be paid in connection with contingencies. However, the adequacy of our liquidity could be impacted by various factors, including pending or future legislation, regulation or litigation, macroeconomic conditions and volatility in the financial and capital markets, limiting our access to or increasing our cost of capital, which could make capital unavailable, or available but on terms that are unfavorable to us. These factors could significantly reduce our financial flexibility and cause us to contract or not grow our business, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. 
 
 We have a robust liquidity risk management framework in place which includes ongoing monitoring of our liquidity and funding positions against our risk appetite metrics and key risk indicators. During times where there may be potential risks from adverse developments in the banking industry and/or increased financial sector volatility, we may invoke our contingency funding plan to enhance daily monitoring of our liquidity and funding positions, determine potential mitigating actions if necessary and provide enhanced reporting to our Boards of Directors, at both the Bread Financial and Bank-levels, and regulators. 
 
 We maintain a significant majority of our liquidity portfolio on deposit within the Federal Reserve banking system, and we also have a small investment securities portfolio, classified as available-for-sale, which we hold in relation to the Community Reinvestment Act. We do not have any investment securities classified as held-to-maturity. 
 
 Credit Ratings 
 
 In November 2023, we obtained credit ratings for our Parent Company from the major credit rating agencies, Moody s Investor Services (Moody s), Standard Poor s (S P) and Fitch Ratings (Fitch), in order to facilitate debt financings and broaden the investor base for our Parent Company debt securities. 
 
 Our management approach is designed, among other things, to maintain appropriate and stable Parent Company senior unsecured debt ratings from the credit rating agencies which help support our access to cost-effective unsecured funding as a component of our overall liquidity and capital resources.

 Credit ratings are not a recommendation to buy or hold any securities and they may be revised or revoked at any time at the sole discretion of the rating agency. Downgrades in the ratings of our unsecured or secured debt could result in higher funding costs, as well as reductions in our borrowing capacity in the unsecured or secured debt markets. We believe our mix of funding, including the proportion of our DTC and wholesale deposits, to total funding, reduces the impact that a credit rating downgrade could have on our funding costs and capacity. 
 
 Funding Sources 
 
 As referenced above, our primary sources of liquidity include cash generated from operating activities, our bank credit facility, issuances of senior unsecured or convertible debt securities by our Parent Company, financings through our securitization programs, and deposits with the Banks. 
 
 Certain of our long-term debt agreements include various restrictive financial and non-financial covenants. If we do not comply with certain of these covenants and an event of default occurs and remains uncured, the maturity of amounts outstanding may be accelerated and become payable, and, with respect to our credit agreement, the associated commitments may be terminated. As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with all such covenants. 
 
 Credit Agreement 
 
 In June 2023, we entered into our credit agreement with Parent Company, as borrower, certain of our domestic subsidiaries, as guarantors, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent and lender, and various other financial institutions, as lenders, which provides for a 700 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the Revolving Credit Facility). As of September 30, 2024, all 700 million remained available for future borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility. 
 
 On October 18, 2024, we amended our Revolving Credit Facility to extend the maturity date from June 13, 2026 to October 18, 2028, as well as to delete the provisions relating to our prior term loan facility (which was repaid in full and terminated in December 2023) and make certain other amendments. 
 
 4.25 Convertible Senior Notes Due 2028 
 
 In June 2023, we issued and sold 316 million aggregate principal amount of 4.25 Convertible Senior Notes due 2028 (the Convertible Notes). The Convertible Notes bear interest at an annual rate of 4.25 , payable semi-annually in arrears on June 15 and December 15 of each year. The Convertible Notes mature on June 15, 2028, unless earlier repurchased, redeemed or converted. In connection with the issuance of the Convertible Notes, we entered into privately negotiated capped call (Capped Call) transactions with certain financial institution counterparties. These transactions are expected generally to reduce potential dilution to our common stock upon any conversion of Convertible Notes and/or offset any cash payments we are required to make in excess of the principal amount of the Convertible Notes, with such reduction and/or offset subject to a cap, based on the cap price. For additional information on the issuance of our Convertible Notes

and our Capped Call transactions, see Consolidated Liquidity and Capital Resources under Part II of our 2023 Form 10-K. 
 
 In August 2024 we entered into separate, privately negotiated repurchase agreements with a limited number of Convertible Note holders to repurchase 238 million aggregate principal amount of our outstanding Convertible Notes for a final aggregate cash repurchase price of 374 million, which was funded with cash on hand. The final aggregate cash repurchase price, or settlement value, was subject to adjustment as a portion of the repurchase price for select repurchases was based in part on the daily volume-weighted average price per share of Parent Company s common stock over an agreed measurement period beginning in August 2024 and ending in September 2024. In connection with these aggregate repurchases, we recognized an 87 million inducement expense in Other non-interest expenses representing the total settlement value, inclusive of transaction fees, in excess of the total conversion value (calculated in accordance with the indenture governing the Convertible Notes), as well as a 60 million reduction in Additional paid-in capital (APIC) related to the total conversion value paid in excess of the carrying value of the Convertible Notes repurchased and a deferred tax impact. 
 
 In September 2024 we entered into two additional separate, privately negotiated repurchase agreements with holders of our Convertible Notes who approached us to repurchase 25 million aggregate principal amount of our outstanding Convertible Notes for a final aggregate cash repurchase price of 38 million, which was funded with cash on hand. The final aggregate cash repurchase price, or settlement value, was subject to adjustment as a portion of the repurchase price was based in part on the daily volume-weighted average price per share of Parent Company s common stock over an agreed measurement period during September 2024. In connection with these aggregate repurchases, we recognized a 9 million inducement expense in Other non-interest expenses representing the total settlement value, inclusive of transaction fees, in excess of the total conversion value (calculated in accordance with the indenture governing the Convertible Notes), as well as a 7 million reduction in APIC related to the total conversion value paid in excess of the carrying value of the Convertible Notes repurchased and a deferred tax impact. 
 
 In summary, in total through August and September 2024, we recognized a 96 million inducement expense in Other non-interest expenses representing the settlement value, inclusive of transaction fees, in excess of the conversion value, and a 67 million reduction in APIC representing the excess of the conversion value over the carrying value of the Convertible Notes repurchased and a deferred tax impact. 
 
 Following the settlement of these repurchases, 54 million of Convertible Notes remained outstanding as of September 30, 2024. We may, from time to time, seek to retire or repurchase our remaining outstanding Convertible Notes through cash purchases or exchanges for other securities, in open market purchases, tender offers, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. 
 
 Beginning on October 1, 2024, the Convertible Notes became convertible at the option of the holders during the quarterly period ending December 31, 2024, due to the last reported sales price per share of Parent Company s common stock having exceeded 130 of the conversion price for each of at least 20 trading days, whether or not consecutive, during the 30 consecutive trading days ending on, and including, the last trading day of the immediately preceding quarter i.e., the quarter ended September 30, 2024 (the Common Stock Sale Price Condition). The Common Stock Sale Price Condition is remeasured each quarter, so the Convertible Notes may continue or cease to be convertible in future quarters depending on the performance of our stock price. Upon any such conversion, we will pay cash up to the aggregate principal amount of the Convertible Notes to be converted and pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, shares of our common stock, or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock (at our election), in respect of the remainder, if any, of our conversion obligation in excess of the aggregate principal amount of the Convertible Notes being converted. As of the date of this report, we have not received any conversion requests. 
 
 All of the Capped Call transactions continue to remain outstanding, notwithstanding the repurchases noted above. Although we do not trade or speculate in derivatives, the Capped Call transactions are expected to remain outstanding, possibly until maturity, with the objective of optimizing the economic value we receive under these transactions, in line with our strategic objectives designed to potentially offset certain of the economic impacts of the Convertible Notes.

9.750 Senior Notes due 2029 
 
 In January 2024, we issued and sold an additional 300 million aggregate principal amount of 9.750 Senior Notes due 2029 (Senior Notes due 2029) at an issue price of 101.00 of principal plus accrued interest from December 22, 2023. The Senior Notes due 2029 issued in January 2024 were issued as additional notes under the same indenture pursuant to which the initial 600 million of Senior Notes due 2029 were issued on December 22, 2023. The Senior Notes due 2029 that were issued in both December 2023 and January 2024 constitute a single series of notes and have the same terms, other than the issue date and issue price. We used the proceeds of the January 2024 offering of Senior Notes due 2029, together with 100 million of cash on hand, to fund the redemption of 400 million in aggregate principal amount of our outstanding 7.000 Senior Notes due 2026. 
 
 Deposits 
 
 We utilize a variety of deposit products to finance our operating activities, including funding for our non-securitized credit card and other loans, and to fund the securitization enhancement requirements of the Banks. We offer DTC retail deposit products, including Individual Retirement Account savings and certificates of deposit which CCB began offering in June 2024, as well as deposits sourced through contractual arrangements with various financial counterparties (often referred to as wholesale deposits, and includes brokered deposits). Across both our retail and wholesale deposits, the Banks offer various non-maturity deposit products that are generally redeemable on demand by the customer, and as such have no scheduled maturity date. The Banks also issue certificates of deposit with scheduled maturity dates ranging between October 2024 and September 2029, in denominations of at least 1,000, on which interest is paid either monthly or at maturity. The following table summarizes our retail and wholesale deposit products by type and associated attributes as of the dates presented: 
 
 Table 9: Deposits

 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, deposits that exceeded applicable FDIC insurance limits, which are generally 250,000 per depositor, per insured bank, per ownership category, were estimated to be 543 million (4 of Total deposits) and 509 million (4 of Total deposits), respectively. The measurement of estimated uninsured deposits aligns with regulatory guidelines. 
 
 Overall, we continue to improve our funding mix through actions taken to grow our DTC deposits and reduce our Parent Company unsecured borrowings, while maintaining the flexibility of secured, unsecured, and wholesale funding. Typical seasonality of credit card and other loan balance pay downs in the first quarter of each year, and efforts undertaken in 2024

to reduce our long-term unsecured debt, lowered our funding requirements by approximately 1.5 billion from year-end 2023. As a result, we opportunistically reduced our wholesale and brokered deposits, repurchased a portion of our outstanding Convertible Notes and paid down a portion of our secured conduit line balances, shown further below. 
 
 Securitization Programs Including Conduit Facilities 
 
 We sell the majority of the credit card loans originated by the Banks to certain of our master trusts (the Trusts). These securitization programs are a principal vehicle through which we finance the Banks credit card loans. For this purpose, we use a combination of public term asset-backed notes and private conduit facilities (the Conduit Facilities) with a consortium of lenders, including domestic money center, regional and international banks. Borrowings under the Conduit Facilities are included in Debt issued by consolidated VIEs in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
 
 The table below summarizes our conduit capacities, borrowings and maturities for the periods presented:

 (6) Amounts drawn do not include 0.7 billion and 1.2 billion of debt issued by the Trusts as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, which were not sold, but were retained by us as a credit enhancement and therefore have been eliminated from the Total. 
 
 In May 2024, WFNMNT issued 570 million of Series 2024-A public term asset-backed notes, which mature in April 2027. The offering consisted of 500 million of Class A notes with a fixed interest rate of 5.47 per year, 44 million of zero coupon Class M notes, and 26 million of zero coupon Class B notes. The Class M and B notes were retained by us and eliminated from the Consolidated Balance Sheet. As well, in August 2024 WFNMNT issued 500 million of Series 2024-B public term asset-backed notes, which mature in July 2027. The offering consisted of 500 million of Class A notes with a fixed interest rate of 4.62 per year. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had approximately 11.6 billion of securitized credit card loans. Securitizations require credit enhancements in the form of cash, spread deposits, additional loans and subordinated classes. The credit enhancement is principally based on the outstanding balances of the series issued by the Trusts and by the performance of the credit card loans in the Trusts. 
 
 Early amortization events as defined within each asset-backed securitization transaction are generally driven by asset performance. We do not believe it is reasonably likely that an early amortization event will occur due to asset performance. However, if an early amortization event were declared for a Trust, the trustee of the particular Trust would retain the interest in the loans along with the excess spread that would otherwise be paid to our Bank subsidiary until the investors were fully repaid. The occurrence of an early amortization event would significantly limit or negate our ability to securitize additional credit card loans.

We have secured and continue to secure the necessary commitments to fund our credit card and other loans. However, certain of these commitments are short-term in nature and subject to renewal. There is no guarantee that these funding sources, when they mature, will be renewed on similar terms, or at all, as they are dependent on the availability of the asset-backed securitization and deposit markets at the time. 
 
 Regulation RR (Credit Risk Retention) adopted by the FDIC, the SEC, the Federal Reserve Board and certain other federal regulators mandates a minimum five percent risk retention requirement for securitizations. Such risk retention requirements may limit our liquidity by restricting the amount of asset-backed securities we are able to issue or affecting the timing of future issuances of asset-backed securities. We satisfy such risk retention requirements by maintaining a seller s interest calculated in accordance with Regulation RR. 
 
 Stock Repurchase Programs 
 
 On February 21, 2024, our Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program to acquire up to 30 million in shares of our outstanding common stock in the open market during the period ending on December 31, 2024. The rationale for this repurchase program, and the amount thereof, was to offset the impact of dilution associated with issuances of employee restricted stock units, with the objective of reducing the Company s weighted average diluted share count to approximately 50 million shares for 2024, subject to then current estimates and assumptions applicable as of the date of approval. 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, under the authorized stock repurchase program, we acquired a total of 0.3 million shares of our common stock for 11 million. Following their repurchase, these 0.3 million shares ceased to be outstanding shares of common stock and are now treated as authorized but unissued shares of common stock. As of September 30, 2024, we had 19 million remaining for future repurchases under the authorized stock repurchase program. 
 
 Dividends 
 
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we paid 10 million and 32 million in dividends to holders of our common stock. O n October 24, 2024 , our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of 0.21 per share on our common stock, payable on December 13, 2024, to stockholders of record at the close of business on November 8, 2024. 
 
 Contractual Obligations 
 
 In the normal course of business, we enter into various contractual obligations that may require future cash payments, the vast majority of which relate to deposits, debt issued by consolidated VIEs, long-term and other debt and operating leases. 
 
 We believe that we will have access to sufficient resources to meet these commitments. 
 
 Cash Flows 
 
 The table below summarizes our cash flow activity for the periods indicated, followed by a discussion of the variance drivers impacting our Operating, Investing and Financing activities: 
 
 Table 11: Cash Flows 
 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 (Millions) Total cash used in: Operating activities 1,380 1,370 Investing activities 182 2,579 Financing activities (1,707) (4,481) Net decrease in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash (145) (532) 
 
 20 

Table of Contents 

Cash Flows from Operating Activities primarily include net income adjusted for (i) non-cash items included in net income, such as provision for credit losses, depreciation and amortization, deferred taxes and other non-cash items, and (ii) changes in the balances of operating assets and liabilities, which can fluctuate in the normal course of business due to the amount and timing of payments. We generated cash flows from operating activities of 1,380 million and 1,370 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The net cash provided by operating activities during these periods was primarily driven by cash generated from net income for the periods after adjusting for the Provision for credit losses in both periods of comparison, and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Loss on debt extinguishment and repurchased Convertible Notes and for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Gain on portfolio sale. 
 
 Cash Flows from Investing Activities primarily include changes in Credit card and other loans. Cash provided by investing activities was 182 million and 2,579 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The net cash provided by investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to the paydown of Credit card and other loans, as well as the sale of a credit card loan portfolio, partially offset by the purchase of a credit card loan portfolio. The net cash provided by investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to the sale of the BJ's portfolio and the paydown of Credit card and other loans. 
 
 Cash Flows from Financing Activities primarily include changes in deposits and long-term debt. Cash used in financing activities was 1,707 million and 4,481 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The net cash used in financing activities during these periods was primarily driven by net repayments of both debt issued by consolidated variable interest entities (securitizations) and unsecured borrowings, including our repurchased Convertible Notes, as well as a net decrease in wholesale deposits. 

INFLATION AND SEASONALITY 
 
 Although we cannot precisely determine the impact of inflation on our operations, we have generally sought to rely on operating efficiencies from scale, technology modernization and digital advancement, and expansion in lower cost jurisdictions (in select circumstances) to offset increased costs of employee compensation and other operating expenses impacted by inflation. We also recognize that a customer s ability and willingness to repay us has been negatively impacted by factors such as inflation and the effects of higher interest rates, which results in higher delinquencies that could lead to increased credit losses, as reflected in our elevated Reserve rate. If the efforts to control inflation in the U.S. and globally are not successful and inflationary pressures continue to persist, they could increase the risk of a recession, which may adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
 
 With respect to seasonality, our revenues, earnings and cash flows are affected by increased consumer spending patterns leading up to and including the holiday shopping season in the fourth quarter of each year and, to a lesser extent, during the first quarter of each year as Credit card and other loans are paid down. Net loss rates for our Credit card and other loans portfolio also have historically exhibited seasonal patterns and generally tend to be the highest in the first quarter of the year. While the effects of the seasonal trends discussed above remain evident, macroeconomic trends, such as those discussed within the Business Environment sections of our quarterly and annual reports on Forms 10-Q and Form 10-K generally have a more significant impact on our key financial metrics and can outweigh any seasonal impacts that we may experience. 

LEGISLATIVE, REGULATORY MATTERS AND CAPITAL ADEQUACY 
 
 CB is subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the State of Delaware and the FDIC. CCB is also subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the State of Utah and the FDIC. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can trigger certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by our regulators. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, both Banks must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of their assets and liabilities as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. The capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by these regulators about components, risk weightings and other factors. In addition, both Banks are limited in the amounts they can pay as dividends to the Parent Company. For additional information about legislative and regulatory matters impacting us, see Business Supervision and Regulation under Part I of our 2023 Form 10-K. For additional detail regarding the CFPB s final rule relating to credit card late fees, see Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD A) Business Environment and Risk Factors included herein and in our 2023 Form 10-K and our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2024.

As referenced above, our business is subject to extensive federal and state laws and regulations, as well as related regulation and supervision, including by the FDIC, CFPB and other federal and state authorities. Pending and future laws and regulations (state and federal) may adversely impact our business. We actively monitor legislation and rulemaking that could impact our business and operations, including the FDIC s proposed rulemakings during the quarter. Among other rulemakings, in August 2024 the FDIC issued (i) proposed rule changes that would expand the scope of deposits that constitute brokered deposits, which are subject to greater regulatory requirements (the Proposed Brokered Deposits Rule), and (ii) proposed rule changes that would permit the FDIC to determine that parent companies of legacy industrial banks/loan companies (such as CCB) are covered companies subjecting them to regulation by the FDIC (the Proposed ILC Parent Company Rule). We have submitted a comment letter to the FDIC in opposition to the Proposed ILC Parent Company Rule, and we intend to participate in the comment letter process in opposition to the Proposed Brokered Deposits Rule. 
 
 Quantitative measures, established by regulations to ensure capital adequacy, require the Banks to maintain minimum amounts and ratios of Tier 1 capital to average assets, and Common equity tier 1, Tier 1 capital and Total capital, all to risk weighted assets. Failure to meet these minimum capital requirements can result in certain mandatory, and possibly additional discretionary actions by the Banks regulators that if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on CB s and/or CCB s operating activities, as well as our operating activities. Based on these regulations, as of September 30, 2024 and 2023, each Bank met all capital requirements to which it was subject, and maintained capital ratios in excess of the minimums required to qualify as well capitalized. The Banks seek to maintain capital levels and ratios in excess of the minimum regulatory requirements inclusive of the 2.5 Capital Conservation Buffer. Although Bread Financial is not a bank holding company as defined under the Bank Holding Company Act, we seek to maintain capital levels and ratios in excess of the minimums required for bank holding companies. 
 
 The Banks adopted the option provided by the interim final rule issued by joint federal bank regulatory agencies, which largely delayed the effects of the current expected credit loss (CECL) model on their regulatory capital for two years, until January 1, 2022, after which the effects are phased-in over a three-year period through December 31, 2024. Under the interim final rule, the amount of adjustments to regulatory capital deferred until the phase-in period includes both the initial impact of our adoption of CECL as of January 1, 2020, and 25 of subsequent changes in our Allowance for credit losses during each quarter of the two-year period ended December 31, 2021. In accordance with the interim final rule, we began to ratably phase-in these effects on January 1, 2022.

 We are also involved, from time to time, in reviews, investigations, subpoenas, supervisory actions and other proceedings (both formal and informal) by governmental agencies regarding our business, which could subject us to significant fines, penalties, obligations to change our business practices, significant restrictions on our existing business or ability to develop new business, cease-and-desist orders, safety-and-soundness directives or other requirements resulting in increased expenses, diminished income and damage to our reputation. 
 
 On November 20, 2023, following the consent of the Board of Managers of Comenity Servicing LLC (the Servicer), the FDIC issued a consent order to the Servicer. The Servicer is not one of our Bank subsidiaries, but is our wholly-owned subsidiary that services substantially all of our loans. The consent order arose out of the June 2022 transition of our credit card processing services to strategic outsourcing partners and addresses certain shortcomings in the Servicer s information technology (IT) systems development, project management, business continuity management, cloud operations, and third-party oversight. The Servicer entered into the consent order for the purpose of resolving these matters without admitting or denying any violations of law or regulation set forth in the order. The consent order does not contain any monetary penalties or fines. 
 
 The Servicer continues to take significant steps to strengthen the organization s IT governance and address the other issues identified in the consent order, working diligently to ensure that all of the requirements of the consent order are satisfied. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Servicer has taken steps to address each provision within the consent order that required action be taken by a specified deadline, including providing a copy of the consent order to the Parent Company Board of Directors, increasing the size and governance processes of the Servicer s Board of Managers, establishing an Executive Oversight Committee to oversee and ensure compliance with the consent order, and submitting all required reports and plans of action to the FDIC. The Servicer is committed to complying with each of the ongoing or longer-term requirements of the consent order, including the enhancement of its compliance management processes and related corporate governance, compliance with the applicable system conversion requirements, and enhanced risk management and reporting requirements. In addition, the Board of Directors of each of the Banks oversee the Servicer s compliance with the requirements of the consent order and provide effective challenge of Servicer management toward that end. 
 
 On August 22, 2024, each Bank entered into an agreement with the FDIC to pay civil money penalties (CMPs) of 1 million per Bank. The CMPs arose out of the June 2022 transition of our credit card processing services to strategic outsourcing partners and were related to disruptions to the Banks customer reward programs and automatic payments following the transition. These issues were self-identified and remediated timely, and the Banks provided full cooperation with the regulators throughout their examination. The Banks agreements to pay the CMPs did not require admission of wrongdoing, and there are no operational limitations on the Banks or our business associated with the CMPs.

Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements 
 
 This Form 10-Q and the documents incorporated by reference herein contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Forward-looking statements give our expectations or forecasts of future events and can generally be identified by the use of words such as believe, expect, anticipate, estimate, intend, project, plan, likely, may, should or other words or phrases of similar import. Similarly, statements that describe our business strategy, outlook, objectives, plans, intentions or goals also are forward-looking statements. Examples of forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements we make regarding, and the guidance we give with respect to, our anticipated operating or financial results, future financial performance and outlook, future dividend declarations and future economic conditions. 
 
 We believe that our expectations are based on reasonable assumptions. Forward-looking statements, however, are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that are difficult to predict and, in many cases, beyond our control. Accordingly, our actual results could differ materially from the projections, anticipated results or other expectations expressed in this report, and no assurances can be given that our expectations will prove to have been correct. Factors that could cause the outcomes to differ materially include, but are not limited to, the following: 
 
 macroeconomic conditions, including market conditions, inflation, higher interest rates, labor market conditions, recessionary pressures or a concern over a prolonged economic slowdown, and the related impact on consumer spending behavior, payments, debt levels, savings rates and other behavior; 
 global political, market, public health and social events or conditions, including ongoing wars and military conflicts and natural disasters; 
 future credit performance of our customers, including the level of future delinquency and write-off rates; 
 loss of, or reduction in demand for services from, significant brand partners or customers in the highly competitive markets in which we compete; 
 the concentration of our business in U.S. consumer credit; 
 increases or volatility in the Allowance for credit losses that may result from the application of the CECL model; 
 inaccuracies in the models and estimates on which we rely, including the amount of our Allowance for credit losses and our credit risk management models; 
 increases in fraudulent activity; 
 failure to identify, complete or successfully integrate or disaggregate business acquisitions, divestitures and other strategic initiatives; 
 the extent to which our results are dependent upon our brand partners, including our brand partners financial performance and reputation, as well as the effective promotion and support of our products by brand partners; 
 continued financial responsibility with respect to a divested business, including required equity ownership, guarantees, indemnities or other financial obligations; 
 increases in the cost of doing business, including market interest rates; 
 our level of indebtedness and inability to access financial or capital markets, including asset-backed securitization funding or deposits markets; 
 restrictions that limit our Banks ability to pay dividends to us; 
 pending and future litigation; 
 pending and future federal and state legislation, regulation, supervisory guidance and regulatory and legal actions including, but not limited to, those related to financial regulatory reform and consumer financial services practices, as well as any such actions with respect to late fees, interchange fees or other charges; 
 increases in regulatory capital requirements or other support for our Banks; 
 impacts arising from or relating to the transition of our credit card processing services to third party service providers that we completed in 2022; 
 failures or breaches in our operational or security systems, including as a result of cyberattacks, unanticipated impacts from technology modernization projects, failure of our information security controls or otherwise; 
 loss of consumer information or other data due to compromised physical or cyber security, including disruptive attacks from financially motivated bad actors and third party supply chain issues; 
 any tax or other liability or adverse impacts arising out of or related to the spinoff of our former LoyaltyOne segment or the bankruptcy filings of Loyalty Ventures Inc. (LVI) and certain of its subsidiaries and subsequent litigation or other disputes; and

those factors identified in our filings with the SEC, including in the Risk Factors and Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations sections of our 2023 Form 10-K, our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2024 and our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2024. 
 
 If one or more of these or other risks or uncertainties materialize, or if our underlying assumptions prove to be incorrect, actual results may vary materially from what we projected. In addition, the CFPB issued a final rule earlier this year that, absent a successful legal challenge, will place significant limits on credit card late fees, which would have a significant impact on our business and results of operations for at least the short term and, depending on the effectiveness of the mitigating actions that we have taken or may in the future take in anticipation of, or in response to, the final rule, may potentially adversely impact us over the long term; we cannot provide any assurance as to the effective date of the rule, the result of any pending or future challenges or other litigation relating to the rule, or our ability to mitigate or offset the impact of the rule on our business and results of operations. 
 
 Any forward-looking statements contained in this Form 10-Q speak only as of the date made, and we undertake no obligation, other than as required by applicable law, to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, subsequent events, anticipated or unanticipated circumstances or otherwise.

 Credit Quality Indicators for Our Credit Card and Other Loans 
 
 Given the nature of our business, the credit quality of our assets, in particular our Credit card and other loans, is a key determinant underlying our ongoing financial performance and overall financial condition. When it comes to our Credit card and other loans portfolio, we closely monitor Delinquency rates and Net principal loss rates, which reflect, among other factors, our underwriting, the inherent credit risk in our portfolio and the success of our collection and recovery efforts. These rates also reflect, more broadly, the general macroeconomic conditions, including the compounding effect of persistent inflation relative to wage growth, and higher interest rates. Our Delinquency and Net principal loss rates are also impacted by the size of our Credit card and other loans portfolio, which serves as the denominator in the calculation of these rates. Accordingly, changes in the size of our portfolio (whether due to credit tightening, acquisitions or dispositions of portfolios or otherwise) may cause movements in our Delinquency and Net principal loss rates that are not necessarily indicative of the underlying credit quality of the overall portfolio. 
 
 Delinquencies: An account is contractually delinquent if we do not receive the minimum payment due by the specified due date. Our policy is to continue to accrue interest and fee income on all accounts, except in limited circumstances, until the balance and all related interest and fees are paid or charged-off. After an account becomes days past due, a proprietary collection scoring algorithm automatically scores the risk of the account becoming further delinquent; based upon the level of risk indicated, a collection strategy is deployed. If after exhausting all in-house collection efforts we are unable to collect on the account, we may engage collection agencies or outside attorneys to continue those efforts, or sell the charged-off balances. 
 
 The Delinquency rate is calculated by dividing outstanding principal balances that are contractually delinquent (i.e., balances greater than 30 days past due) as of the end of the period, by the outstanding principal amount of Credit card and other loans as of the same period-end. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, our Delinquency rates were and , respectively. 
 
 Net Principal Losses: Our net principal losses include the principal amount of losses that are deemed uncollectible, less recoveries, and exclude charged-off interest, fees and third-party fraud losses (including synthetic fraud). Charged-off interest and fees reduce Interest and fees on loans, while third-party fraud losses are recorded in Card and processing expenses. Credit card loans, including unpaid interest and fees, are generally charged-off in the month during which an account becomes 180 days past due. BNPL loans such as our installment loans and our split-pay offerings, including unpaid interest, are generally charged-off when a loan becomes 120 days past due. However, in the case of a customer bankruptcy or death, Credit card and other loans, including unpaid interest and fees, as applicable, are charged-off 60 days after receipt of the notification of the bankruptcy or death, but in any case no later than 180 days past due for credit card loans and 120 days past due for BNPL loans. We record the actual losses for unpaid interest and fees as a reduction to Interest and fees on loans, which were million and million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and million and million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 
 The net principal loss rate is calculated by dividing net principal losses for the period by the Average credit card and other loans for the same period. Beginning in January 2024, we revised the calculation of Average credit card and other loans to more closely align with industry practice by incorporating an average daily balance. Prior to 2024, Average credit card and other loans represent the average balance of the loans at the beginning and end of each month, averaged over the periods indicated. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, our Net principal loss rates were and , respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, our Net Principal loss rates were and , respectively.

 of the total credit card loans balance as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, representing those customer accounts for which a Vantage credit score is not available. 

As part of our credit risk management activities for our BNPL loans portfolio, we also assess overall credit quality by reviewing information from credit bureaus. We have historically utilized Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO) credit scores to assist in our assessment of the credit quality for our BNPL loans portfolio, but in early 2024 we completed a transition to Vantage scoring. The scoring scale produced by both FICO and Vantage is similar in that scores of 600 or less are considered weaker scores and as per our categorization method would have the highest credit risk. The amortized cost basis of BNPL loans totaled million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, approximately of these loans were originated with customers with scores of 661 or above, and correspondingly approximately of these loans were originated with customers with scores below 661. Similarly, as of December 31, 2023, approximately and of these loans were originated with customers with scores of 661 or above, and below 661, respectively. 
 
 Modified Credit Card Loans 
 
 Consumer Relief Programs 
 
 As part of our collections strategy, we may offer temporary and short term programs in order to improve the likelihood of collections and meet the needs of our customers. Our modifications, for customers who have requested assistance and meet certain qualifying requirements, come in the form of reduced payment requirements, interest rate reductions and late fee waivers. We do not offer programs involving the forgiveness of principal. These temporary loan modifications may assist in cases where we believe the customer will recover from the short-term hardship and resume scheduled payments. Under these consumer relief programs, those accounts receiving relief may not advance to the next delinquency cycle, including charge-off, in the same time frame that would have occurred had the relief not been granted. We evaluate our consumer relief programs to determine if they represent a more than insignificant delay in payment granted to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty, in which case they would then be considered a Loan Modification. Loans in these short term programs that are determined to be Loan Modifications, will be included as such in the disclosure below. 
 
 Credit Card Loans - Modifications for Borrowers Experiencing Financial Difficulty (Loan Modifications) 
 
 In instances where cardholders are experiencing financial difficulty, we may modify our credit card loans with the intention of minimizing losses and improving collectability, while providing cardholders with financial relief; such credit card loans are classified as Loan Modifications, exclusive of the temporary, short-term consumer relief programs described above. Loan Modifications include concessions consisting primarily of a reduced minimum payment, late fee waiver, and/or an interest rate reduction. The majority of concessions remain in place for a period no longer than months; however, for certain modifications the concessions remain in place through the payoff of the credit card loans if the cardholder complies with the terms of the program.

 Unfunded Lending Commitments 
 
 We manage potential credit risk in unfunded lending commitments by reviewing each potential customer s credit application and evaluating the applicant s financial history and ability and perceived willingness to repay. Credit card loans are made primarily on an unsecured basis, and our Cardholders reside throughout the U.S. and are not significantly concentrated in any one geographic area. 
 
 We manage our potential risk in credit commitments by limiting the total amount of credit, both by individual customer and across our credit card loan portfolio, by monitoring the size and maturity of our loan portfolio and applying consistent risk-based underwriting standards reflective of current and anticipated macroeconomic conditions. We have the unilateral ability to cancel or reduce unused credit card lines at any time. Unused credit card lines available to cardholders totaled approximately billion and billion as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. While this amount represented the total available unused credit card lines, we have not experienced and do not anticipate that all cardholders will access their entire available line at any given point in time. 
 
 Portfolio Sales 
 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there were credit card loans held for sale. 
 
 In late April 2024 we sold a credit card loan portfolio for cash consideration of million. We recognized a gain on sale in April 2024 that was adjusted during the three months ended September 30, 2024 to recognize an incremental amount due under the purchase and sale agreement. 
 
 We previously announced the non-renewal of our contract with BJ s Wholesale Club (BJ s) and the sale of the BJ s portfolio, which closed in late February 2023, for a total purchase price of billion on a loan portfolio of billion, resulting in a million Gain on portfolio sale. 
 
 Portfolio Acquisition 
 
 In August 2024, we acquired a credit card loan portfolio for cash consideration of approximately million, subject to customary purchase price adjustments. 
 
 In October 2023, we acquired a credit card portfolio for cash consideration of million.

 payments allocated to future purchase activity. We use a combination of First In First Out and the Credit Card Accountability, Responsibility, and Disclosure Act of 2009 (CARD Act) methodologies to model balance paydown. 
 
 BNPL Loans 
 
 We measure our Allowance for credit losses on BNPL loans using a statistical model to estimate projected losses over the remaining terms of the loans, inclusive of an assumption for prepayments. The model is based on the historical statistical relationship between loan loss performance and certain macroeconomic data pooled based on credit quality risk score, term of the underlying loans, vintage and geographic location. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Allowance for credit losses on BNPL loans was million and million, respectively.

Net principal losses for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 include a million adjustment related to the effects of the purchase of previously written-off accounts that were sold to a third-party debt collection agency; such adjustment was made in the current period. 
 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024 the balance of the Allowance for credit losses increased, primarily due to the acquisition of the previously mentioned credit card loan portfolio. The decrease in the Allowance for credit losses during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 is the result of the decline from the seasonal peak in Credit card and other loans as of December 31, 2023, partially offset by the increased reserve rate over the period. The increase in the reserve rate from as of December 31, 2023 to as of September 30, 2024, is due primarily to lower Credit card and other loans balances, which are down from their seasonal peak at the beginning of 2024. Overall, we continue to maintain an elevated reserve rate, as of September 30, 2024, reflecting a conservative weighting of economic scenarios in our credit reserve modeling, which we intend to maintain until we see sustained improvement in delinquencies and an improved macroeconomic outlook.

Under the Indentures of each Trust and its Indenture Supplements, we are required to maintain minimum interests in our Trusts ranging from a minimum of up to a maximum of of the securitized credit card loans. This requirement is met through a transferor s interest and is supplemented through excess funding deposits which represent cash amounts deposited with the trustee of the securitizations. Cash collateral, restricted deposits are generally released proportionately as investors are repaid. Under the terms of the Trusts, the occurrence of certain triggering events associated with the performance of the securitized credit card loans in each Trust could result in certain required actions, including payment of Trust expenses, the establishment of reserve funds, or early amortization of the debt securities and/or notes, in a worst-case scenario. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, no such triggering events occurred.

 Long-term and Other Debt 
 
 Credit Agreement 
 
 In June 2023, we entered into our credit agreement with Parent Company, as borrower, certain of our domestic subsidiaries, as guarantors, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent and lender, and various other financial institutions, as lenders, which provides for a million senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the Revolving Credit Facility). As of September 30, 2024, all million remained available for future borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility. 
 
 On October 18, 2024, we amended our Revolving Credit Facility to extend the maturity date from June 13, 2026 to October 18, 2028, as well as to delete the provisions relating to our prior term loan facility (which was repaid in full and terminated in December 2023) and make certain other amendments. 
 
 Convertible Senior Notes Due 2028 
 
 In June 2023, we issued and sold million aggregate principal amount of Convertible Senior Notes due 2028 (the Convertible Notes). The Convertible Notes bear interest at an annual rate of , payable semi-annually in arrears on June 15 and December 15 of each year. The Convertible Notes mature on June 15, 2028, unless earlier repurchased, redeemed or converted. In connection with the issuance of the Convertible Notes, we entered into privately negotiated

 NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) 

 million aggregate principal amount of our outstanding Convertible Notes for a final aggregate cash repurchase price of million, which was funded with cash on hand. The final aggregate cash repurchase price, or settlement value, was subject to adjustment as a portion of the repurchase price for select repurchases was based in part on the daily volume-weighted average price per share of Parent Company s common stock over an agreed measurement period beginning in August 2024 and ending in September 2024. In connection with these aggregate repurchases, we recognized an million inducement expense in Other non-interest expenses representing the total settlement value, inclusive of transaction fees, in excess of the total conversion value (calculated in accordance with the indenture governing the Convertible Notes), as well as a million reduction in Additional paid-in capital (APIC) related to the total conversion value paid in excess of the carrying value of the Convertible Notes repurchased and a deferred tax impact. 
 
 In September 2024 we entered into two additional separate, privately negotiated repurchase agreements with holders of our Convertible Notes who approached us to repurchase million aggregate principal amount of our outstanding Convertible Notes for a final aggregate cash repurchase price of million, which was funded with cash on hand. The final aggregate cash repurchase price, or settlement value, was subject to adjustment as a portion of the repurchase price was based in part on the daily volume-weighted average price per share of Parent Company s common stock over an agreed measurement period during September 2024. In connection with these aggregate repurchases, we recognized a million inducement expense in Other non-interest expenses representing the total settlement value, inclusive of transaction fees, in excess of the total conversion value (calculated in accordance with the indenture governing the Convertible Notes), as well as a million reduction in APIC related to the total conversion value paid in excess of the carrying value of the Convertible Notes repurchased and a deferred tax impact. 
 
 In summary, in total through August and September 2024, we recognized a million inducement expense in Other non-interest expenses representing the settlement value, inclusive of transaction fees, in excess of the conversion value, and a million reduction in APIC representing the excess of the conversion value over the carrying value of the Convertible Notes repurchased and a deferred tax impact. 
 
 Prior to the repurchases of the Convertible Notes in August and September 2024, the embedded conversion feature within the Convertible Notes was both, considered indexed to the Company s own equity, and met the equity classification conditions; therefore it did not require accounting as a derivative under GAAP. Upon entering into the repurchase agreements that themselves required cash settlement of our conversion obligation in excess of the aggregate principal amount of the Convertible Notes, the embedded conversion feature for those particular Convertible Notes no longer met the equity classification conditions; therefore requiring bifurcation and accounting as a derivative. Of the total million recognized in Other non-interest expenses, million represented the mark-to-market on the embedded conversion features over the measurement period from the date the repurchase agreements were executed until settlement thereof. These fair value adjustments were determined using the daily volume-weighted average price per share of Parent Company s common stock over the measurement period. As all of the repurchases were negotiated and settled during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, there were no embedded conversion features requiring bifurcation and accounting as a derivative as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 Following the settlement of these repurchases, million of Convertible Notes remained outstanding as of September 30, 2024. For these Convertible Notes, the embedded conversion feature is both, considered indexed to the Company s own equity, and meets the equity classification conditions; therefore not requiring accounting as a derivative. We may, from time to time, seek to retire or repurchase our remaining outstanding Convertible Notes through cash purchases or exchanges for other securities, in open market purchases, tender offers, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. 
 
 Beginning on October 1, 2024, the Convertible Notes became convertible at the option of the holders during the quarterly period ending December 31, 2024, due to the last reported sales price per share of Parent Company s common stock having 
 47

 of the conversion price for each of at least trading days, whether or not consecutive, during the consecutive trading days ending on, and including, the last trading day of the immediately preceding quarter i.e., the quarter ended September 30, 2024 (the Common Stock Sale Price Condition). The Common Stock Sale Price Condition is remeasured each quarter, so the Convertible Notes may continue or cease to be convertible in future quarters depending on the performance of our stock price. Upon any such conversion, we will pay cash up to the aggregate principal amount of the Convertible Notes to be converted and pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, shares of our common stock, or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock (at our election), in respect of the remainder, if any, of our conversion obligation in excess of the aggregate principal amount of the Convertible Notes being converted. As of the date of this report, we have not received any conversion requests. 
 
 All of the Capped Call transactions continue to remain outstanding, notwithstanding the repurchases noted above. Although we do not trade or speculate in derivatives, the Capped Call transactions are expected to remain outstanding, possibly until maturity, with the objective of optimizing the economic value we receive under these transactions, in line with our strategic objectives designed to potentially offset certain of the economic impacts of the Convertible Notes. 
 
 Senior Notes due 2029 
 
 In January 2024, we issued and sold an additional million aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes due 2029 (Senior Notes due 2029) at an issue price of of principal plus accrued interest from December 22, 2023. The Senior Notes due 2029 issued in January 2024 were issued as additional notes under the same indenture pursuant to which the initial million of Senior Notes due 2029 were issued on December 22, 2023. The Senior Notes due 2029 that were issued in both December 2023 and January 2024 constitute a single series of notes and have the same terms, other than the issue date and issue price. We used the proceeds of the January 2024 offering of Senior Notes due 2029, together with million of cash on hand, to fund the redemption of million in aggregate principal amount of our outstanding Senior Notes due 2026. 
 
 Debt Issued by Consolidated VIEs 
 
 An asset-backed security is a security whose value and income payments are derived from and collateralized by a specified pool of underlying assets in our case, our credit card loans. The sale of the pool of underlying assets to general investors is accomplished through a securitization process. We regularly sell our credit card loans to our Trusts, which are consolidated. The liabilities of these consolidated VIEs include asset-backed securities for which creditors, or beneficial interest holders, do not have recourse to our general credit. 
 
 Conduit Facilities 
 
 We maintained committed syndicated bank Conduit Facilities to support the funding of our credit card loans for our Trusts. Borrowings outstanding under each private Conduit Facility bear interest at a margin above SOFR, or the asset-backed commercial paper costs of each individual conduit provider.

 Valuation Techniques Used in the Fair Value Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities 
 
 Credit card and other loans, net: Our Credit card and other loans are recorded at amortized cost, less the Allowance for credit losses, on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. In estimating the fair values, we use a discounted cash flow model (i.e., Level 3 inputs), primarily because a comparable whole loan sales market for similar loans does not exist, and therefore there is a lack of observable pricing inputs. We use various internally derived inputs, including projected income, discount rates and forecasted write-offs. Economic value attributable to future loans generated by the cardholder accounts is not included in the fair values. 
 
 Investment securities: Investment securities consist of AFS debt securities, including both mortgage-backed securities and municipal bonds, as well as equity securities, which are mutual funds, and are recorded at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Quoted prices of identical or similar investment securities in active markets are used to estimate the fair values (i.e., Level 1 or Level 2 inputs). 
 
 Deposits: Money market and other non-maturity deposits carrying values approximate their fair values because they are short-term in duration and have no defined maturity. GAAP requires that the fair values of deposit liabilities with no stated maturities equal their carrying values and does not permit recognition of the inherent funding value of the instruments. Certificates of deposit are recorded at their historical issuance cost on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, adjusted for unamortized fees, with the fair value being estimated based on the currently observable market rates available to us for similar deposits with similar remaining maturities (i.e., Level 2 inputs). Interest payable is included within Other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
 
 Debt issued by consolidated VIEs: We record debt issued by our consolidated VIEs at amortized cost (including unamortized fees, issuance costs, premiums and discounts, where applicable) on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Interest payable is included within Other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Fair value is estimated based on the currently observable market rates available to us for similar debt instruments with similar remaining maturities or quoted market prices for the same transaction (i.e., Level 2 inputs). 
 
 Long-term and other debt: We record long-term and other debt at amortized cost (including unamortized fees, issuance costs, premiums and discounts, where applicable) on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Interest payable is included within Other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The fair value is estimated based on the currently observable market rates available to us for similar debt instruments with similar remaining maturities, or quoted market prices for the same transaction (i.e., Level 2 inputs).

 Certain assets and liabilities are recognized or disclosed at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, including equity method investments, property and equipment, right-of-use assets, deferred contract costs, goodwill and intangible assets. These assets are not measured at fair value on a recurring basis but are subject to fair value adjustments in certain circumstances, such as upon impairment.

 On November 20, 2023, following the consent of the Board of Managers of Comenity Servicing LLC (the Servicer), the FDIC issued a consent order to the Servicer. The Servicer is not one of our Bank subsidiaries, but is our wholly-owned subsidiary that services substantially all of our loans. The consent order arose out of the June 2022 transition of our credit card processing services to strategic outsourcing partners and addresses certain shortcomings in the Servicer s information technology (IT) systems development, project management, business continuity management, cloud operations, and third-party oversight. The Servicer entered into the consent order for the purpose of resolving these matters without admitting or denying any violations of law or regulation set forth in the order. The consent order does not contain any monetary penalties or fines. 
 
 The Servicer continues to take significant steps to strengthen the organization s IT governance and address the other issues identified in the consent order, working diligently to ensure that all of the requirements of the consent order are satisfied.

 million in shares of our outstanding common stock in the open market during the period ending on December 31, 2024. The rationale for this repurchase program, and the amount thereof, was to offset the impact of dilution associated with issuances of employee restricted stock units, with the objective of reducing the Company s weighted average diluted share count to approximately million shares for 2024, subject to then current estimates and assumptions applicable as of the date of approval. 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, under the authorized stock repurchase program, we acquired a total of million shares of our common stock for million. Following their repurchase, these million shares ceased to be outstanding shares of common stock and are now treated as authorized but unissued shares of common stock. As of September 30, 2024, we had million remaining for future repurchases under the authorized stock repurchase program. 
 
 Stock Compensation Expense 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we awarded service-based restricted stock units (RSUs) with a weighted average grant date fair market value per share of as determined on the date of grant. Service-based restricted stock units typically vest ratably over provided that the participant is employed by us on each such vesting date. 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we awarded performance-based restricted stock units with a fair market value of to our Named Executive Officers. Performance-based RSUs cliff vest at the end of , if specific performance measures tied to our financial performance are met, which are measured annually over the period. For the performance-based RSUs awarded in 2024, the predefined vesting criteria typically permit a range from to to be earned. Accruals of compensation cost for an award with a performance condition are based on the probable outcome of that performance condition. If the performance targets are met, the awards will vest with respect to the entire award on February 15, 2027, provided that the participant is employed by us on the vesting date. 
 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recognized million and million in stock-based compensation expense, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recognized million and million in stock-based compensation expense, respectively.

 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we paid million and million in dividends to holders of our common stock. O n October 24, 2024 , our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of per share on our common stock, payable on December 13, 2024, to stockholders of record at the close of business on November 8, 2024.

 and for the nine month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

 (3) Holders of the Convertible Notes may convert their notes under certain conditions until March 15, 2028, and on or after such date without condition. Upon any such conversion, we will repay the aggregate principal amount of the Convertible Notes in cash, and pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, shares of our common stock or a combination of both (at our election), in respect of the remainder, if any, of our conversion obligation in excess of the aggregate principal amount of the Convertible Notes. At our option, we may redeem for cash, all or a portion of the Convertible Notes on or after June 21, 2026, and before the st scheduled trading day before the maturity date, but only if the closing price of our common stock reaches specified targets as defined in the indenture governing the Convertible Notes. We may also, from time to time, retire or purchase all or a portion of the outstanding Convertible Notes through cash purchases or exchanges for other securities, in open market purchases, tender offers, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. The conversion feature of the Convertible Notes has a dilutive impact on EPS when the average market price of our common stock for the period exceeds the conversion price of per share. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 the average market price exceeded the conversion price and the dilutive effect is therefore included in the table above. With the three months ended June 30, 2024 being the first period in which the average market price of our common stock exceeded the conversion price, a weighted average of the quarterly results from the Dilutive effect of Convertible Notes is computed, and has been reflected in the table above for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 (4) In connection with the issuance of the Convertible Notes, we entered into privately negotiated Capped Calls with certain financial institution counterparties. These transactions are expected generally to reduce potential dilution to our common stock upon any conversion of Convertible Notes and/or offset certain cash payments we may be required to make in excess of the principal amount of the Convertible Notes upon conversion, redemption or repurchase thereof, with such reduction and/or offset subject to a cap of per share. Diluted weighted average common stock does not include the impact of the Capped Calls we entered into concurrently with the issuance of the Convertible Notes, as the effect would have been anti-dilutive. If shares were delivered to us under the Capped Calls, those shares would offset, up to the cap, the dilutive effect of the shares that we would issue upon conversion of the Convertible Notes.

 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 
 Market Risk 
 
 Market risk is the risk to earnings or asset and liability values resulting from movements in market prices. Our principal market risk exposure arises from volatility in interest rates and changes in the relationship between the interest rates on our assets (such as Credit card and other loans and Investments) and the interest rates on our liabilities (such as Deposits, Debt issued by consolidated variable interest entities and Long-term and other debt), which may include repricing risk, basis risk, yield curve risk and options risk, and their consequential impact on economic value, capitalization levels, cost of capital and earnings. 
 
 There has been no material change from our 2023 Form 10-K related to our exposure to interest rate risk or other market risks. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 
 Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act)) as of the end of the period covered by this Report. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of the end of such period, our disclosure controls and procedures are effective and designed to ensure that the information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the requisite time periods specified in the applicable rules and forms, and that it is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 
 There have not been any changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the fiscal quarter to which this report relates that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
