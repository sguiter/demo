Act, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 or the Exchange Act. These forward-looking statements
are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results or anticipated
results. 

In
some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terms such as may, intend, might, 
 will, should, could, would, expect, believe, anticipate, 
 estimate, predict, potential, or the negative of these terms. These terms and similar expressions
are intended to identify forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements in this report are based upon management s
current expectations and beliefs, which management believes are reasonable. In addition, we cannot assess the impact of each factor on
our business or the extent to which any factor or combination of factors, or factors we are unaware of, may cause actual results to differ
materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking
statements. These statements represent our estimates and assumptions only as of the date of this report. Except to the extent required
by federal securities laws, we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after
the date hereof or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. 

You
should be aware that our actual results could differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements due to a number
of factors, including: 

our
 future financial performance, including our revenue, costs of revenue, operating expenses
 and profitability; 

the
 sufficiency of our cash and cash equivalents to meet our liquidity needs; 

our
 predictions about the proprietary development, digital transformation technology and bio
 health businesses and their respective market trends; 

our
 ability to attract and retain customers in all our business segments to purchase our products
 and services; 

the
 availability of financing for smaller publicly traded companies like us; 

our
 ability to successfully expand in our three principal business markets and into new markets
 and industry verticals; and 

our
 ability to effectively manage our growth and future expenses. 

Other
risks and uncertainties include such factors, among others, as market acceptance and market demand for our products and services, pricing,
the changing regulatory environment, the effect of our accounting policies, industry trends, adequacy of our financial resources to execute
our business plan, our ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel, and other risks described from time to time in periodic
and current reports we file with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC. You should consider
carefully the statements under this report, which address additional factors that could cause our actual results to differ from those
set forth in the forward-looking statements and could materially and adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.
All subsequent written and oral forward-looking statements attributable to us or persons acting on our behalf are expressly qualified
in their entirety by the applicable cautionary statements.

million from an underwritten secondary public offering of common stock and warrants. As of September 30, 2024, the Company has a
cash balance of approximately 
million. In October 2024, we received net proceeds of approximately 
million from a registered direct offering of common stock and pre-funded warrants, and concurrent private placement of common stock
warrants. In the absence of significant revenues in 2024 and 2025, the Company believes that its capital resources are sufficient to
fund planned operations into the fourth quarter of 2025. 

Accordingly,
we will require additional capital to continue to execute our strategy. We anticipate raising this additional capital through various
avenues including sales of equity securities, debt transactions, licensing agreements and collaborative arrangements. Although management
believes that such funding sources will be available, there can be no assurance that any such arrangements will be consummated to provide
sufficient capital when needed to allow us to continue our operations, or if available, on terms acceptable to us. If we do not raise
sufficient funds in a timely manner, among other things, we may be forced to delay, scale back or eliminate some or all our research
and product development programs and/or our capital expenditures or to enter into arrangements on unfavorable terms. We currently do
not have commitments for future funding from any source. 

The
accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates
continuity of operations, realization of assets, and satisfaction of liabilities in the ordinary course of business. Accordingly, our
consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

breach, the Company shall have 60 days to cure the material breach. In July 2022, the Company entered into an exclusive, world-wide,
royalty-bearing license from JHU-APL for the additional technology developed to enhance the bfLEAP platform. The new license provides
additional intellectual property rights including patents, copyrights, and knowhow to be utilized under the Company s bfLEAP 
analytical AI/ML platform. This license supersedes the previous license. In consideration of the new license, the Company issued 
shares of common stock to JHU. Under the terms of the new License Agreement, JHU will be entitled to eight percent of net sales
for the services provided by the Company to other parties and three percent for internally developed drug projects in which the
JHU license was utilized. The new license also contains tiered sub licensing fees that start at and reduce to based on revenues.
In addition, under the new license agreement, the minimum annual royalty payments are for 2022, for 2023, and 
per year for 2024 and beyond. 

In
May 2023, the Company and JHU-APL entered into Amendment number 1 of the July 2022 License Agreement whereby the Company gained access
to certain improvements including additional patents and knowhow in exchange for a series of payments totaling . The first of
these payments for was paid in July 2023 and the remaining payments of , , and are due in years 2025, 2026,
and 2027, respectively. The amendment also reduced the 2023 minimum annual royalty payment to , all other financial terms remain
the same. As of September 30, 2024, we have accrued of the 2024 minimum annual royalty payments. 

George
Washington University - Beta2-spectrin siRNA License 

In
January 2022, the Company entered into an exclusive, world-wide, royalty-bearing license from George Washington University (GWU) for
rights to use siRNA targeting Beta2-spectrin in the treatment of human diseases, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The license
covers methods claimed in three US and worldwide patent applications, and also includes use of this approach for treatment of obesity,
non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. 

In
consideration of the rights granted to the Company under the License Agreement, the Company paid GWU a License Initiation Fee.
Under the terms of the License Agreement, GWU will be entitled to a three percent royalty on net sales subject to quarterly minimums
once the first sale has occurred subsequent to regulatory approval, as well sublicense or assignment fees in the event the Company sublicenses
or assigns their rights to use the technology. The Company will also reimburse GWU for previously incurred and ongoing patent costs.
The Sublicense and Assignment fee amounts decline as the Company advances the clinical development of the licensed technology. The license
agreement also contains milestone payments for clinical development through the approval of an NDA and commercialization. As of September
30, 2024, there has been no accrual for royalties since we have not begun to generate applicable revenue. The Company assessed whether
the license should be capitalized and determined that the licensed program is in the early stage and therefore may not be recoverable;
the Company expensed the license fee and will expense development costs until commercial viability is likely. 

Johns
Hopkins University Mebendazole License 

In
February 2022, the Company entered into an exclusive, world-wide, royalty-bearing license from Johns Hopkins University (JHU) for the
use of an improved formulation of Mebendazole for the treatment of any human cancer or neoplastic disease. This formulation shows potent
activity in animal models with different types of cancer and has been evaluated in a Phase I clinical trial in patients with high-grade
glioma (NCT01729260). The trial, an open-label dose-escalation study, assessed the safety and efficacy of the improved formulation with
adjuvant temozolomide in 24 patients with newly diagnosed gliomas. Investigators observed no dose-limiting toxicity in patients receiving
all but the highest tested dose (200mg/kg/day). Four of the 15 patients receiving the maximum tested dose of 200mg/kg/day experienced
dose-limiting toxicity, all of which were reversed by decreasing or eliminating the dose given. There were no serious adverse events
attributed to Mebendazole at any dose during the trial. 41.7 of patients who received Mebendazole were alive at two years after enrollment,
and 25 were alive at four years (Gallia et al., 2021). 

The
license covers six (6) issued patents and one (1) pending application. In consideration of the rights granted to the Company under the
License Agreement, JHU will receive a staggered Upfront License Fee of . The Company initially paid and the remaining
balance of was paid after the Company completed its IPO. The Company will also reimburse JHU for previously incurred and ongoing
patent costs. Under the terms of the License Agreement, JHU will be entitled to three and one-half percent royalty on net sales
by the Company in which the JHU license was utilized. In addition, the Company is required to pay JHU minimum annual royalty payments
of for 2022, for 2023, for 2024, for 2025, and for 2026 and each year after until the first commercial
sale, after which, the annual minimum royalty shall be . The license agreement also contains milestone payments for clinical
development steps through the approval of an NDA and commercialization. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the balance of
accrued expense related to this license agreement was and , respectively. The Company assessed whether the license should
be capitalized and determined that the licensed program is in the early stage and therefore may not be recoverable; the Company expensed
the license fee and will expense development costs until commercial viability is likely. 

Johns
Hopkins University Prodrug License 

In
October 2022, the Company entered into an exclusive, world-wide, royalty-bearing license from JHU and the Institute of Organic Chemistry
and Biochemistry (IOCB) of the Czech Academy of Sciences for rights to commercialize N-substituted prodrugs of Mebendazole that demonstrate
improved solubility and bioavailability. The license covers prodrug compositions and use for treating disease as claimed in multiple

Overview 

Bullfrog
AI Holdings, Inc. was incorporated in the State of Nevada in February 2020. Bullfrog AI Holdings, Inc. is the parent company of Bullfrog
AI, Inc. and Bullfrog AI Management, LLC, which were incorporated in Delaware and Maryland, in 2017 and 2021, respectively. Operations
are currently conducted through Bullfrog AI Holdings, Inc., which began operations on February 6, 2020. We are a company focused specifically
on advanced Artificial Intelligence / Machine Learning (AI/ML) analysis of complex data in the advancement of medicine. Our founding
AI/ML platform (trade name: bfLEAP was created from technology originally developed at The Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics
Laboratory (JHU-APL). Subsequently, we have developed new tools and capabilities composed of an ensemble of machine learning and artificial
intelligence models. 

In
February 2018, Bullfrog AI Holdings secured the original exclusive, worldwide, royalty-bearing license from JHU-APL. The license covers
three (3) issued patents, one (1) new provisional patent application, non-patent rights to proprietary libraries of algorithms and other
trade secrets including modifications and improvements. Our objective is to utilize our AI/ML platform with a precision medicine approach
toward drug development with biopharmaceutical collaborators, as well as for our own internal clinical development programs. We believe
the bfLEAP platform is ideally suited for evaluating pre-clinical and clinical trial data generated in translational research
and clinical trial settings that lead to faster, less expensive drug approvals. 

15 

Our
aim is to improve the odds of success in each stage of developing medicine, ranging from early pre-clinical through late-stage clinical
development. Our ultimate objective is to utilize bfLEAP to enable the success of ongoing clinical trials or rescue late-stage
failed drugs (i.e., Phase 2 or Phase 3 clinical trial failures) for in-house development and divestiture; although, we also consider
entering collaborations for earlier stage drugs. 

In
September 2020 and October 2021, the Company executed amendments to the original February 2018 license which represents improvements
and new advanced analytics capabilities. In consideration of the rights granted to the Company under the original License Agreement,
the Company granted JHU 178,571 warrants exercisable to purchase shares of common stock at 2.10 per share. 

In
July 2022, the Company entered into an exclusive, worldwide, royalty-bearing license from JHU-APL that provides additional intellectual
property rights including patents, copyrights, and knowhow to be utilized under the Company s bfLEAP analytical AI/ML platform.
In consideration for the new license, the Company issued to JHU-APL 39,879 shares of common stock. Under the terms of the new License
Agreement, JHU will be entitled to eight (8 percent of net sales for the services provided by the Company to other parties and three
(3 percent for internally developed drug projects in which the JHU license was utilized. The new license also contains tiered sub licensing
fees that start at fifty (50 percent and reduce to twenty-five (25 percent based on revenues. The Company and JHU-APL entered into
Amendment number 1 of the July 2022 License Agreement whereby the Company gained access to certain improvements including additional
patents and knowhow in exchange for a series of payments totaling 275,000. The first of these payments for 75,000 was paid in July
2023 and the remaining payments of 75,000, 75,000 and 50,000 are due in years 2025, 2026 and 2027, respectively. The amendment also
reduced the 2023 minimum annual royalty payment to 60,000, all other financial terms remain the same. As a result of this Amendment,
the minimum annual payments were 30,000 for 2022 and 60,000 for 2023, and the minimum annual payments will be 300,000 for 2024 and
beyond, all of which are creditable by royalties. As of September 30, 2024, we have accrued 225,000 of the 2024 minimum annual royalty
payments. 

We
intend to continue to evolve and improve bfLEAP , either in-house or with development partners like JHU-APL. We plan to leverage
our proprietary AI/ML platform, developed over several years at one of the top innovation institutions in the world which has already
been successfully applied in multiple sectors. 

We
have staffed our business using funds from our initial public offering and have entered into partnerships and relationships and recently
completed our first commercial service contract with a leading rare disease non-profit organization for AI/ML analysis of late-stage
clinical data. We have also acquired the rights to a series of preclinical and early clinical drug assets from universities, as well
as a strategic collaboration with a world-renowned research institution to create a HSV1 viral therapeutic platform to engineer immunotherapies
for a variety of diseases. We have signed exclusive worldwide License Agreements with JHU for a cancer drug that targets glioblastoma
(brain cancer), pancreatic cancer, and others. We have also signed an exclusive worldwide license from George Washington University for
another cancer drug that targets hepatocellular carcinoma (liver cancer) and other liver diseases. In addition, we have signed three-year
strategic data and commercialization agreements with the Lieber Institute for Brain Development LIBD whom we believe
has a repository of the largest collection of postmortem brains in the world including molecular, clinical, and other data. The objective
of this partnership is for the Company to analyze these rich data sets using its proprietary AI/ML tools and models and then go to market
with the discoveries with the ultimate goal of securing revenue generating strategic partnership deals with biopharmaceutical companies.
We intend to secure the rights to other proprietary data sets and repeat this strategy. Additionally, we intend to gain access to later-stage
clinical assets through partnerships or the acquisition of rights to failed therapeutic candidates for drug rescue. In certain circumstances,
we intend to conduct late-stage clinical trials in an effort to rescue therapeutic assets that previously failed. In these cases, there
will be a requirement for drug supply and regulatory services to conduct clinical trials. The success of our clinical development programs
will require finding partners to support the clinical development, adequate availability of raw materials and/or drug product for our
R D and clinical trials, and, in some cases, may also require establishment of third-party arrangements to obtain finished drug product
that is manufactured appropriately under Good Manufacturing Practices, and packaged for clinical use or sale. Since we are a company
focused on using our AI technology to advance medicines, any clinical development programs will also require, in all cases, partners
and the establishment of third-party relationships for execution and completion of clinical trials. 

16 

Since
completing our IPO in February 2023, aided by the receipt of the IPO proceeds in addition to the proceeds from our February 2024 and
October 2024 offerings, we have implemented several initiatives: investor relations and marketing to promote and raise awareness of the
company in the financial and business sectors, research and development, collaboration with the J Craig Venter Institute and initiated
preclinical studies with our in-licensed drug programs. The Company is actively engaged in developing and pursuing new intellectual property
as it strives to continuously evolve its AI/ML platform. 

Internally,
the Company has added incremental staff to accelerate execution, and the development of processes and custom scripts for use in performing
new drug target discovery and analytical services for customers, while also launching initiatives targeting large public health data
sources and seeking access to proprietary health data sources, such as our agreement with the Lieber Institute for Brain Development.
We also transitioned our accounting and financial reporting systems and processes to enhance our internal control environment as a public
company. Capital from the IPO was also used to retire two notes that were sold to fund the Company through the IPO that did not convert
into common stock as well as other debts accrued over time to our staff, employees and consultants as well as obligations related to
the acquisition of our licensed drug programs. 

The
Company has had negative cash flows from operations and operated at a net loss since inception. In the first quarter of 2023, we
completed our initial public offering IPO ). In February 2024, we received net proceeds of approximately 5.7 million
from an underwritten secondary public offering of common stock and warrants. As of September 30, 2024, the Company has a cash
balance of approximately 4.2 million. In October 2024, we received net proceeds of approximately 2.7 million from a registered
direct offering of common stock and pre-funded warrants, and concurrent private placement of common stock warrants. In the absence
of significant revenues in 2024 and 2025, the Company believes that its capital resources are sufficient to fund planned operations
into the fourth quarter of 2025. 

Accordingly,
we will require additional capital to continue to execute our strategy. We anticipate raising this additional capital through various
avenues including sales of equity securities, debt transactions, licensing agreements and collaborative arrangements. Although management
believes that such funding sources will be available, there can be no assurance that any such arrangements will be consummated to provide
sufficient capital when needed to allow us to continue our operations, or if available, on terms acceptable to us. If we do not raise
sufficient funds in a timely manner, among other things, we may be forced to delay, scale back or eliminate some or all our research
and product development programs and/or our capital expenditures or to enter into arrangements on unfavorable terms. We currently do
not have commitments for future funding from any source. 

Our
Strategy 

The
Company has a unique strategy designed to reduce risk and increase the frequency of cash flow. The first part of the strategy is to generate
revenues through strategic relationships with biopharma companies. These relationships will be structured as a combination of fees and
intellectual property based on the specific scope of the engagement. The objective of these engagements will be to uncover valuable insights
to reduce the risk and/or increase the speed of the drug development process which can be achieved through manual or automated integration
into the client s workflow or analysis of discrete data sets. 

In
the future, the second part of our strategy involves acquiring the rights to drugs at various stages of development, using our proprietary
AI/ML technology to advance the development and make discoveries, with the objective of creating near term value and then exiting and
monetizing as quickly as possible, preferably within approximately 30 months. 

Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates 

Our
financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, as well as related disclosures. We evaluate
our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions that
we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Our actual results could differ from these estimates. There have been no material
changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates as those described in our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31,
2023.

Financial
Operations Overview 

Revenue 

While
we generated our first revenues in late 2022 from our services provided to a pharmaceutical customer, we completed our first commercial
service contract and recognized revenue in the amount of 65,000 in the third quarter of 2023. We did not generate any revenue during
the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

Research
and Development Costs and Expenses 

Research
and development expenses consist primarily of costs related to the acquisition of licensed technology, annual minimum royalty fees payable
until commercialization, fees paid to external service providers and internal costs for personnel working on research and development
activities, including work on our proprietary platform which utilizes bfLEAP and an ensemble of AI/ML tools and models. 

Research
and development costs are expensed as incurred. Estimates are used in determining the expense liability of certain costs where services
have been performed but not yet invoiced. 

We
anticipate our research and development costs continuing to increase as we execute on our business plan and begin conducting preclinical
research and development activities directed at securing development partners and filing an Investigational New Drug application for
our licensed drug development programs described in this filing, as well as under strategic partnerships and for other drug development
programs we may pursue. Further, we anticipate our research and development costs will increase as we add additional staff and perform
analytical work aimed at target discovery on proprietary data sets through our partnering efforts as well as with prospective customers. 

General
and Administrative Expenses 

General
and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel related costs, including non-cash stock-based compensation, as well as accounting
and consulting services, insurance expense, and legal fees relating to corporate matters. We anticipate that our general and administrative
expenses will increase in the future to support our target discovery efforts, service offerings, and clinical and pre-clinical research
and development activities associated with strategic partnering and collaborations.

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

In
2022, the Company received net proceeds from the sale of Convertible Bridge Notes of approximately 1,016,000 and repaid unsecured promissory
notes sold in 2021 in the amount of 49,000. The Company sold one additional promissory note and received net proceeds of 100,000 in
January 2023. 

Through
September 30, 2024, the Company has an accumulated deficit of approximately 15.1 million and has funded its operations through the sale
of common stock and debt. We anticipate that our expenses will increase in the future to support our target discovery activities, service
offerings, clinical and pre-clinical research and development activities associated with strategic partnering and collaborations, as
well as acquired product candidates and the increased costs of operating as a public company. 

The
Company s current entities include Bullfrog AI, Inc. and Bullfrog Management, LLC, which are wholly owned subsidiaries of Bullfrog
AI Holdings, Inc., which is a holding company that depends upon the sale of its securities and cash generated through its subsidiaries
to fund consolidated operations.

On
February 16, 2023, the Company completed its IPO of 1,297,318 units (each, a Unit, collectively, the Units at a price of 6.50 per unit for a total of approximately 8.4 million of gross proceeds to the Company. Each Unit consists of one share
of the Company s common stock, one tradeable warrant (each, a Tradeable Warrant, collectively, the Tradeable
Warrants to purchase one share of common stock at an exercise price of 7.80 per share, and one non-tradeable warrant (each,
a Non-tradeable Warrant, collectively, the Non-tradeable Warrants together with the Tradeable Warrants,
each, a Warrant, collectively, the Warrants to purchase one share of the Company s common stock at
an exercise price of 8.125. In connection with the IPO, the Company also completed a 1-for-7 reverse stock split of our common stock. 

In
connection with the IPO, a SAFE and convertible loan agreement held by a related party converted into 55,787 shares of common stock.
Additionally, all outstanding convertible bridge notes and accrued interest through November 30, 2022 were converted into 276,289 shares
of common stock and 276,289 warrants to purchase common stock and were issued to the Convertible Bridge Note holders at conversion. The
convertible bridge note conversions and the warrant exercise pricing were determined using a 25 million company valuation immediately
before the IPO. 

In
April 2023, the holders of warrants exercised 436,533 warrants for common stock at various exercise prices and the Company received proceeds
of approximately 1,495,000. 

In
February 2024, we completed an underwritten secondary offering of common stock and warrants generating approximately 5.7 million of
net proceeds. 

In
the first quarter of 2024, holders exercised warrants (including prefunded warrants from the secondary offering) to purchase 508,814
shares of common stock generating proceeds of approximately 106,000. 

In
October 2024, we completed a registered direct offering of common stock and pre-funded warrants, and concurrent private placement of
common stock warrants generating approximately 2.7 million of net proceeds. 

In
the absence of significant revenues in 2024 and 2025, management believes the Company s capital resources are sufficient to fund
planned operations into the fourth quarter of 2025. Accordingly, we will seek additional capital to continue to execute our strategy
as discussed above.

4. Controls and Procedures 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

We
are required to maintain disclosure controls and procedures as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934. In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, our management recognized that disclosure controls
and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of
disclosure controls and procedures are met. The design of any disclosure controls and procedures also is based in part upon certain assumptions
about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under
all potential future conditions. We conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September
30, 2024. Based on this evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and
procedures were not effective as of the end of the reporting period covered in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, as a result of the
material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting described below. Notwithstanding the identified material weaknesses,
our management has concluded that the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in this quarterly filing on Form 10-Q, and
the audited consolidated financial statements contained in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, fairly present, in all
material respects, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows as of and for the periods presented in conformity with
GAAP. 

Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

Management
has identified material weaknesses in its internal controls over financial reporting at December 31, 2023. Specifically, Management noted
the Company did not properly document, implement or operate a system of effective internal controls over financial reporting. 

Ongoing
Remediation Efforts 

Management
is in the process of implementing improvements to its internal controls over financial reporting. Namely the Company has and is continuing
to: 

transitioned its day-to-day
 accounting processes to a new external firm including automating its vendor payments; 

initiated the transfer of
 the overall accounting process to an enterprise type accounting platform; 

periodically review the design
 and effectiveness of our controls including the creation of an annual risk assessment and ongoing monitoring activities; and 

evaluate all internal and
 external resources to ensure they are appropriate for the level and complexity of our current operations. This includes the recent
 hiring of a Corporate Controller. 

While
we believe that these efforts will improve our internal control over financial reporting, the implementation of these measures is ongoing
and will require validation and testing of the design and operating effectiveness of internal controls over a sustained period of financial
reporting cycles. We will continue to monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting on an ongoing
basis and are committed to taking further action and implementing additional enhancements or improvements, as necessary and as funds
allow. We cannot assure you that the measures we have taken to date, or that we may take in the future, will be sufficient to remediate
the material weaknesses we have identified or avoid potential future material weaknesses. Accordingly, there could continue to be a reasonable
possibility that a material misstatement of our financial statements would not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.
