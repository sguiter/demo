CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 

This report contains certain
statements related to future results, or states our intentions, beliefs, and expectations or predictions for the future, all of which
are forward-looking statements as that term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements
represent management s expectations or forecasts of future events. Forward-looking statements are typically identified by words
such as anticipate, believe, estimate, expect, forecast, project, 
 intend, plan, probably, potential, looking forward, continue, 
and other similar terms, and future or conditional tense verbs like could, may, might, should, 
 will, and would. You can also identify forward-looking statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly
to historical or current facts. These forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual
results to differ materially from either historical or anticipated results depending on a variety of factors. Forward-looking statements
in this Form 10-Q may include, for example, statements concerning: 

our future operating and financial performance, ability to
generate positive cash flow and ability to achieve and sustain profitability; 

our competitive position; 

the sufficiency of our existing capital resources to fund
our future operating expenses; 

the timing of the introduction of new solutions and services; 

the likelihood of success in and impact of litigation; 

our protection or enforcement of our intellectual property
rights; 

our expectation with respect to securities, options and future
markets and general economic conditions; 

our ability to keep up with rapid technological change; 

the impact of future legislation and regulatory changes on
our business; and 

our anticipated use of proceeds from our initial public offering. 

Any or all of our forward-looking
statements may turn out to be inaccurate, and there are no guarantees about our performance. The factors identified above are not exhaustive.
We operate in a dynamic business environment in which new risks may emerge frequently. Accordingly, readers should not place undue reliance
on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the dates on which they are made. We are under no (and expressly disclaim any) obligation
to update or alter any forward-looking statement that we may make from time to time, whether as a result of new information, future events,
or otherwise, except as may be required under applicable securities laws.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

You should read the following
discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements
and related notes included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report. This discussion and other parts of this report contain forward-looking
statements that involve risks and uncertainties, such as statements of our plans, objectives, expectations and intentions. Our actual
results could differ materially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements. 

Overview 

We are a U.S.-based integrated
cross-border supply chain solution provider with a strategic focus on the Asian market including China and South Korea. We primarily provide
customized cross-border ocean freight solutions and airfreight solutions in the U.S. that specifically cater to our customers 
requirements and needs in transporting goods into the U.S. We offer a wide variety of integrated services under our cross-border
ocean freight solutions and cross-border airfreight solutions, including (i) cross-border freight consolidation and forwarding services,
(ii) customs clearance services, (iii) warehousing and distribution services and (iv) U.S. domestic ground transportation
services. 

Founded in Chicago, Illinois
in 2018, we are an Asian American-owned business rooted in the U.S. with in-depth understanding of both the U.S. and Asian international
trading and logistics service markets. Our customers are typically Asia- and U.S.-based logistics service companies serving large e-commerce
platforms, social commerce platforms and manufacturers to sell and transport consumer and industrial goods made in Asia into the U.S. Since
inception and as of September 30, 2024, we had served over 300 customers to fulfill over 45,000 cross-border supply chain solution orders. 

We have established an extensive
collaboration network of service providers, including global freight carriers for our cross-border freight consolidation and forwarding
services as well as domestic ground transportation carriers for our U.S. domestic transportation services. Since inception and as
of September 30, 2024, we had collaborated with almost all major global ocean and air carriers to forward 32,800 TEU of container loads
and 55,100 tons of air cargo. As of September 30, 2024, we had also cooperated with over 200 domestic ground transportation carriers,
including almost all major U.S. domestic ground transportation carriers, on a long-term, short-term or order basis, as the case may
be. 

We operate three massive and hyper-busy regional warehousing and distribution
centers in the U.S., in Illinois and Texas. With an aggregate gross feet area of approximately 142,484 square feet and 52 docks,
our regional warehousing and distribution centers have an aggregate daily floor load of up to 3,000 cubic meters of freight. In addition
to our self-operated regional centers, we maintain close contact with over 150 warehouses and distribution terminals in almost all transportation
hubs in the U.S. which we have cooperated in the past to support the warehousing and distributing services of our cross-border freight
in case such freight requires storage, fulfilment, transloading, palletizing, packaging or distribution in states other than Illinois
and Texas. As of September 30, 2024, we had assisted with the customs clearance, in conjunction with our other service offerings, of cross-border
freight of an aggregate assessed value of over 42.6 million. 

Leveraging our strong cross-border supply chain service capabilities,
extensive service provider network of cross-border freight carriers and U.S. domestic ground transportation carriers, massive and
hyper-busy regional warehousing and distribution centers as well as deep understanding of the Asian market, we have been able to build
up our brand and reputation and have achieved fast growth since our inception. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023,
our revenues amounted to 4.1 million and 4.1 million, respectively, and our gross profit amounted to 0.5 million and 0.6
million during the same periods, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, we had fulfilled over 45,000 cross-border supply chain solution
orders for freight of an aggregate assessed value of 1.0 billion, delivered to thousands of business and residential addresses in
approximately 48 U.S. states. 

31 

Key Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations 

We believe the most significant
factors that affect our business and results of operations include the following: 

Our Ability to Expand Our Customer Base 

Our results of operations
are dependent upon our ability to expand and maintain our customer base. Since inception and as of September 30, 2024, we had served over
300 customers to fulfill over 45,000 cross-border supply chain solution orders. We will continue to expand our customer base to achieve
a sustainable business growth. We aim to attract new customers and maintain our existing customers. We plan to improve the quality and
expand the variety of our services to obtain more customers. 

Our Ability to Control Costs 

Our results of operations
are affected by our ability to control costs including transportation and delivery costs, warehouse service charges, custom declaration
and terminal charges, freight arrangement charges and other overhead cost allocation, which may be subject to factors, including, among
other things, fluctuations in wage rates, fuel prices, toll fees, and leasing costs. Effective cost-control measures have a direct impact
on our financial condition and results of operations. For example, our cross-border freight carrier and U.S. domestic ground transportation
carrier services providers use large quantities of fuel to operate vehicles, and therefore, hence the higher fuel cost incurred by them
may causes our higher fee rates cost charged on us by such the service providers. The availability and price of fuel and third-party transportation
capacity are subject to political, economic, and market factors that are beyond our control. We also incur a significant amount of costs
in relation to transportation and labor. Any unexpected increase in these costs, which is subject to factors beyond our control, could
adversely impact our profitability. We have adopted, and expect to adopt, additional cost control measures. However, the measures we have
adopted or will adopt in the future may not be as effective as expected. If we are not able to effectively control our costs and adjust
the level of fee rates based on operating costs and market conditions, our profitability and cash flow may be adversely affected. 

Our Ability to Provide High-quality Services 

Our results of operations
depend on our ability to maintain and further enhance our service quality. Together with our network of service providers, we provide
integrated cross-border ocean and air freight supply chain solutions and services to our customers. If we or our service providers are
unable to provide express delivery services in a timely, reliable, safe and secure manner, our reputation and customer loyalty could be
negatively affected. In additional, if our customer service personnel fail to satisfy customer needs or respond effectively to customer
complaints, we may lose potential or existing customers and experience a decrease in customer orders, which could have a material adverse
effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

Strategic Acquisitions and Investments 

Our results of operations
also depend on our ability to pursue strategic acquisitions and investments in expanding our global footprints, diversifying our service
offerings, and advancing our technologies. We may selectively pursue mergers, acquisitions, investments, joint ventures and partnerships
that we believe are strategic and complementary to our operations and technology. However, we cannot assure you that we will make prudent
decisions at all times. Our ability to successfully execute or effectively operate, integrate, leverage and grow these investments or
strategic partnerships could impact our results of operations and financial conditions. 

32 

Impact of COVID-19 

The global spread of COVID-19
and the efforts to control it have slowed global economic activity and disrupted, and reduced the efficiency of, normal business activities
in much of the world. The pandemic has resulted in authorities around the world implementing numerous unprecedented measures such as travel
restrictions, quarantines, shelter in place orders, and factory and office shutdowns. These measures have impacted and will likely continue
to impact our workforce and operations, and those of our customers and suppliers. 

Delays and congestions at
various ports as a result of the COVID-19 restrictions during the pandemic also prolonged the delivery times for certain of our cross-border
freight. Additionally, ocean freight carriers have consolidated with the potential for more to occur in the future. COVID-19 has placed
significant stress on our global ocean and air freight carriers, U.S. domestic ground transportation carriers as well as other service
providers, which may result in reduced carrier capacity or availability, pricing volatility or more limited carrier transportation schedules
and other services that we utilize, which could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

In response to governmental
directives and recommended safety measures, we have implemented personal safety measures at all of our facilities. However, these measures
may not be sufficient to mitigate the risk of infection by COVID-19. If a significant number of our employees, or third parties performing
key functions, including our chief executive officer and members of our board of directors, become ill, our business may be further adversely
impacted. 

The impact of COVID-19 pandemic
on us in the future will depend on future developments which are highly unpredictable and beyond our control, such as the frequency, duration
and severity of the resurgence of COVID-19 and the emergence of new variants, as well as the measures that may be taken by governments
around the world in response to these developments, the impact of the pandemic on the global economy and the measures taken by governments
to stimulate the general economy. Therefore, we cannot guarantee that the pandemic will not continue to have an adverse effect on our
business and results of operations in the future, which may be material. 

We will continue to actively
monitor the situation and may take further actions that alter our business operations as may be required by federal, state, local or foreign
authorities, or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, customers, service providers and stockholders.

Revenues 

Our total revenues decreased
by 66,922, or 1.6 , from 4,148,476 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, to 4,081,554 for the three months ended September
30, 2024. The decrease was primarily driven by a decrease in revenues from our cross-border airfreight solutions, partially offset by
an increase in revenues from our cross-border ocean freight solutions. 

Revenues from our cross-border
airfreight solutions decreased by 0.2 million or 8.2 , from 2.4 million in the three months ended September 30, 2023, to 2.2 million
in the three months ended September 30, 2024. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in the volume of cross-border air freight
processed, from approximately 7,816 tons for the three months ended September 30, 2023, to approximately 7,273 tons for the three months
ended September 30, 2024. 

Revenues from our cross-border
ocean freight solutions increased by 0.1 million, or 7.8 , from 1.7 million in the three months ended September 30, 2023, to 1.8 million
in the three months ended September 30, 2024. This growth was primarily due to an increase in the volume of cross-border ocean freights
processed and forwarded, rising from 1,290 TEU in the three months ended September 30, 2023, to 1,430 TEU in the three months ended September
30, 2024. 

We anticipate a revenue rebound
in the next quarter, driven by increased air freight demand for the upcoming holiday season as online purchases surge. In response to
rising customer demand, we have expanded our production capacity and are now equipped to handle a higher volume of purchase orders. Additionally,
the continued decline in ocean freight charges is stimulating import and export activities, while the ongoing trend toward online shopping
highlights the need for timely and competitively priced deliveries to end consumers.

Revenues from the Asia-based
customers increased by 1.1 million, or 65.8 , from 1.7 million in the three months ended September 30, 2023, to 2.8 million in the
three months ended September 30, 2024. Revenues from the U.S.-based customers decreased by 1.2 million, or 48.2 , from 2.5 million
in the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 1.3 million in the same period in 2024. 

The increase in revenues from
Asia-based customers in the three months ended September 30, 2024, was driven by a surge in volume from these customers, particularly
those serving large e-commerce platforms. This growth reflects the rising demand for our services, a direct result of the overall expansion
of the U.S. e-commerce market. 

35 

The decrease in revenue from
the U.S.-based customers in the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023, was primarily due to our strategic
shift toward Asia-based e-commerce customers. Additionally, special projects with larger shipment volumes from U.S. customers were completed
in the three months ended September 30, 2023, with no comparable projects in the same period in 2024.

Our cost of revenues increased
by 0.1 million, or 1.7 , from 3.5 million in the three months ended September 30, 2023, to 3.6 million in the three months ended September
30, 2024. The increase in cost of revenues was mainly due to the combined effects of: 

(i) 
 an increase in our warehouse service charges, mainly representing labor costs at our regional warehousing and distribution centers during the three months ended September 30, 2024, due to (a) extended service hours to process higher volumes of cross-border airfreight, and (b) the hiring of additional employees at our regional warehousing and distribution centers to support our growing business; 

(ii) 
 an increase in custom declaration and terminal charges, consisting of customs fees, handling charges, and entry service fees charged by ports and terminals during the three months ended September 30, 2024, resulting from the higher assessed value of cross-border freight, particularly airfreight, during the same period; 

(iii) 
 an increase in freight arrangement charges, mainly representing scheduling and booking fees for cross-border ocean freight during the three months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to increased business for cross boarder shipping from the U.S. to China; and 

(iv) 
 
 an increase in overhead costs, mainly comprising
 warehouse and equipment lease expenses, utilities, depreciation of property and equipment, and other direct costs during the three months
 ended September 30, 2024. The warehouse and equipment lease expenses increased significantly, from 207,807 in the three months ended
 September 30, 2023, to 410,193 in the three months ended September 30, 2024. The increase in lease expenses was primarily due to the
 addition of two warehouse agreements in the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period last year, and 

(v) 
 A decrease in transportation and delivery costs, including trucking, drayage, chassis rental, freight and delivery cost during the three months ended September 30, 2024, which was primarily due to a reduction in delivery service provided to customers. Instead, we offered a more comprehensive service package, which included warehouse and transloading services. 

Gross Profit 

Our gross profit decreased
by 0.1 million, or 19.3 , from 0.6 million in the three months ended September 30, 2023, to 0.5 million in the three months ended September
30, 2024. Our gross margin was 12.8 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 15.6 for the three months ended September
30, 2023. The decline in gross margin was primarily attributable to (i) reduced revenue from the airfreight solution, and (ii) an increase
in our cost of revenue in warehouse services, custom declaration and terminal charges, frights arrange charge and overhead costs allocated,
as discussed above. 

36 

General and Administrative Expenses 

Our general and administrative
expenses increased by 1.0 million, or 114.7 , from 0.9 million in the three months ended September 30, 2023, to 1.8 million in the
three months ended September 30, 2024. These expenses represented 45.0 and 20.6 of our total revenues for the three months ended September
30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase was primarily attributed to higher salary and employee benefit expenses, professional fee,
office expense and traveling, insurance expense and entertainment expense: 

Our salaries and employee
benefits expenses increased by 0.3 million, or 116.9 , from 0.5 million in the three months ended September 30, 2023, to 0.8 million
in the three months ended September 30, 2024. Our salaries and employee benefits expenses represented 50.3 and 66.8 of our total general
and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase was mainly due to the recruitment
of additional sales, customer services, and back-office support personnel to support our business growth. For our salaries and employee
benefits expenses, (i) our payroll expenses increased by 0.3 million, or 63.6 , from 0.5 million in the three months ended September
30, 2023, to 0.8 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024, and (ii) our employee benefit expenses, which mainly consist of
401(k) company contribution, meal allowance and health insurance expenses, increased by 0.01 million, or 53.3 , from 0.1 million in
the three months ended September 30, 2023, to 0.2 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024, representing 8.9 and 12.5 of
our total general and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase was mainly
due to rising employee health insurance premiums. 

Our professional fee increased
by 0.3 million, or 1,839.6 , from 17,535 in the three months ended September 30, 2023, to 340,114 in the three months ended September
30, 2024. Our professional fee represented 18.5 and 2.0 of our total general and administrative expenses for the three months ended
September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase was primarily due to audit fee, legal fee, consulting expense, investor-related
expenses and financial reporting service fees for the three months ended September 30, 2024. In the three months ended September 30, 2023,
most of the expenses directly related to offering that were not included in professional fees, as they were accounted for as deferred
initial public offering assets. 

Our office expense represented
9.0 and 8.2 of our total general and administrative expenses for three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase
was mainly due to office hardware including monitors and keyboard, printer ink, printer kits and charger purchased and more office supplies
consumed due to more staff hired. 

Our insurance expense
increased by 68,937, or 1,452.6 , from 4,746 in the three months ended September 30, 2023, to 73,683 in the three months ended
September 30, 2024. The increase was primarily due to purchasing insurance premiums for our directors and officers, as we became a
public company in July 2024. 

Our traveling and entertainment
expense represented 6.9 and 8.4 of our total general and administrative expenses for three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023,
respectively. The increase was mainly due to higher entertainment and gift expenses related to networking with our business partners. 

Other Income, Net 

Our other income, net, increased
by 62,839, or 133.8 , from 46,949 in the three months ended September 30, 2023, to 109,788 in the three months ended September 30,
2024. The increase was primarily due to renting out part of our office space to our related party, Weship, for an additional two months
during the three months ended September 30, 2024. 

Interest Expenses 

Our interest expenses for
the three months ended September 30, 2024, remained relatively stable compared to same period in last year. 

37 

Loss Before Income Taxes 

We had loss before income
taxes of 1.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to loss before income taxes of 0.3 million for the three
months ended September 30, 2023. We were in a loss position before income taxes for the three months ended September 30, 2024, primarily
attributable to the net effects of: (i) the decrease in gross profit, (ii) the rise in operating expenses; and (iii) the
increase in other income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as mentioned above. 

Income Tax Expense 

We had income tax expense
of 89,581 and income tax recovery of 2,059 in the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. We did not have current
income tax provision in the three months ended September 30, 2024, due to net operating loss, and we recognized a deferred income tax
asset of 373,897 due to temporary differences recognized and net operating loss carried forward. We also recognized a valuation allowance
of 463,478 to write off our deferred tax asset since we are uncertain that we will be able to utilize the deferred tax asset to offset
future taxable income, resulting in a net deferred tax expense of 89,581 in the three months ended September 30, 2024. We did not have
current income tax provision in the three months ended September 30, 2023, due to net operating loss, and we recognized a deferred income
tax asset of 2,059, due to temporary differences recognized and a deferred income tax expense of 373,897 due to the change from an S
Corporation to a C Corporation upon the completion of our reorganization on September 23, 2023. Since our transition to a C Corporation
on September 23, 2023, ABL Chicago, our subsidiary in the U.S. is now obligated to pay federal tax at a rate of 21 and Illinois state
tax at a rate of 7.5 . This tax obligation was previously exempt for us as an S Corporation. 

Net Loss 

As a result of the foregoing,
we had a net loss of 1.3 million and 0.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

As of September 30, 2024,
we had a cash and cash equivalent balance of 2.7 million. Our current assets were 5.8 million, and our current liabilities were
 4.4 million, resulting in a current ratio of 1.3:1 and a positive working capital of 1.4 million. Total stockholders equity
as of September 30, 2024 was 3.6 million. 

As of September 30, 2024
and June 30, 2023, we had accounts receivable net of allowance of 2.3 million and 2.8 million, respectively. We periodically review
our accounts receivable and allowance level to ensure our methodology for determining allowances is reasonable and to accrue additional
allowances if necessary. For the accounts receivable, as of September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2023, we provided a credit loss
allowance of 66,903 and 54,066, respectively. 

In assessing our liquidity,
we monitor and analyze our cash on hand, our ability to generate sufficient revenue sources in the future, and our operating and capital
expenditure commitments. Historically, we have funded our working capital needs primarily through operations, loans, and working capital
loans from stockholders. Since our offering closed in July 2024, we plan to use the proceeds to meet our ongoing working capital requirements.
Our working capital requirements are influenced by the efficiency of our operations, the volume and dollar value of our revenue contracts,
the progress or execution of customer contracts, and the timing of accounts receivable collections.

Operating Activities 

Net
cash used in operating activities was 1,402,784 in the three months ended September 30, 2024, including net loss of 1,335,407, adjusted
for non-cash items for 612,895 and changes in working capital of negative 680,272. The non-cash items primarily included 466,723 amortization of operating lease assets, 36,159 depreciation included
in G A and cost of revenue, 7,595 depreciation of right-of-use finance assets and 12,837 from provision of allowance for expected
credit loss and a decrease of 89,581 from deferred tax asset due to recognition of valuation allowance. The adjustments for changes in
working capital mainly included a decrease of 402,895 and 156,850 in accounts payable third parties and related parties, respectively,
an increase of 77,812 in due from related parties because of rental income recognized for the three months ended September 30, 2024,
a decrease of 470,260 in operating lease liabilities and a decrease of 24,876 in accrued expense and
other payable, partially offset by a decrease of 282,864 and 257,924 in accounts receivable third parties and related parties,
respectively, due to a decrease of revenues near period end. 

Net cash provided by operating
activities was 40,357 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, including net loss of 307,285, adjusted for non-cash items for
 386,277, and changes in working capital of negative 38,635. The non-cash items primarily included 219,571 amortization of operating
lease assets, 36,160 depreciation included in G A and cost of revenue, 52,122 from provision of allowance for expected credit loss,
and impacted by a loss of 73,151 from deconsolidation of a subsidiary. The adjustments for changes in working capital mainly included
a decrease of 225,023 in operating lease liabilities, a decrease of 49,182 in due from related parties , an increase of 65,995 in accounts
receivable related parties and an increase of 138,491 in accounts receivable third parties reflecting the impact of revenue
growth combined with the timing of payments to third party providers, related parties and collections from clients on net working capital,
partially offset by an increase of 133,904 in accounts payable third parties, an increase of 141,213 in accounts payable 
related parties, an increase of 37,739 in accrued expenses and other payables, and a decrease of 26,213 in contract assets. 

The 1,443,141 increase in
cash used in operating activities in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year was primarily due to an increase
in net loss of 1,028,122 in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to same period in the prior year, together with an increase
of 641,637 in cash outflow from working capital due to timing of vendor payments, client payments and related parties payment. 

Investing Activities 

Net cash used in investing
activities was 38,279 and 78,799 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Net cash used in investing activities
for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was primarily attributable to our purchases of property and equipment and the prepayment
for the installation of a security system which was still in progress as of the period ended. On August 4, 2023, we reduced our unpaid
registered capital contribution in our investee company in China, namely ABL Wuhan, and concurrently, the third-party shareholders increased
their registered capital contribution accordingly. Following this change, the third-party shareholders own 80 of equity interest and
we own 20 of equity interest in ABL Wuhan. Consequently, ABL Wuhan ceased to be the Company s subsidiary after August 4, 2023.
Therefore, we had cash outflow of 48,893 upon deconsolidation of a subsidiary and payment for registered capital of 29,906 during the
three months ended September 30, 2023. 

Financing Activities 

Net cash provided by financing
activities was 4,044,402 and 66,760 in the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase in net cash provided
by financing activities was mainly due to the net proceeds of approximately 5,351,281 from the offering, partly offset by repayment of
 879,574 to shareholders, loans repayment of 265,456 and advancement to related party of 126,227 during the three months ended September
30, 2024. The net cash provided by financing activities for the three months ended September 30, 2023, was primarily attributable proceeds
from net proceed of loans of 102,863. 

39 

Capital Expenditures 

Our capital expenditures are
incurred primarily in connection with the purchase of fixed assets, including machinery and equipment, furniture and fixtures, leasehold
improvement and vehicles. Our capital expenditures amounted to 38,279 and nil in the three months ended September 30, 2024
and 2023, respectively. 

We expect that our capital
expenditures will increase in the future as our business continues to develop and expand. We intend to fund our future capital expenditures
with our existing cash balance, proceeds of loans, working capitals loans from stockholders and the proceeds from our IPO which was closed
in July 2024.

Off-Balance Sheet Commitments and Arrangements 

There were no off-balance
sheet arrangements as of and for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, that have, or that in the opinion of management are
likely to have, a current or future material effect on our financial condition or results of operations. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 

We prepare our consolidated
financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP, which requires us to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect our
reported amount of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs and expenses, and any related disclosures. Although there were no material changes
made to the accounting estimates and assumptions in the past two years, we continually evaluate these estimates and assumptions based
on the most recently available information, our own historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable
under the circumstances. Since the use of estimates is an integral component of the financial reporting process, actual results could
differ from our expectations as a result of changes in our estimates. 

Despite the fact that the
management determines there are no critical accounting estimates, the most significant estimates relate to allowance for credit losses,
for which we are required to estimate the collectability of accounts receivable, and contract asset relating to shipment in transit. 

The estimates were based on
a number of factors including historical experience, the age of the accounts receivable balances, the credit quality of customers, current
and reasonably expected future economic conditions, and other factors that may affect our ability to collect from customers. 

The estimated contract asset
is based on the estimated completion percentage of the performance obligation. We believe that customers simultaneously benefit from the
comprehensive services it provides. For customers with goods entering the United States, we offer customs clearance, container unloading,
storage, unpacking, packing, and transportation services to customer-specified locations after the goods arrive at a U.S. seaport
or airport. For customers shipping goods overseas, we provide cargo space arrangement, storage, packing, export customs clearance, and
transportation to the seaport or airport for loading. The performance obligation is satisfied over time as customers receive the benefits
of these services during the process of transporting goods from one location to another. As a result, we recognize revenue over time.
We believe that the methodology employed is comparable to that of other global logistics companies and offers faithful depiction of the
services rendered to customers. 

40 

While our significant accounting
policies are more fully described in Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our consolidated financial
statements, we believe that there were no critical accounting policies that affect the preparation of financial statements. 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements 

The Company considers the
applicability and impact of all accounting standards updates ASUs ). Management periodically reviews new accounting standards
that are issued. 

In November 2023, the FASB
issued ASU No. 2023-07, Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures (Topic 280). This ASU updates reportable segment
disclosure requirements by requiring disclosures of significant reportable segment expenses that are regularly provided to the Chief Operating
Decision Maker CODM and included within each reported measure of a segment s profit or loss. This ASU also requires
disclosure of the title and position of the individual identified as the CODM and an explanation of how the CODM uses the reported measures
of a segment s profit or loss in assessing segment performance and deciding how to allocate resources. The ASU is effective for
annual periods beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Adoption
of the ASU should be applied retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the financial statements. Early adoption is also permitted.
This ASU will likely result in us including the additional required disclosures when adopted. Management is currently evaluating the provisions
of this ASU and expect to adopt them for the year ending June 30, 2025. 

In December 2023, the FASB
issued ASU No. 2023-09, Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures (Topic 740). The ASU requires disaggregated information about
a reporting entity s effective tax rate reconciliation as well as additional information on income tax paid. The ASU is effective
on a prospective basis for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is also permitted for annual financial statements
that have not yet been issued or made available for issuance. This ASU will likely result in the required additional disclosures being
included in the Company s consolidated financial statements, once adopted. 

The Company does not believe other recently issued but not yet effective
accounting standards, if currently adopted, would have a material effect on the Company s unaudited consolidated balance sheets,
statements of income (loss) and comprehensive income (loss) and statements of cash flows. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 

We are a smaller reporting
company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), and are not required
to provide the information otherwise required under this item. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 

41 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Our management, with the participation
of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, has performed an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls
and procedures (as defined under Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this report. 

Based upon this evaluation,
our management concluded that as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective at the reasonable assurance
level due to the material weaknesses described below. 

We are lacking adequate segregation of duties and effective
risk assessment; and 

We are lacking sufficient written policies and procedures
for accounting and financial reporting with respect to the requirements and application of both the U.S. GAAP, and SEC guidelines. 

A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies,
within the meaning of PCAOB Auditing Standard AS2201, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility
that a material misstatement of the Company s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely
basis. We plan to address the weaknesses identified above by implementing the following measures: 

(i) Continuously hiring additional accounting staffs with comprehensive
