 In addition to historical information, this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties, and assumptions. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including but not limited to those set forth under the captions Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements, Item 1A. Risk Factors and elsewhere in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, as updated by our subsequent filings under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Furthermore, past operating results are not necessarily indicative of results that may occur in future periods. 
 Overview 
 We are a precision oncology company pioneering the discovery and development of small molecule, tumor-agnostic therapies targeting p53. p53 is a well-defined tumor suppressor protein known as the guardian of the genome, and normal, or wild-type, p53 has the ability to eliminate cancer cells. However, mutant p53 proteins can be misfolded and lose their wild-type tumor suppressing function. These p53 mutations are found in approximately half of all cancers. The field of p53 biology was established by our co-founder Dr. Arnold Levine when he discovered the p53 protein in 1979. We have leveraged more than four decades of research experience and developed unique insights into p53 to create a precision oncology platform designed to generate selective, small molecule, tumor-agnostic therapies that structurally correct specific mutant p53 proteins to restore their wild-type function. We are deploying our precision oncology platform to target p53 mutations and other p53-related cancers. 
 Since our formation in March 2013, we have devoted substantially all of our time and efforts to performing research and development activities and raising capital. We are not profitable and have incurred losses in each year since our inception. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company incurred net losses of 19.2 million and 35.7 million, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of 345.7 million. We do not currently have any product candidates approved for sale, and we continue to incur significant research and development and general administrative expenses related to our operations. We initiated a Phase 1/2 clinical trial, PYNNACLE, in October 2020 for our lead product candidate, PC14586 (rezatapopt). In October 2020, we were granted FDA Fast Track Designation of PC14586 for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors that have a p53 Y220C mutation. In July 2023, we concluded our End of Phase 1 meeting with the FDA with alignment on the recommended Phase 2 dose and key elements of the single arm, Phase 2 registrational portion of the PYNNACLE study. In October 2023, we presented our updated Phase 1 clinical data for PC14586 at the 2023 AACR-NCI-EORTC International Conference on Molecular Targets and Cancer Therapeutics Meeting. We are continuing to dose patients in the pivotal Phase 2 monotherapy portion of our PYNNACLE trial, and have activated over 75 of sites globally across the U.S., Europe and Asia-Pacific. In October 2024, we discontinued enrollment in the Phase 1b combination arm of the PYNNACLE trial evaluating rezatapopt in combination with Merck and Co. s anti-PD-1 therapy KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab) in patients with advanced solid tumors harboring a TP53 Y220C mutation. Additionally, we announced that we are collaborating with the MD Anderson Cancer Center and the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center to support an investigator-initiated Phase 1b study, which is designed to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and preliminary efficacy of rezatapopt monotherapy in combination with azacytidine in patients harboring a TP53 Y220C mutation. We expect that enrollment for this Phase 1b study will begin in the first quarter of 2025. We also expect to provide interim data on the Phase 2 monotherapy registrational portion of the PYNNACLE trial by mid-2025. 
 We expect that our operating expenses will increase significantly as we advance our product candidates through preclinical and clinical development, seek regulatory approval, and prepare for and, if approved, proceed to commercialization; acquire, discover, validate, and develop additional product candidates; obtain, maintain, protect, and enforce our intellectual property portfolio; and hire additional personnel. Furthermore, we have incurred and will continue to incur additional costs associated with operating as a public company that we did not experience as a private company. We expect to continue to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future. 
 15 

Our ability to generate product revenue will depend on the successful development, regulatory approval, and eventual commercialization of one or more of our product candidates. Until such time as we can generate significant revenue from product sales, if ever, we expect to finance our operations through private or public equity or debt financings, collaborative, or other arrangements with corporate sources, or through other sources of financing. Adequate funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. If we fail to raise capital or enter into such agreements as and when needed, we may have to significantly delay, scale back or discontinue the development and commercialization of our product candidates. 
 We plan to continue to use third-party service providers, including clinical research organizations, or CROs, and contract manufacturing organization, or CMOs, to carry out our preclinical and clinical development and to manufacture and supply the materials to be used during the development and commercialization of our product candidates. We do not currently have a sales force. 
 Components of Results of Operations 
 Revenue 
 To date, we have not generated any revenue from any sources, including from product sales, and we do not expect to generate any revenue from the sale of products in the foreseeable future. If our development efforts for our product candidates are successful and result in regulatory approval, or license agreements with third parties, we may generate revenue in the future from product sales. However, there can be no assurance as to when we will generate such revenue, if at all. 
 Operating Expenses 
 Research and Development Expenses 
 Our research and development expenses consist primarily of costs incurred to conduct research, such as the discovery and development of our product candidates as well as the development of future product candidates. Research and development expenses include personnel costs, including stock-based compensation expense, third-party contractor services, laboratory materials and supplies, and depreciation and maintenance of research equipment. We expense research and development costs as they are incurred. 
 We do not allocate our costs by product candidate or development program, as a significant amount of research and development expenses include compensation costs, materials, supplies, depreciation on and maintenance of research equipment, and the cost of services provided by outside contractors, which are not tracked by product candidate or development program. In particular, with respect to internal costs, several of our departments support multiple product candidate research and development programs, and therefore the costs cannot be allocated to a particular product candidate or development program. Substantially all of our research and development costs are associated with our lead product candidate, PC14586 (rezatapopt). We initiated a Phase 1/2 clinical trial in October 2020 for our lead product candidate, PC14586. In October 2020, we were granted FDA Fast Track Designation of PC14586 for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors that have a p53 Y220C mutation. In October 2023, we presented our updated Phase 1 clinical data for PC14586 at the 2023 AACR-NCI-EORTC International Conference on Molecular Targets and Cancer Therapeutics Meeting. We are continuing to dose patients, and have activated over 60 of sites globally across the US, Europe and Asia-Pacific, in the registrational, tumor-agnostic PYNNACLE Phase 2 trial of PC14586 in patients with advanced solid tumors harboring a TP53 Y220C mutation and KRAS wild-type (WT). In October 2024, we discontinued enrollment in the Phase 1b combination arm of the PYNNACLE trial evaluating rezatapopt in combination with Merck and Co. s anti-PD-1 therapy KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab) in patients with advanced solid tumors harboring a TP53 Y220C mutation. Additionally, we announced that we are collaborating with the MD Anderson Cancer Center and the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center to support an investigator-initiated Phase 1b study, which is designed to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and preliminary efficacy of rezatapopt monotherapy in combination with azacytidine in patients harboring a TP53 Y220C mutation. We expect that enrollment for this Phase 1b study will begin in the first quarter of 2025. We also expect to provide interim data on the Phase 2 monotherapy registrational portion of the PYNNACLE trial by mid-2025. 
 We expect our research and development expenses to increase substantially in absolute dollars in the future as we advance our product candidates into and through clinical trials and pursue regulatory approval of our product candidates. The process of conducting the necessary clinical research to obtain regulatory approval is costly and time-consuming. The actual probability of success for our product candidates may be affected by a variety of factors including: the safety and efficacy of our product candidates, clinical data, investment in our clinical program, the ability of any future collaborators to successfully develop our licensed product candidates, competition, manufacturing capability, and commercial viability. We may never succeed in achieving regulatory approval for any of our product candidates. As a result of the uncertainties discussed above, we are unable to determine the duration and completion costs of our research and development projects. 
 16 

General and Administrative Expenses 
 General and administrative expenses include personnel costs, expenses for outside professional services and other allocated expenses. Personnel costs consist of salaries, bonuses, benefits, and stock-based compensation. Outside professional services consist of legal, accounting and audit services and other consulting fees. Allocated expenses consist of rent expense related to our office and research and development facilities. We also expect to increase our general and administrative expenses as we advance our product candidates through preclinical research and development, manufacturing, clinical development, and commercialization. 
 Interest Income, Net 
 Interest income, net primarily consists of interest income from our interest-bearing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and interest costs related to accretion and amortization of discounts and premiums on marketable securities.

Research and development expenses were 16.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 13.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase of 3.3 million, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, was primarily due to the following: 
 4.1 million increase in research and development expenses associated with advancing our lead product candidate, PC14586, through the Phase 1/2 clinical trial; and 

0.7 million decrease in expenses for personnel related costs and stock-based compensation, primarily driven by decreased headcount from our reduction in force initiated in January 2024. 

General and Administrative Expenses 
 General and administrative expenses were 4.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 6.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease of 1.1 million, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, was primarily due to following: 
 0.9 million decrease in personnel expenses driven by a decrease in headcount and 0.2 million decrease in director and officer insurance fees. 

Interest Income, Net 
 Interest income, net primarily consists of interest income from our interest-bearing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and interest costs related to accretion and amortization of discounts and premiums on marketable securities. Interest income, net was 2.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024. The decrease of 0.4 million compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, is driven by less cash and investments in marketable securities and U.S treasuries during the three months ended September 30, 2024.

Research and development expenses were 44.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 42.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase of 2.3 million, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, was primarily due to the following: 
 2.5 million increase in research and development expenses, largely driven by increased contractual research organization costs; offset by 

0.2 million decrease in expenses for personnel related costs and stock-based compensation as a result of reduced headcount from our reduction in force initiated in January 2024. 

General and Administrative Expenses 
 General and administrative expenses were 15.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 18.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease of 3.2 million, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, was primarily due to following: 
 1.8 million decrease in personnel expenses driven by a decrease in headcount, 1.1 million decrease in facility and equipment expenses due to expiration of three leases, and 0.5 million decrease in director and officer insurance fees and legal expenses; offset by 

0.2 million increase in finance and legal support expenses. 

Interest Income, Net 
 Interest income, net primarily consists of interest income from our interest-bearing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and interest costs related to accretion and amortization of discounts and premiums on marketable securities. Interest income, net was 8.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The increase of 0.4 million compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, is driven by increased interest rates from cash and investments in marketable securities and U.S treasuries during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Income Tax Benefit 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company received 16.2 million of cash for the NOL and R D tax credit sales related to the tax years ended December 31, 2015 to 2022. The sale of the NOLs and R D tax credits have been recorded as an income tax benefit within the condensed consolidated statement of operations.

Sources of Liquidity 
 Since our inception, we have not generated any revenue from any product sales or any other sources and have incurred significant operating losses and negative cash flows from our operations. We have not yet commercialized any of our product candidates and we do not expect to generate revenue from sales of any product candidates for several years, if at all. As of September 30, 2024, we had cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities of 197.9 million and an accumulated deficit of 345.7 million. 
 On October 4, 2021, we filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3, as amended, (File No. 333-260012) with the SEC, or the Prior Shelf Registration Statement, which registered the offering, issuance, and sale of up to 200 million of various equity and debt securities and up to 150 million of common stock pursuant to an at-the-market equity offering program with Jefferies LLC, dated October 4, 2021, or the ATM Program. The Prior Shelf Registration Statement expired on October 4, 2024 and no shares of our common stock were able to be sold pursuant to the ATM Program following such date. We expect to file a new shelf registration statement on Form S-3 in order to, amongst other things, issue and sell common stock pursuant to the ATM Program. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we did not sell any shares of its common stock under the ATM Program. As of September 30, 2024, we have approximately 113.8 million remaining in gross proceeds available for future issuances of common stock under the ATM Program. 
 Contractual Obligations and Commitments 
 We enter into contracts in the normal course of business with CROs and other vendors to assist in the performance of our research and development activities and other services and products for operating purposes. These contracts generally provide for termination on notice, and therefore are cancelable contracts and not included in the table of contractual obligations and commitments. 
 In January 2021, we signed a lease for 50,581 square feet of office and laboratory space at One Research Way in Princeton, New Jersey. That lease term extends through 2032 and has a five-year extension option. Amounts related to future lease payments as of September 30, 2024, totaled 13.9 million, with 1.9 million to be paid within the next 12 months. In August 2024, the Company entered into a Lease Termination Agreement with BMR-One Research Way LLC, in connection with the termination of the lease at One Research Way in Princeton, New Jersey. Pursuant to the Termination Agreement, the Company and the Landlord agreed to terminate the lease, contingent on the sale of the property by the Landlord to a prospective new buyer. The sale to the new buyer was completed on October 1, 2024 and the lease was terminated on such date. 
 In September 2024, we signed two subleases, one for 14,201 square feet of office space at 400 Alexander Park Drive, Suite 301, in Princeton, New Jersey, to be used as our new headquarters 400 Alexander Sublease ), and the other for 3,025 square feet of office and laboratory space at 311 Pennington Rocky Hill in Hopewell, New Jersey, to be used for our new laboratory space 311 Pennington Sublease ). The 400 Alexander Sublease term extends until February 28, 2027, and the 311 Pennington Sublease term extends until December 2029 and has a three-year extension option. Amounts related to future lease payments for 311 Pennington Sublease as of September 30, 2024, totaled 0.8 million with 0.1 million to be paid within the next 12 months. Amounts related to future lease payments for 400 Alexander Sublease as of October 1, 2024 totaled 0.8 million with 0.3 million to be paid within the next 12 months.

Plan of Operation and Future Funding Requirements 
 We use our capital resources primarily to fund operating expenses, mainly research and development expenditures. On January 18, 2024, we announced a restructuring plan involving the reduction of our workforce by approximately 30 of our employees. All of the costs under the restructuring plan were incurred during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. We undertook these steps in order to streamline operations, reduce costs and preserve capital as we advance our lead candidate, PC14586, into late-stage development. At this time, due to the inherently unpredictable nature of preclinical and clinical development, we cannot reasonably estimate the costs we will incur and the timelines that will be required to complete development, obtain marketing approval and commercialize our current product candidates or any future product candidates, if at all. For the same reasons, we are also unable to predict when, if ever, we will generate revenue from product sales or whether, or when, if ever, we may achieve profitability. Clinical and preclinical development timelines, the probability of success, and development costs can differ materially from expectations. In addition, we cannot forecast which product candidates may be subject to future collaborations, when such arrangements will be secured, if at all, and to what degree such arrangements would affect our development plans and capital requirements. 
 Due to our significant research and development expenditures, we have generated substantial operating losses in each period since inception. We have incurred an accumulated deficit of 345.7 million through September 30, 2024. We expect to incur substantial additional losses in the future as we expand our research and development activities. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, our cash operating expenditures were 34.6 million and 43.6 million, respectively. Based on our research and development plans, we expect that our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities as of September 30, 2024 will be sufficient to fund our operations to the end of 2026. 
 We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, however, and we could use our capital resources sooner than we expect. 
 The timing and amount of our operating expenditures will depend largely on: 
 the timing and progress of preclinical and clinical development activities; 

the number and scope of preclinical and clinical programs we decide to pursue; 

the timing and amount of milestone payments we may receive under any future collaboration agreements; 

our ability to maintain future licenses and research and development programs and to establish new collaboration and/or in-licensing arrangements; 

the costs involved in prosecuting and enforcing patent and other intellectual property claims; 

the cost and timing of regulatory approvals; 

the costs involved in finalizing our announced reduction in force and related reorganization; and 

our efforts to manage our office and laboratory headquarters, enhance operational systems and hire additional personnel to support development of our product candidates and satisfy our obligations as a public company. 

Until such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial revenue from product sales, we expect to fund our operations and capital funding needs through equity and/or debt financing. We may also consider entering into collaboration arrangements or selectively partnering for clinical development and commercialization. The sale of additional equity would result in additional dilution to our stockholders. The incurrence of debt financing would result in debt service obligations and the instruments governing such debt could provide for operating and financing covenants that would restrict our operations or our ability to incur additional indebtedness or pay dividends, among other items. If we raise additional funds through governmental funding, collaborations, strategic partnerships and alliances or marketing, distribution, or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs or product candidates or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we are not able to secure adequate additional funding, we may be forced to make reductions in spending, extend payment terms with suppliers, liquidate assets where possible, and/or suspend or curtail planned programs. Any of these actions could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

Operating Activities 
 Net cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was 34.6 million, which consisted primarily of net loss of 35.7 million partially offset by non-cash charges of 4.1 million. Changes in our net operating assets decreased operating cash by 3.0 million. The non-cash charges primarily consisted of stock-based compensation of 7.6 million, accretion of discounts on marketable securities of 4.2 million, depreciation of 1.1 million, and non-cash lease income of 0.3 million. The change in our net operating assets and liabilities was primarily due to an increase in prepaid expenses and other assets, and a decrease in outstanding payables and accrued expenses. 
 Net cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, was 43.6 million, which consisted primarily of net loss of 53.2 million partially offset by non-cash charges of 6.5 million. Changes in our net operating assets increased operating cash by 3.1 million. The non-cash charges primarily consisted of stock-based compensation of 9.4 million, accretion of premiums on marketable securities of 3.5 million, depreciation of 0.9 million, and non-cash lease income of 0.3 million. The change in our net operating assets and liabilities was primarily due to a decrease in prepaid expenses and other assets, a decrease in outstanding payables and an increase in accrued expenses. 
 Investing Activities 
 Our investing activities provided 45.6 million of cash during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, which consisted primarily of maturities of marketable securities of 157.0 million, partially offset by purchases of marketable securities of 110.8 million, along with purchases of property and equipment of 0.6 million. 
 Our investing activities used 48.0 million of cash during nine months ended September 30, 2023, which consisted primarily of purchases of marketable securities of 187.1 million, along with purchases of property and equipment of 0.8 million, partially offset by maturities of marketable securities of 140.0 million. 
 Financing Activities 
 Our financing activities provided 0.1 million of cash during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. This consisted of 0.1 million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options. 
 Our financing activities provided 35.3 million of cash during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This consisted of 35.1 million of common stock issued under the ATM Program, net of issuance costs, and 0.2 million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options and issuance of common stock under the 2020 ESPP. 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates 
 The preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in those condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Although we believe that the estimates we use are reasonable, due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making those estimates, actual results reported in future periods could differ from those estimates. 
 22 

We believe that the accounting policies described below involve a high degree of judgment and complexity. Accordingly, these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our financial condition and results of our operations. During the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, there were no material changes to our critical accounting policies from those described in our audited condensed consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023, included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on February 29, 2024, except as noted below. 
 Research and Development Costs, Accrued Research and Development Costs and Related Prepaid Expenses 
 Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Research and development expenses consist principally of personnel costs, including salaries, stock-based compensation and benefits for employees, third-party license fees and other operational costs related to our research and development activities, including sourcing of raw materials and manufacturing of our product candidates, allocated facility-related expenses and external costs of outside vendors, and other direct and indirect costs. Non-refundable research and development advance payments are deferred and capitalized. The capitalized amounts are expensed as the related goods are delivered or services are performed. 
 As part of the process of preparing our condensed consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate our accrued research and development expenses. This process involves reviewing open contracts and purchase orders, communicating with our applicable personnel to identify services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for the service when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of actual costs. The majority of our service providers invoice us in arrears for services performed, on a pre-determined schedule or when contractual milestones are met; however, some require advance payments. We make estimates of our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date in the condensed consolidated financial statements based on facts and circumstances known to us at that time. We periodically confirm the accuracy of the estimates with the service providers and make adjustments if necessary. Examples of estimated accrued research and development expenses include fees paid to: 
 vendors, including research laboratories, in connection with preclinical development activities; 

CROs and investigative sites in connection with preclinical studies and clinical trials; and 

CMOs in connection with drug substance and drug product formulation of preclinical studies and clinical trial materials. 

We base our expenses related to preclinical studies and clinical trials on our estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to quotes and contracts with multiple research institutions and CROs that supply, conduct and manage preclinical studies and clinical trials on our behalf. The financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation, vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows. There may be instances in which payments made to our vendors will exceed the level of services provided and result in a prepayment of the expense. Payments under some of these contracts depend on factors such as the successful enrollment of patients and the completion of clinical trial milestones. In accruing service fees, we estimate the time period over which services will be performed and the level of effort to be expended in each period. If the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from the estimate, we adjust the accrual or the prepaid expense accordingly. Although we do not expect our estimates to be materially different from amounts actually incurred, our understanding of the status and timing of services performed relative to the actual status and timing of services performed may vary and may result in reporting amounts that are too high or too low in any particular period. To date, there have not been any material adjustments to our prior estimates of accrued research and development expenses. 
 Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
 For a description of recent accounting pronouncements, see Note 2 of the notes to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitati ve Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 We are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business. These risks primarily relate to interest rate risks. 
 We had cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities of 197.9 million and restricted cash of 0.8 million as of September 30, 2024. The Company s cash equivalents consist of interest-bearing U.S. treasury securities, money market funds, and corporate debt securities. Our exposure due to changes in interest rates is not material due to the nature and amount of our money-market funds and marketable securities. 
 23 

We are not currently exposed to significant market risk related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates; however, we may contract with foreign vendors that are located outside the United States in the future. This may subject us to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates in the future. 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SECs rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. 
 We carry out a variety of ongoing procedures, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to evaluate the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on the foregoing, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of September 30, 2024. 
 There have not been any changes in our internal control over financial reporting during our most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II OTHER INFORMATION 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings. 
 We are not currently involved in any litigation or legal proceedings that, in management s opinion, are likely to have any material adverse effect on the Company. 
 Item 1A. Ris k Factors. 
 There have been no material changes to the Company s risk factors as set forth in Part I, Item 1A of the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, as filed with the SEC on February 29, 2024, as supplemented by our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2024, as filed with the SEC on May 9, 2024. You should carefully review and consider the information regarding certain factors which could materially affect our business, financial condition or future results set forth under the heading Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, as filed with the SEC on February 29, 2024, and our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2024, as filed with the SEC on May 9, 2024. 
 Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equit y Securities and Use of Proceeds. 
 (a) Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities 
 None. 
 (b) Use of Proceeds 
 Our registration statement on Form S-1 (File No. 333-248627) relating to the IPO was declared effective by the SEC. The IPO closed on September 25, 2020 at which time we sold 13,529,750 shares of common stock (including the exercise in full by the underwriters of their option to purchase an additional 1,764,750 shares of common stock) at a public offering price of 18.00 per share. We received net proceeds from the IPO of approximately 223.2 million, after deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions of approximately 17.0 million and estimated offering related expenses of approximately 3.3 million. No offering expenses were paid or payable, directly, or indirectly, to our directors, officers, or persons owning 10 or more of any class of equity securities or to our affiliates. Goldman Sachs Co. LLC, BofA Securities, Cowen, and Evercore ISI acted as joint book-running managers for the offering. 
 There has been no material change in the planned use of proceeds from the IPO from that described in the prospectus filed with the SEC pursuant to Rule 424(b)(4) under the Securities Act on September 24, 2020. 
 On October 4, 2021, we filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3, as amended (File No. 333-260012), or the Prior Shelf Registration Statement, which was subsequently declared effective by the SEC on April 28, 2022. The Prior Shelf Registration Statement consisted of (i) a base prospectus pursuant to which we may offer and sell, from time to time, up to 200 million of shares of our common stock, shares of our preferred stock, various series of debt securities and warrants to purchase any of such securities in one or more registered offerings, and (ii) a prospectus supplement pursuant to which we may offer and sell, from time to time, up to 150 million of shares of common stock in at-the-market offerings. The Prior Shelf Registration Statement expired on October 4, 2024 and no shares of our common stock were able to be sold pursuant to the ATM Program following such date. We expect to file a new shelf registration statement on Form S-3 in order to, among other things, issue and sell common stock pursuant to the ATM Program. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company did not sell any shares of its common stock under the ATM Program. As of September 30, 2024, we have approximately 113.8 million remaining in gross proceeds available for future issuances of common stock under the ATM Program. There has been no material change in the planned use of proceeds as described in the Prior Shelf Registration Statement. None of the offering expenses were paid or payable, directly, or indirectly, to our directors, officers, or persons owning 10 or more of any class of equity securities or to our affiliates. 
 (c) Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities. 
 None. 
 Item 3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities. 
 None.
