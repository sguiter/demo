 Company Overview 
 Our mission is to unleash the potential of every team. 
 The Atlassian System of Work is our philosophy of how technology-driven organizations should work, connecting technology and business teams to accelerate progress and maximize team impact. Through a connected portfolio of products with discrete value propositions that are built on the Atlassian platform and data model, the Atlassian System of Work helps customers of any size align work to goals, plan and track work, and unleash their organization's collective knowledge. 
 Our primary products include Jira for planning and project management, Confluence for content creation and sharing, Jira Service Management for team service, management and support applications, Loom for asynchronous video collaboration, and Rovo for unlocking organizational knowledge. Together, our connected portfolio of products form integrated solutions and, when deployed in the cloud, provide customers all the benefits of analytics, automation, and AI, along with integrations with thousands of third-party apps as a solution that is deeply entrenched in how teams collaborate and how organizations run. The Atlassian platform is the common technology foundation for our products that drives connection between teams, information, and workflows. It allows work to flow seamlessly across tools, automates the mundane so teams can focus on what matters, and enables better decision-making based on the data customers choose to put into our products. 
 Our mission is possible with a deep investment in product development to create and refine innovative, high-value, and versatile products that users love. We make our products affordable for organizations of all sizes and transparently share our pricing online for most of our products. We aim to grow our customer base, targeting organizations of all sizes, in every industry, and in most geographies, and strategically expand our relationships with customers over time, including with our dedicated sales team. This product-led philosophy enables us to go to market in a unique and efficient way. To land new customers, we ve engineered a low-friction flywheel with an emphasis on self-service, making it easy to try and get value first and foremost. This allows us to operate at an unusual scale for an enterprise software company, with customers across virtually every industry sector in approximately 200 countries and territories as of September 30, 2024. Our customers range from small organizations that have adopted one of our products for a small group of users, to over eighty percent of the Fortune 500, many of which use a combination of our products across thousands of users. By designing our products to be simple, powerful, affordable, and easy to adopt, we generate demand through word-of-mouth and viral expansion within organizations, allowing our sales force to focus primarily on expanding and deepening strategic relationships with existing customers, particularly in the enterprise. 
 24 

Our high-velocity, low-friction distribution model is designed to drive exceptional customer scale by making products that are free to try and affordable to purchase online. We prioritize product quality, automated distribution, transparent pricing, and customer service to land new customers and expand to new teams. We also have a sales team focused primarily on expanding and deepening strategic relationships with existing customers, particularly large enterprises. We primarily rely on word-of-mouth and low-touch demand generation to drive trial, adoption, and initial expansion of our products. A substantial majority of our sales are automated through our website, including sales of our products through our solution partners and resellers. Our solution partners and resellers primarily focus on customers in regions that require local language support and other customized needs. We plan to continue to invest in our partner programs to help us enter and grow in new markets, complementing our automated, low-touch approach. 
 Our culture of innovation, transparency and dedication to customer service drives our success in implementing and refining this unique approach. We believe this approach creates a self-reinforcing effect that fosters innovation, quality, customer success, and scale. As part of this strategy, we invest significantly more in research and development activities than in traditional sales activities relative to other enterprise software companies. 
 We generate revenues primarily in the form of subscription fees. Subscription revenues consist primarily of fees earned from subscription-based arrangements for providing customers the right to use our software in a cloud-based-infrastructure that we provide Cloud offerings ). We also sell on-premises term license agreements for our Data Center products Data Center offerings ), consisting of software licensed for a specified period and support and maintenance services that are bundled with the license for the term of the license period. Subscription revenues also include subscription-based agreements for our premier support services. From time to time, we make changes to our product offerings, prices and pricing plans for our products which may impact the growth rate of our revenue, our deferred revenue balances, and customer retention. Subscription revenue, through our Cloud and Data Center offerings, results in a large recurring revenue base. 
 Economic Conditions 
 Our results of operations may vary based on the impact of changes in the global economy on us or our customers. Our business depends on demand for business software applications generally and for collaboration software solutions in particular. We are subject to risks and exposures from the evolving macroeconomic environment, including the effects of rising inflation, and increases in interest rates, political instability, and geopolitical tensions. We monitor the direct and indirect impacts of these circumstances on our business and financial results. The extent to which these risks ultimately impact our business, results of operations, and financial position will depend on future developments, which are uncertain and cannot be predicted at this time. 
 Key Business Metrics 
 We utilize the following key metrics to evaluate our business, measure our performance, identify trends affecting our business, formulate business plans and make strategic decisions. 
 Customer Base 
 We have a history of successfully growing both our total customer base and the spend per customer through growth in users and adoption of new products. We believe our ability to attract new customers is critical, and expanding within the existing customer base is the primary driver of our success as a business. Typically, new customers begin their journey with Atlassian products with a small footprint by either adopting our free editions or purchasing a single product for a limited number of users. We are focused on continuing to grow our total customer base, specifically the number of customers with more than 10,000 in annualized recurring revenue from our Cloud offerings Cloud ARR ), as it measures our ability to successfully expand within our existing customer base. 
 We define the number of total customers at the end of any particular period as the number of organizations with unique domains with an active subscription for two or more seats. We define the number of customers with Cloud ARR greater than 10,000 using the same definition as total customers with the distinction of having an active Cloud subscription and greater than 10,000 in Cloud ARR . We define Cloud ARR as the annualized recurring revenue run-rate of Cloud subscription agreements at a point in time. We calculate Cloud ARR by taking the Cloud monthly recurring revenue Cloud MRR run-rate and multiplying it by 12. Cloud MRR for each month is calculated by aggregating monthly recurring revenue from committed contractual amounts at a point in time. Cloud ARR and Cloud MRR should be viewed independently of revenue and do not represent our revenue under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles GAAP ), as they are operational metrics that can be affected by contract start and end dates and renewal rates. While a single customer may have distinct departments, operating segments, or 
 25 

subsidiaries with multiple active licenses or subscriptions of our products, if the product deployments share a unique domain name, we only include the customer once for purposes of calculating a customer. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had more than 300,000 customers. Including single user accounts and organizations who have only adopted our free or starter products, the active use of our products extends well beyond our total customer base. With these customers using our software today, we are able to reach a vast number of users, gather insights to refine our offerings, and generate growing revenue by expanding within our total customer base. Customers with greater than 10,000 in Cloud ARR represent the majority of our Cloud revenue. 
 The following table sets forth our number of customers with greater than 10,000 in Cloud ARR as of the dates presented: 
 As of September 30, 2023 December 31, 2023 March 31, 2024 June 30, 2024 September 30, 2024 Number of customers with greater than 10,000 in Cloud ARR 40,103 42,864 44,336 45,842 46,844 
 Includes an increase of 326 customers as a result of our acquisition of Loom. 
 Free Cash Flow 
 Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure that we calculate as net cash provided by operating activities less net cash used in investing activities for capital expenditures. Management considers free cash flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by our business that can be used to fund our commitments, repay our debt, and for strategic opportunities, such as reinvesting in our business, making strategic acquisitions, and strengthening our financial position. Free cash flow is not a measure calculated in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP, such as GAAP net cash provided by operating activities. In addition, free cash flow may not be comparable to similarly titled metrics of other companies due to differences among methods of calculation. The following table presents a reconciliation of net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow for the periods presented (in thousands): 
 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Net cash provided by operating activities 80,492 166,956 Less: Capital expenditures (6,151) (3,669) Free cash flow 74,341 163,287 
 Free cash flow decreased by 88.9 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in free cash flow was primarily attributable to a decrease in net cash provided by operating activities and an increase in capital expenditures. The decrease in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to an increase in cash paid to employees, including higher annual employee bonus payments, cash paid to suppliers, and cash used to pay income taxes, partially offset by an increase in cash received from customers. 
 For more information about net cash provided by operating activities, please see Liquidity and Capital Resources.

Components of Results of Operations 
 Sources of Revenues 
 Subscription Revenues 
 Subscription revenues consist primarily of fees earned from subscription-based arrangements for providing customers the right to use our software in a cloud-based-infrastructure that we provide. We also sell on-premises term license agreements for our Data Center offerings, which consist of software licensed for a specified period and include support and maintenance services that are bundled with the license for the term of the license period. Subscription revenues also include subscription-based agreements for our premier support services. Subscription revenues are driven primarily by the number and size of active licenses, the type of product and the price of the licenses. Our subscription-based arrangements generally have a contractual term of one to twelve months. For Cloud offerings, subscription revenue is recognized ratably as services are performed, commencing with the date the service is made available to customers. For Data Center offerings, we recognize revenue upfront for the portion that relates to the delivery of the term license, and the support and related revenue is recognized ratably as the services are delivered over the term of the arrangement. Premier support consists of subscription-based arrangements for a higher level of support across different deployment options, and revenue is recognized ratably as the services are delivered over the term of the arrangement. 
 Other Revenues 
 Other revenues primarily include fees received for sales of third-party apps in the Atlassian Marketplace. Advisory services and training services are also included in other revenues. Revenue from the sale of third-party apps via Atlassian Marketplace is recognized on the date of product delivery given that all of our obligations have been met at that time and on a net basis as we function as the agent in the relationship. Revenue from advisory services is recognized over the time period that the customer has access to the service. Revenue from consulting and training is recognized over time as the services are performed. 
 We expect subscription revenue to increase and continue to be our primary driver of revenue growth. M aintenance revenue related to our Server offerings is immaterial after the Server end of support date and has been classified in other revenues within our condensed consolidated statements of operations for all periods presented. 
 Cost of Revenues 
 Cost of revenues primarily consists of expenses related to compensation expenses for our employees, including stock-based compensation, hosting our cloud infrastructure, which includes third-party hosting fees and depreciation associated with computer equipment and software, payment processing fees, consulting and contractors costs associated with our customer support and infrastructure service teams, amortization of acquired intangible assets, such as the amortization of the cost associated with an acquired company s developed technology, certain IT program expenses, and facilities and related overhead costs. To support our cloud-based infrastructure, we utilize third-party managed hosting facilities. We allocate stock-based compensation based on the expense category in which the employee works. We allocate overhead such as information technology costs, rent and occupancy charges in each expense category based on headcount in that category. As such, general overhead expenses are reflected in cost of revenues and operating expense categories. 
 We expect cost of revenues to increase as we continue to invest in our cloud-based infrastructure to support migrations and our Cloud customers. 
 Gross Profit and Gross Margin 
 Gross profit is total revenues less total cost of revenues. Gross margin is gross profit expressed as a percentage of total revenues. Gross margin can fluctuate from period to period as a result of changes in product mix. 
 We expect gross margin to modestly decrease due to the sales mix shift from Data Center offerings to Cloud offerings. This impact will be primarily driven by increased hosting costs and personnel costs to support our Cloud customers. 
 27 

Operating Expenses 
 Our operating expenses are classified as research and development, marketing and sales, and general and administrative. For each functional category, the largest component is compensation expenses, which include salaries and bonuses, stock-based compensation and employee benefit costs. We allocate overhead, such as information technology costs, rent, and occupancy charges in each expense category based on headcount in that category. 
 Research and Development 
 Research and development expenses consist primarily of compensation expenses for our employees, including stock-based compensation, facilities and related overhead costs, consulting and contractor costs associated with our software development teams, and certain IT program expenses. We continue to focus our research and development efforts on building new products, adding new features and services, integrating acquired technologies, increasing functionality, enhancing our cloud infrastructure and developing our artificial intelligence capabilities. 
 Marketing and Sales 
 Marketing and sales expenses consist primarily of compensation expenses for our employees, including stock-based compensation, marketing and sales programs, consulting and contractor costs, facilities and related overhead costs, and certain IT program expenses. Marketing programs consist of advertising, promotional events, corporate communications, brand building and product marketing activities such as online lead generation. Sales programs consist of activities and teams focused on supporting our solution partners and resellers, tracking channel sales activity, supporting and servicing our customers by helping them optimize their experience and expand the use of our products across their organizations and helping product evaluators learn how they can use our tools most effectively. 
 General and Administrative 
 General and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation expenses for our employees, including stock-based compensation, for finance, legal, human resources and information technology personnel, facilities and related overhead costs, consulting and contractor costs, certain IT program expenses, and other corporate expenses. 
 Income Taxes 
 Provision for income taxes consists primarily of income taxes related to federal, state, and foreign jurisdictions where we conduct business. 
 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 Our condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed consolidated financial statements, as well as the reported revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. These items are monitored and analyzed by us for changes in facts and circumstances, and material changes in these estimates could occur in the future. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Changes in estimates are reflected in reported results for the period in which they become known. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions and such differences could be material. 
 There have been no significant changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates during the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the critical accounting estimates disclosed in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Results of Operations included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal year 2024. 
 New Accounting Pronouncements Pending Adoption 
 The impact of recently issued accounting standards is set forth in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies , of the notes to our condensed consolidated financial statements.

 Interest income increased 3.3 million, or 13 in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 . The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in investment income as a result of increased investment balances. 
 Interest Expense Three Months Ended September 30, (in thousands, except percentage data) 2024 2023 Change Change Interest expense (7,318) (8,976) 1,658 (18) 
 Interest expense decreased 1.7 million, or 18 in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 . The decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in interest expense on our outstanding debt as a result of the issuance of the Notes (as defined below), and repayment of the Term Loan (as defined below) in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024. 
 Provision for Income Taxes Three Months Ended September 30, (in thousands, except percentage data) 2024 2023 Change Change Provision for income taxes (93,605) (20,929) (72,676) 347 Effective tax rate 
 Not meaningful 
 Provision for income taxes increased 72.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to the change in the mix of earnings and losses in foreign jurisdictions. See Note 14, Income Taxes , of the notes to our condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information. 
 Our future effective annual tax rate may be materially impacted by the expense or benefit from tax amounts associated with our foreign earnings that are taxed at rates different from the federal statutory rate, level of profit before tax, accounting for uncertain tax positions, business combinations, changes in our valuation allowances to 
 31 

the extent sufficient positive evidence becomes available, closure of statute of limitations or settlement of tax audits, and changes in tax laws. 
 A significant amount of our earnings is generated by our Australian subsidiaries. Our future effective tax rates may be adversely affected to the extent earnings are lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory tax rates. Changes in our global operations could result in changes to our effective tax rates, future cash flows, and overall profitability of our operations. 
 We recognize the tax benefit of an uncertain tax position only if we conclude it is more likely than not that the position is sustainable upon examination by the taxing authority, based on the technical merits. The tax benefit recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit which is greater than 50 percent likely to be realized upon settlement with the taxing authority. We believe we have provided adequate reserves for income tax uncertainties in all open tax years. Based on the information currently available, we do not anticipate a material change in unrecognized tax benefits in the next 12 months. 
 The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development introduced a framework for a global minimum corporate income tax of 15 known as the Global Anti-Base Erosion rules. This legislation has been enacted in certain jurisdictions where we operate and is effective for our fiscal year 2025. As of September 30, 2024, the global minimum tax does not have a significant impact on our financial statements. As additional jurisdictions enact legislation, transitional rules lapse, and other provisions of the global minimum tax legislation become effective, our effective tax rate and cash tax payments may increase in future years. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents totaling 2.1 billion, marketable securities totaling 161.4 million and accounts receivables totaling 484.1 million. Since our inception, we have primarily financed our operations through cash flows generated by operations and corporate debt. 
 Our cash flows from operating activities, investing activities, and financing activities for the periods presented were as follows (in thousands): Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Net cash provided by operating activities 80,492 166,956 Net cash used in investing activities (18,690) (56,903) Net cash used in financing activities (186,753) (65,879) Effect of foreign exchange rate changes on cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash 3,564 (3,280) Net increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash (121,387) 40,894 
 Our primary source of cash is through collections from our customers. Our primary uses of cash from operating activities are general business expenses including employment expenses, cloud platform and other infrastructure services, income taxes, professional services fees, marketing expenses, software expenses, and facility expenses. 
 Net cash provided by operating activities decreased by 86.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The net decrease was primarily attributable to an increase in cash paid to employees, including higher annual employee bonus payments, cash paid to suppliers, and cash used to pay income taxes, partially offset by an increase in cash received from customers. 
 Net cash used in investing activities decreased by 38.2 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The net decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in net outflows of 71.8 million related to marketable securities activity, partially offset by an increase in net outflows of 26.1 million related to strategic investment activity and an increase in cash outflows for acquisitions, net of cash acquired, of approximately 5.0 million. 
 Net cash used in financing activities increased by 120.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The net increase was primarily attributable to an increase in repurchases of Class A Common Stock of 117.7 million.

Material Cash Requirements 
 Debt 
 As of September 30, 2024 , we had 500.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.250 senior notes due 2029 (the 2029 Notes and 500.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.500 senior notes due 2034 (the 2034 Notes, and together with the 2029 Notes, the Notes ). The 2029 Notes and the 2034 Notes will mature on May 15, 2029 and May 15, 2034, respectively. Interest on the Notes will be paid semi-annually in arrears on May 15 and November 15 of each year, starting from November 15, 2024. 
 In August 2024, our prior credit facility was amended and restated to provide for a 750 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the 2024 Credit Facility ). We may repay outstanding loans under the 2024 Credit Facility at any time, without premium or penalty, and we have an option to request an increase of 250 million in certain circumstances. The 2024 Credit Facility replaced our prior credit facility entered into in October 2020, which provided for a 1 billion senior unsecured delayed-draw term loan facility (the Term Loan and a 500 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility. Refer to Note 9, Debt, to our condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information. 
 Share Repurchase Programs 
 In January 2023, the Board of Directors authorized a program to repurchase up to 1.0 billion of our outstanding Class A Common Stock (the 2023 Repurchase Program ). In September 2024, the Board of Directors authorized a new program under which we may repurchase up to an additional 1.5 billion of our outstanding Class A Common Stock (the 2024 Repurchase Program and, together with the 2023 Repurchase Program, the Repurchase Programs ). The 2024 Repurchase Program will commence following completion of the 2023 Repurchase Program. The Share Repurchase Programs do not have a fixed expiration date, may be suspended or discontinued at any time, and do not obligate us to repurchase any specific dollar amount or to acquire any specific number of shares. 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we repurchased and subsequently retired approximately 1.1 million shares of our Class A Common Stock for approximately 183.9 million at an average price per share of 162.57. All repurchases were made in open market transactions. As of September 30, 2024, we were authorized to purchase a remaining 267.9 million and 1.5 billion of our Class A Common Stock under the 2023 Share Repurchase Program and 2024 Share Repurchase Program, respectively. 
 Contractual Obligations 
 Our principal commitments consist of contractual commitments for our cloud services platform and other infrastructure services, and obligations under leases for office space including obligations for leases that have not yet commenced. There were no material changes outside the ordinary course of business to our contractual obligations disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal year 2024. 
 Other Future Obligations 
 We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, together with cash generated from operations, and borrowing capacity from the 2024 Credit Facility will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next 12 months. Our other future cash requirements will depend on many factors including our growth rate, the timing and extent of spend on research and development efforts, employee headcount, marketing and sales activities, payments to tax authorities, acquisitions of additional businesses and technologies, the introduction of new software and services offerings, enhancements to our existing software and services offerings and the continued market acceptance of our products. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we are not party to any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources. 
 
 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 In addition to the measures presented in our condensed consolidated financial statements, we regularly review other measures that are not presented in accordance with GAAP, defined as non-GAAP financial measures by the SEC, to evaluate our business, measure our performance, identify trends, prepare financial forecasts and make strategic decisions. The key measures we consider are non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP net income per diluted 
 33 

share and free cash flow (collectively, the Non-GAAP Financial Measures ). These Non-GAAP Financial Measures, which may be different from similarly titled non-GAAP measures used by other companies, provide supplemental information regarding our operating performance on a non-GAAP basis that excludes certain gains, losses and charges of a non-cash nature or that occur relatively infrequently and/or that management considers to be unrelated to our core operations. Management believes that tracking and presenting these Non-GAAP Financial Measures provides management, our board of directors, investors and the analyst community with the ability to better evaluate matters such as: our ongoing core operations, including comparisons between periods and against other companies in our industry; our ability to generate cash to service our debt and fund our operations; and the underlying business trends that are affecting our performance. 
 Our Non-GAAP Financial Measures include: 
 Non-GAAP gross profit and non-GAAP gross margin . Excludes expenses related to stock-based compensation and amortization of acquired intangible assets. 
 Non-GAAP operating income and non-GAAP operating margin . Excludes expenses related to stock-based compensation and amortization of acquired intangible assets. 
 Non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per diluted share . Excludes expenses related to stock-based compensation, amortization of acquired intangible assets, gain on a non-cash sale of a controlling interest of a subsidiary and the related income tax adjustments. 
 Free cash flow . Free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures, which consists of purchases of property and equipment. 
 We understand that although these Non-GAAP Financial Measures are frequently used by investors and the analyst community in their evaluation of our financial performance, these measures have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider them in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. We compensate for such limitations by reconciling these Non-GAAP Financial Measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures. 
 The following table presents a reconciliation of our Non-GAAP Financial Measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measure for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands, except percentage and per share data):

(1) We utilize a fixed long-term projected non-GAAP tax rate in our computation of the non-GAAP income tax adjustments in order to provide better consistency across interim reporting periods. In projecting this long-term non-GAAP tax rate, we utilized a three-year financial projection that excludes the direct and indirect income tax effects of the other non-GAAP adjustments reflected above. Additionally, we considered our current operating structure and other factors such as our existing tax positions in various jurisdictions and key legislation in major jurisdictions where we operate. For fiscal year 2025, we determined the projected non-GAAP tax rate to be 26 . This fixed long-term projected non-GAAP tax rate eliminates the effects of non-recurring and period specific items which can vary in size and frequency. Examples of the non-recurring and period specific items include but are not limited to changes in the valuation allowance related to deferred tax assets, effects resulting from acquisitions, and unusual or infrequently occurring items. We will periodically re-evaluate this long-term rate, as necessary, for significant events. The rate could be subject to change for a variety of reasons, for example, significant changes in the geographic earnings mix or fundamental tax law changes in major jurisdictions where we operate. 
 (2) The effects of these dilutive securities were not included in the GAAP calculation of diluted net loss per share for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 because the effect would have been anti-dilutive. 
 
 ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 There have been no material changes to our market risk from the information presented in Part II, Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2024. 
 
 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, after evaluating the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of September 30, 2024, have concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is (1) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and (2) is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by Rules 13a-15(d) and 15d-15(d) under the Exchange Act that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that has materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures 
 In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.

PART II 
 
 ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
 On February 3, 2023, a putative securities class action (the Putative Class Action was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, captioned City of Hollywood Firefighters Pension Fund vs. Atlassian Corporation , Case No. 3:23-cv-00519, naming the Company and certain of its officers as defendants. The lawsuit was purportedly brought on behalf of purchasers of the Company s securities between August 5, 2022 and November 3, 2022 (the Class Period ). The complaint alleged claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, based on allegedly false and misleading statements about the Company s business and prospects during the Class Period. The lawsuit sought unspecified damages. On January 22, 2024, the court granted the defendants motion to dismiss plaintiffs complaint with leave to amend. Plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint on March 1, 2024 and the defendants filed a motion to dismiss on April 19, 2024. On August 13, 2024, the court issued a ruling granting the defendants motion to dismiss plaintiffs second amended complaint. Plaintiffs did not file a third amended complaint or an appeal. 
 In March, April and August 2023, three stockholder derivative lawsuits were filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware against the members of the Company s board of directors and certain of its officers, captioned Silva v. Cannon-Brookes , Case No. 1:23-cv-00283; Keane v. Cannon-Brookes , Case No. 1:23-cv-00399; and Azzawi v. Cannon-Brookes , Case No. 1:23-cv-00884. The Company is named as a nominal defendant. These stockholder derivative lawsuits are based largely on the same allegations as the Putative Class Action, including allegations relating to the Company s disclosures during the Class Period as well as, in certain instances, alleged insider trading. The lawsuits purport to assert claims for, among other things, breach of fiduciary duty, corporate waste, unjust enrichment, and violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act, and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder. The complaints seek unspecified damages and other relief purportedly on the Company s behalf. In May and August 2023, the Court consolidated the Silva, Keane, and Azzawi actions into In re Atlassian Corporation Stockholder Derivative Litigation , Case No. 1:23-cv-00283-GBW (the Consolidated Action ), and stayed the Consolidated Action pending resolution of any motion(s) to dismiss in the Putative Class Action. Following the dismissal of the Putative Class Action, the Consolidated Action was voluntarily dismissed without prejudice on October 18, 2024. 
 On September 6, 2023, a stockholder derivative lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California against the members of the Company s board of directors and certain of its officers, captioned Capistrano v. Cannon-Brookes , Case No. 4:23-cv-04584 (the Capistrano Action ). The Company is named as a nominal defendant. The complaint is based largely on the same allegations as the Putative Class Action and the Consolidated Action, including allegations relating to the Company s disclosures during the Class Period as well as, in certain instances, alleged insider trading. The lawsuits purport to assert claims for, among other things, breach of fiduciary duty, corporate waste, unjust enrichment, and violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act, and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder. The complaints seek unspecified damages and other relief purportedly on the Company s behalf. On October 31, 2023, the Court stayed the Capistrano Action pending resolution of any motion(s) to dismiss in the Putative Class Action. Following the dismissal of the Putative Class Action, the Capistrano Action was voluntarily dismissed without prejudice on October 17, 2024. 
 In addition to the matters discussed above, from time to time, the Company is party to litigation and other legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business. While the Company does not believe the ultimate resolutions of these other pending legal matters not described above are likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company s financial position, the results of any litigation or other legal proceedings are uncertain and as such the resolution of such legal proceedings, either individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on its business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. The Company accrues for loss contingencies when it is both probable that it will incur the loss and when it can reasonably estimate the amount of the loss or range of loss. For the periods presented, the Company has not recorded any liabilities as a result of the litigation or other legal proceedings in its condensed consolidated financial statements.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 
 
 A description of the risks and uncertainties associated with our business is set forth below. You should carefully consider such risks and uncertainties, together with the other information contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, and in our other public filings. If any such risks and uncertainties actually occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations could differ materially from the plans, projections and other forward-looking statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in our other public filings. In addition, if any of the following risks and uncertainties, or if any other risks and uncertainties, actually occur, our business, financial condition, or results of operations could be harmed substantially. 
 
 Risk Factor Summary 
 
 Our business is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including those highlighted in this section titled Risk Factors and summarized below. We have various categories of risks, including risks related to our business and industry, risks related to information technology, intellectual property, data security and privacy, risks related to legal, regulatory, accounting, and tax matters, risks related to ownership of our Class A Common Stock, risks related to our indebtedness, and general risks, which are discussed more fully below. As a result, this risk factor summary does not contain all of the information that may be important to you, and you should read this risk factor summary together with the more detailed discussion of risks and uncertainties set forth following this summary, as well as elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. These risks include, but are not limited, to the following: 
 
 Our historical rapid growth makes it difficult to evaluate our future prospects, and we may not be able to sustain our revenue growth rate or achieve profitability in the future. 
 The continuing global economic and geopolitical volatility, and measures taken in response, could harm our business and results of operations. 
 The markets in which we participate are intensely competitive, and if we do not compete effectively, our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be harmed. 
 Our quarterly results have fluctuated in the past and may fluctuate significantly in the future and may not fully reflect the underlying performance of our business. 
 Our use of generative AI and machine learning in our products, platform, and business, as well as our potential failure to effectively implement, use, and market these technologies, may result in reputational harm or liability, or could otherwise adversely affect our business. 
 We may encounter challenges to our business as we transition our business to focusing more on our Cloud offerings. 
 Our business depends on our customers renewing their subscriptions and purchasing additional licenses or subscriptions from us, and any decline in our customer retention or expansion could harm our future results of operations. 
 If we are not able to develop new products and enhancements to our existing products that achieve market acceptance and that keep pace with technological developments, our business and results of operations could be harmed. 
 If we fail to effectively manage our growth, our business and results of operations could be harmed. 
 If our marketing model is not effective in attracting new customers or we are unable to realize the benefits of our free trial strategy, our business and results of operations could be harmed. 
 Our business model relies on a high volume of transactions and affordable pricing. As lower cost or free products are introduced by our competitors, our ability to generate new customers could be harmed. 
 We may encounter challenges as we develop our enterprise sales force. 
 If our security controls are compromised, leading to unauthorized or inappropriate access to customer data, our products could be perceived as insecure, and such perception may result in the loss of existing customers, hinder our ability to attract new ones, and expose us to significant liabilities. 
 Interruptions or performance problems associated with our technology and infrastructure could harm our business and results of operations. 
 Real or perceived errors, failures, vulnerabilities, or bugs in our products or in the products on Atlassian Marketplace could harm our business and results of operations. 
 Privacy concerns and laws as well as evolving regulation of cloud computing, AI services, cross-border data transfer restrictions and other domestic or foreign regulations may limit the use and adoption of our services and adversely affect our business and results of operation. 
 Our current and future indebtedness may limit our flexibility in obtaining additional financing and in pursuing other business opportunities or operating activities. 
 38 

Our global operations and structure subject us to potentially adverse tax consequences. 
 The dual class structure of our common stock has the effect of concentrating voting control with certain stockholders, in particular, our Co-Founders and their affiliates, which will limit our other stockholders ability to influence the outcome of important transactions, including a change in control. 
 
 Risks Related to Our Business and Industry 
 Our historical rapid growth makes it difficult to evaluate our future prospects, and we may not be able to sustain our revenue growth rate or achieve profitability in the future. 
 We have experienced rapid growth in recent years and such growth rate should not be considered indicative of our future performance and may decline in the future. This rapid growth also makes it more challenging to evaluate our future prospects. Our revenue growth rate has fluctuated in prior periods and, in future periods, our revenue could grow more slowly than it has in the past or decline for a number of reasons, including any reduction in demand for our products, increase in competition, limitations on our ability to, or any decision not to, increase pricing, slower than anticipated adoption of or migration to our Cloud offerings, failure to capitalize on growth opportunities, contraction in our overall market, or impact from broader macroeconomic factors. Additionally, we ceased sales of new perpetual license Server offerings for our products in February 2021, and, subject to limited exceptions, ended maintenance and support for Server products in February 2024. Our revenue growth rates and profitability may be negatively impacted by Server customers that did not transition to our Cloud or Data Center offerings or Data Center customers that do not migrate to our Cloud offerings in the future. We make assumptions regarding the risks and uncertainties associated with our growth as we plan and operate our business. If our assumptions are incorrect or change, or if we do not address risks successfully, our operating and financial results could differ materially from our expectations, our growth rates may slow, and our business would suffer. 
 In addition, we expect our expenses to increase substantially in the near term, particularly as we continue to make significant investments in research and development and technology infrastructure for our Cloud offerings, expand our operations globally and develop new products and features for, and enhancements of, our existing products, including our AI products. As a result of these significant investments, and in particular stock-based compensation associated with our growth, we have not in the past and may not in the future be able to achieve profitability as determined under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles GAAP ). The additional expenses we will incur may not lead to sufficient additional revenue to maintain historical revenue growth rates and profitability. 
 The continuing global economic and geopolitical volatility, and measures taken in response, could harm our business and results of operations. 
 Large-scale international events in recent years, such as the COVID-19 pandemic and geopolitical instability and war in regions including Ukraine and the Middle East, have negatively impacted the global economy, disrupted global supply chains, and created significant volatility and disruption of financial markets. There was recently also a period of historically high inflation, which caused the Federal Reserve and other global central banks to tighten monetary policy, including issuing a series of interest rate hikes. This contributed to the failures of certain banking institutions and otherwise uncertain economic conditions. 
 
 Our business depends on demand for business software applications generally and for collaboration software solutions in particular. The market adoption of our products and our revenue is dependent on the number of users of our products. The continuing global economic and geopolitical volatility and uncertainty has and may continue to cause us and our customers to experience decreased demand for our products and services, increases in our operating costs (including our labor costs), reduced liquidity, and limits on our ability to access credit or otherwise raise capital. They could reduce the number of personnel providing development or engineering services, decrease technology spending, including the purchasing of software products, adversely affect demand for our products, affect our ability to accurately forecast our future results, cause some of our paid customers or suppliers to file for bankruptcy protection or go out of business, impact expected spending from new customers or renewals, expansions or reductions in paid seats from existing customers, negatively impact collections of accounts receivable, result in elongated sales cycles, and otherwise harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition. 
 
 In particular, we have revenue exposure to customers who are small- and medium-sized businesses. If these customers business operations and finances are negatively affected, they may not purchase or renew our products, may reduce or delay spending, or request extended payment terms or price concessions, which would negatively 
 39 

impact our business, results of operations, and financial condition. For example, rising interest rates and uncertain economic conditions contributed to the failures of banking institutions, such as Silicon Valley Bank and First Republic Bank, in 2023. While we have not had any direct exposure to failed banking institutions to date, if other banks and financial institutions enter receivership or become insolvent in the future in response to financial conditions affecting the banking system and financial markets, our ability or our customers ability to access existing cash, cash equivalents, and investments may be threatened and affect our customers ability to pay for our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition . 
 
 The extent to which global economic and geopolitical factors ultimately impact our business, results of operations, and financial position will depend on future developments, which are uncertain and cannot be fully predicted at this time. As a result of recent events, we have seen the revenue growth from existing customers moderate and experienced volatility in the trading prices for our Class A Common Stock, and such volatility may continue in the long term. Any sustained adverse impacts from these and other recent macroeconomic events could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, and earnings guidance that we may issue from time to time, which could have a material effect on the value of our Class A Common Stock. They could also heighten many of the other risks described in this Risk Factors section. 
 The markets in which we participate are intensely competitive, and if we do not compete effectively, our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be harmed. 
 The markets for our solutions are fragmented, rapidly evolving, highly competitive, and have relatively low barriers to entry. We face competition from both traditional, larger software vendors offering full collaboration and productivity suites and smaller companies offering point products for features and use cases. Our principal competitors vary depending on the product category and include Microsoft (including GitHub), IBM, Alphabet, ServiceNow, PagerDuty, Gitlab, Freshworks, BMC Software (Remedy), Asana, Monday.com, Notion and Smartsheet. In addition, some of our competitors have made acquisitions to offer a more comprehensive product or service offering, which may allow them to compete more effectively with our products. We expect this trend to continue as companies attempt to strengthen or maintain their market positions in an evolving industry. Following such potential consolidations, companies may create more compelling product offerings and be able to offer more attractive pricing options, making it more difficult for us to compete effectively. 
 Many of our current and potential competitors have greater resources than we do, with established marketing relationships, large enterprise sales forces, access to larger customer bases, pre-existing customer relationships, and major distribution agreements with consultants, system integrators and resellers. Our competitors, particularly our competitors with greater financial and operating resources, may be able to respond more quickly and effectively than we can to new or changing opportunities, technologies, standards, or customer requirements. With the adoption of new technologies, such as AI and machine learning, the evolution of our products, and new market entrants, we expect competition to intensify in the future. For example, our competitors may more successfully incorporate AI into their products, gain or leverage superior access to certain AI technologies, or achieve higher market acceptance of their AI solutions. In addition, as we continue to expand our focus into new use cases or other product offerings beyond software development teams, we expect competition to increase. Pricing pressures and increased competition generally could result in reduced sales, reduced margins, losses, or the failure of our products to achieve or maintain more widespread market acceptance, any of which could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, some current and potential customers, particularly large organizations, have elected, and may in the future elect, to develop or acquire their own internal collaboration and productivity software tools that would reduce or eliminate the demand for our solutions. 
 Our products seek to serve multiple markets, and we are subject to competition from a wide and varied field of competitors. Some competitors, particularly new and emerging companies with sizeable venture capital investment, could focus all their energy and resources on one product line or use case and, as a result, any one competitor could develop a more successful product or service in a particular market we serve which could decrease our market share and harm our brand recognition and results of operations. For all of these reasons and others we cannot anticipate today, we may not be able to compete successfully against our current and future competitors, which could harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition. 
 Our quarterly results have fluctuated in the past and may fluctuate significantly in the future and may not fully reflect the underlying performance of our business. 
 Our quarterly financial results have fluctuated in the past and may fluctuate in the future as a result of a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control. If our quarterly financial results fall below the 
 40 

expectations of investors or any securities analysts who follow us, the price of our Class A Common Stock could decline substantially. Factors that may cause our revenue, results of operations and cash flows to fluctuate from quarter to quarter include, but are not limited to: 
 our ability to attract new customers, retain and increase sales to existing customers, and satisfy our customers requirements; 
 the timing of customer renewals; 
 changes in our or our competitors pricing policies and offerings; 
 new products, features, enhancements, or functionalities introduced by our competitors; 
 the amount and timing of operating costs and capital expenditures related to the operations and expansion of our business; 
 significant security breaches, technical difficulties, or interruptions to our products or the third-party products on which we rely; 
 our increased focus on our Cloud offerings, including customer migrations to our Cloud products; 
 our ability to incorporate artificial intelligence solutions and features into our products, platform and business; 
 the number of new employees added or, conversely, any reductions in force; 
 changes in foreign currency exchange rates or adding additional currencies in which our sales are denominated; 
 the amount and timing of acquisitions or other strategic transactions; 
 extraordinary expenses such as litigation, tax settlements, adverse audit rulings or other dispute-related settlement payments; 
 general economic conditions, including any inflationary pressures and interest rate changes, that may adversely affect either our customers ability or willingness to purchase additional licenses, subscriptions, delay a prospective customer s purchasing decisions, reduce the value of new license or subscription, or affect customer retention; 
 the impact of U.S. and international political and social unrest, armed conflict, natural disasters, climate change, diseases and pandemics, and any associated economic downturn, on our results of operations and financial performance; 
 seasonality in our operations; 
 the impact of new accounting pronouncements and associated system implementations; and 
 the timing of the grant or vesting of equity awards to employees, contractors, or directors. 
 Many of these factors are outside of our control, and the occurrence of one or more of them might cause our revenue, results of operations, and cash flows to vary widely. As such, we believe that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our revenue, results of operations, and cash flows may not be meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance. 
 Our use of generative AI and machine learning in our products, platform, and business, as well as our potential failure to effectively implement, use, and market these technologies, may result in reputational harm or liability, or could otherwise adversely affect our business. 
 We have incorporated and expect to continue to incorporate AI and machine learning solutions, products and features, including generative AI solutions, products and features, into our products, platform, and business, which act on data-driven insights derived from both first and third-party applications. AI and machine learning solutions, products and features may become more important to our operations or to our future growth over time. There can be no assurance that the use of AI and machine learning solutions, products and features will enhance our products or services, produce intended results, or be beneficial to our business, including our efficiency or profitability, and we may fail to properly implement or market our AI and machine learning solutions, products and features. Our 
 41 

investments in AI solutions, products and features have and may continue to negatively impact our operating margins until we are able to increase revenue enough to offset these investments. Our competitors or other third parties may incorporate AI into their products, offerings, and solutions more quickly or more successfully than us, which could impair our ability to compete effectively and adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, suppliers of the third-party AI models we use in our products and platform could terminate their relationship with us, cease to make certain models available to us, or make certain models more expensive for us to use. Our ability to effectively implement and market our AI products, solutions and features will also depend, in part, on our ability to attract and retain employees with AI expertise, and we expect significant competition for professionals with such skills and technical knowledge. 
 Additionally, our use of AI and machine learning technologies may expose us to additional claims, demands, and proceedings by private parties and regulatory authorities and subject us to legal liability as well as brand and reputational harm. There are significant risks involved in utilizing AI and machine learning technologies, and in particular, generative AI technologies. For example, AI and machine learning algorithms may be flawed, insufficient, or of poor quality, reflect unwanted forms of bias, or contain other errors or inadequacies, any of which may not easily be detectable. AI and machine learning technologies have also been known to produce false or hallucinatory inferences or outputs. Further, inappropriate or controversial data practices by developers and end-users, or other factors adversely affecting public opinion regarding the use of AI and machine learning, could impair the acceptance of AI and machine learning solutions, including those incorporated into our products and services. If the AI and machine learning tools incorporated into our products and platform, or the content generated by such tools, is harmful, biased, inaccurate, discriminatory or controversial, our results of operations could suffer, including due to legal, competitive and reputational harm. Our customers may be less likely to utilize our AI and machine learning tools or may cease using our products or platform altogether. If we do not have sufficient rights to use the output of such AI and machine learning tools, or the data or other material or content on which the AI and machine learning tools we use rely, we also may incur liability through the violation of applicable laws and regulations, third-party intellectual property, privacy or other rights, or contracts to which we are a party. 
 In addition, we are subject to the risks of new or enhanced governmental or regulatory scrutiny, litigation, or other legal liability, ethical concerns, negative consumer perceptions as to automation and AI and machine learning technologies, any of which could adversely affect our business, reputation, or financial results. The technologies underlying AI and machine learning and their uses are subject to a variety of laws and regulations related to online services, intermediary liability, intellectual property rights, privacy, data security and data protection, consumer protection, competition and equal opportunity laws, and are expected to be subject to increased regulation and new laws or new applications of existing laws and regulations. AI and machine learning technologies are the subject of ongoing review by various federal, state and foreign governments and regulators, which are applying, or are considering applying, their platform moderation, privacy, data security and data protection laws and regulations to such technologies or are implementing, or are considering implementing, general legal frameworks for the appropriate use of AI and machine learning. As the legal, regulatory, and policy environments around AI and machine learning evolve, we may become subject to new legal and regulatory obligations in connection with our use of AI and machine learning technology, which could require us to make significant changes to our policies and practices, necessitating expenditure of significant time, expense, and other resources. We may not be able to anticipate how to respond to rapidly evolving legal frameworks, and we may have to expend resources to adjust our offerings in certain jurisdictions if the legal frameworks on AI and machine learning products are not consistent across jurisdictions. Accordingly, it is not possible to predict all of the risks related to the use of AI and machine learning technologies that we may face, and changes in laws, rules, directives, and regulations governing the use of AI and machine learning technologies may adversely affect our ability to use or sell these technologies or subject us to legal liability. 
 
 We may encounter challenges to our business as we transition our business to focusing more on our Cloud offerings. 
 We currently offer and sell both Data Center and Cloud offerings of certain of our products. For these products, our Cloud offering enables quicker setup and subscription pricing, while our Data Center offering permits more customization, a term license fee structure, and complete application control. Although a substantial majority of our revenue was historically generated from customers using our Server and Data Center products, over time our customers have moved and we expect them to continue to move to our Cloud offerings, resulting in our Cloud offerings becoming more central to our distribution model. As a part of this transition, we ceased sales of new 
 42 

perpetual licenses for our Server products in February 2021 and, subject to limited exceptions, ended maintenance and support for Server products in February 2024. 
 We may be subject to additional competitive and pricing pressures for our Cloud offerings compared to our Data Center offerings, which could harm our business. Further, revenues from our Cloud offerings are typically lower in the initial year compared to our Data Center offerings, which may impact our near-term revenue growth rates and margins, and we incur higher or additional costs to supply our Cloud offerings, such as fees associated with hosting our Cloud infrastructure. We have and expect to continue to see increased expenses and lower margins due such hosting costs increasing in this transition. Additionally, we offered discounts to certain of our enterprise-level Server customers to incentivize migration to our Cloud offerings, which impacted our near-term revenue growth. Our revenue growth rates and profitability may also be negatively impacted by Server customers that did not transition to our Cloud or Data Center offerings or Data Center customers that do not migrate to our Cloud offerings in the future. If our Cloud offerings do not develop as quickly as we expect, if we are unable to continue to scale our systems to meet the requirements of successful, large Cloud offerings, or if we lose customers currently using our Data Center products due to our increased focus on our Cloud offerings or our inability to successfully migrate them to our Cloud products, our business could be harmed. We are directing a significant portion of our financial and operating resources to implement robust Cloud offerings for our products and to migrate our existing customers to our Cloud offerings, but even if we continue to make these investments, we may be unsuccessful in growing or implementing our Cloud offering that competes successfully against our current and future competitors and our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be harmed. 
 Our business depends on our customers renewing their subscriptions and purchasing additional licenses or subscriptions from us, and any decline in our customer retention or expansion could harm our future results of operations. 
 In order for us to maintain or improve our results of operations, it is important that our customers renew their licenses or subscriptions when existing contract terms expire and that we expand our commercial relationships with our existing customers. Our customers have no obligation to renew their licenses or subscriptions, and our customers may not renew licenses or subscriptions with a similar contract duration or with the same or greater number of users. Our customers generally do not enter into long-term contracts; rather, they primarily have monthly or annual terms. Some of our customers have elected not to renew their agreements with us in the past and it is difficult to accurately predict long-term customer retention. 
 Our customer retention and expansion may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including our customers satisfaction with our products, new market entrants, our product support, our prices and pricing plans, the prices of competing software products, reductions in our customers spending levels, new product releases and changes to the packaging of our product offerings, mergers and acquisitions affecting our customer base, our increased focus on our Cloud offerings, our decision to end the sale of new perpetual licenses for our products, or the effects of global economic conditions and any related impacts on us or our customers, partners and suppliers. Additionally, we may be unable to timely address any retention issues with specific customers, which could harm our results of operations. If our customers do not purchase additional licenses or renew their subscriptions, renew on less favorable terms, or fail to add more users, our revenue may decline or grow less quickly, which could harm our future results of operations and prospects. 
 If we are not able to develop new products and enhancements to our existing products that achieve market acceptance and that keep pace with technological developments, our business and results of operations could be harmed. 
 Our ability to attract new customers and retain and increase revenue from existing customers depends in large part on our ability to enhance and improve our existing products and to introduce compelling new products that reflect the changing nature of our markets. The success of any enhancement to our products depends on several factors, including timely completion and delivery, competitive pricing, adequate quality testing, integration with existing technologies and our platform, and overall market acceptance. Any new product that we develop may not be introduced in a timely or cost-effective manner, may contain bugs or other defects, or may not achieve the market acceptance necessary to generate significant revenue. 
 The markets for our products are subject to rapid technological change, evolving industry standards, and changing regulations, as well as changing customer needs, requirements and preferences. These are all uncertain and we cannot predict the consequences, effects, or introduction of new, disruptive, emerging technologies or the manner and pace at which our markets develop over time, and our ability to compete in these markets depends on predicting and adapting to these changing circumstances. The success of our business will depend, in part, on our 
 43 

ability to adapt and respond effectively to these changes on a timely basis, and anticipating these factors requires that we allocate significant resources without any guarantee that any such investments and efforts will result in initial or enhanced adoption of our products in the marketplace. For example, with the development of next-generation solutions that utilize new and advanced features, including AI and machine learning, we have and expect to continue to commit significant resources to developing new products and enhancements incorporating AI and machine learning, and there is no guarantee that our investments and efforts will result in wider adoption of our products in the marketplace. If new technologies emerge that can deliver competitive products and services at lower prices, more efficiently, more reliably, more conveniently or more securely or if new products are introduced into the market that could render our existing products obsolete, such technologies and products could adversely impact our ability to compete effectively and may lead to customers reducing or terminating their usage of our products. 
 If we are unable to successfully develop new products, enhance our existing products to meet customer requirements, or otherwise gain market acceptance, our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be harmed. 
 If we cannot continue to expand the use of our products beyond our initial focus on software developers, our ability to grow our business could be harmed. 
 Our ability to grow our business depends in part on our ability to persuade current and future customers to expand their use of our products to additional use cases beyond software developers, including information technology and business teams. If we fail to predict customer demands or achieve further market acceptance of our products within these additional areas and teams, or if a competitor establishes a more widely adopted product for these applications, our ability to grow our business could be harmed. 
 We invest significantly in research and development, and to the extent our research and development investments do not translate into new products or material enhancements to our current products, or if we do not use those investments efficiently, our business and results of operations would be harmed. 
 A key element of our strategy is to invest significantly in our research and development efforts to develop new products and enhance our existing products to address additional applications and markets. In fiscal years 2024 and 2023, our research and development expenses were 50 and 53 of our revenue, respectively. If we do not spend our research and development budget efficiently or effectively on compelling innovation and technologies, our business could be harmed and we may not realize the expected benefits of our strategy. Moreover, research and development projects can be technically challenging and expensive. The nature of these research and development cycles may cause us to experience delays between the time we incur expenses associated with research and development and the time we are able to offer compelling products and generate revenue, if any, from such investment. Additionally, anticipated customer demand for a product we are developing could decrease after the development cycle has commenced, and we would nonetheless be unable to avoid substantial costs associated with the development of any such product. If we expend a significant amount of resources on research and development and our efforts do not lead to the successful introduction or improvement of products that are competitive in our current or future markets, it could harm our business and results of operations. 
 If we fail to effectively manage our growth, our business and results of operations could be harmed. 
 We have experienced and expect to continue to experience rapid growth, both in terms of employee headcount and number of customers, which has placed, and may continue to place, significant demands on our management, operational, and financial resources. We operate globally and sell our products to customers in approximately 200 countries and territories. Further, we have employees in Australia, Canada, France, Germany, India, Japan, the Netherlands, New Zealand, the Philippines, Poland, South Korea, Turkey, the U.S., and the United Kingdom (the UK ), and many of our employees have been with us for fewer than 24 months. We plan to continue to invest in and grow our team, and to expand our operations into other countries in the future, which will place additional demands on our resources and operations. As our business expands across numerous jurisdictions, we may experience difficulties, including in hiring, training, and managing a diffuse and growing employee base. 
 We have also experienced significant growth in the number of customers, users, transactions and data that our products and our associated infrastructure support. If we fail to successfully manage our anticipated growth and change, the quality of our products may suffer, which could negatively affect our brand and reputation and harm our ability to retain and attract customers. Finally, our organizational structure is becoming more complex and if we fail to scale and adapt our operational, financial, and management controls and systems, as well as our reporting systems and procedures, to manage this complexity, our business, results of operations, and financial condition 
 44 

could be harmed. We will require significant capital expenditures and the allocation of management resources to grow and change in these areas. 
 Our corporate values have contributed to our success, and if we cannot maintain these values as we grow, we could lose the innovative approach, creativity, and teamwork fostered by our values, and our business could be harmed. 
 We believe that a critical contributor to our success has been our corporate values, which we believe foster innovation, teamwork, and an emphasis on customer-focused results. In addition, we believe that our values create an environment that drives and perpetuates our product strategy and low-cost distribution approach. As we undergo growth in our customers and employee base, maintain a remote-first Team Anywhere work environment, and continue to develop the infrastructure of a public company, we may find it difficult to maintain our corporate values. Any failure to preserve our values could harm our future success, including our ability to retain and recruit personnel, innovate and operate effectively, and execute on our business strategy. 
 If our marketing model is not effective in attracting new customers or we are unable to realize the benefits of our free trial strategy, our business and results of operations could be harmed. 
 Our marketing model has relied on the strength of our products and organic user demand, driven by word-of-mouth marketing and viral expansion within organizations. We offer free trials, limited free versions and affordable starter licenses for certain products in order to promote additional usage, brand and product awareness, and adoption. If we are not able to organically attract customers, our revenue may grow more slowly than expected, or decline. In addition, high levels of customer satisfaction and market adoption are central to our marketing model. Any decrease in our customers satisfaction with our products, including as a result of our own actions or actions outside of our control, could harm word-of-mouth referrals and our brand. If our customer base does not continue to grow with our marketing model, we may be required to incur significantly higher marketing and sales expenses in order to acquire new subscribers, which could harm our business and results of operations. 
 In addition, our strategy of offering free trials, limited free versions or affordable starter licenses for certain products could be ineffective. Users may not perceive value in the additional benefits and services we offer beyond our free trials or limited free versions and, historically, a majority of users never convert to a paid version of our products from these free trials or limited free versions or upgrade beyond the starter license. Our marketing strategy also depends in part on persuading users who use free trials, limited free versions or starter licenses of our products to convince others within their organization to purchase and deploy our products. To the extent that these users do not become, or lead others to become, customers, we will not realize the intended benefits of this marketing strategy, and our ability to grow our business could be harmed. 
 Our business model relies on a high volume of transactions and affordable pricing. As lower cost or free products are introduced by our competitors, our ability to generate new customers could be harmed. 
 Our business model is based in part on selling our products at prices lower than competing products from other commercial vendors. For example, we offer entry-level or free pricing for certain products for small teams at a price that typically does not require capital budget approval and is orders-of-magnitude less than the price of traditional enterprise software. As a result, our software is frequently purchased by first-time customers to solve specific problems and not as part of a strategic technology purchasing decision. We have historically increased, and will continue to increase, prices from time to time. As competitors enter the market with low cost or free alternatives to our products, it may become increasingly difficult for us to compete effectively and our ability to garner new customers could be harmed. Additionally, some customers may consider our products to be discretionary purchases, which may contribute to reduced demand for our offerings in times of economic uncertainty, inflation and interest rate increases. If we are unable to sell our software in high volume, across new and existing customers, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be harmed. 
 We may encounter challenges as we develop our enterprise sales force. 
 In recent years, we have focused on strategically growing our sales force to expand and deepen our relationships with our existing customers, particularly in the enterprise. As our sales force develops, we may encounter challenges in identifying, recruiting, training, and retaining a qualified sales force, and we expect this growth to require significant time, expense, and attention. Expanding our sales infrastructure also has impacts on our cost structure and results of operations, and we may have to reduce other expenses, such as our research and development expenses, in order to accommodate a corresponding increase in marketing and sales expenses and maintain positive free cash flow. 
 45 

As our sales teams grow, we may face increased costs, longer sales cycles, greater competition and less predictability in completing our sales. For enterprise customers, the evaluation process may be longer and more involved, and require us to invest more in educating our customers about our products, services, and solutions, particularly because the decision to use our products, services, and solutions is often an enterprise-wide decision. We may be required to submit more robust proposals, participate in extended proof-of-concept evaluation cycles and engage in more extensive contract negotiations. In addition, our enterprise customers often demand more complex configurations and additional integration services and product features. Adverse macroeconomic conditions have in the past, and may in the future, cause delays in our enterprise customers purchasing decisions. Due to these factors, we often must devote greater sales support to certain enterprise customers, which increases our costs and time required, without assurance that potential customers will ultimately purchase our solutions. We also may be required to devote more services resources to implementation, which increases our costs, without assurance that customers receiving these services will renew or renew at the same level. Since the sales cycles for our enterprise offerings are multi-phased and complex, it is often unpredictable when a given sales cycle will close. Our revenue from enterprise customers may be affected by longer-than-expected sales and implementation cycles, extended collection cycles, potential deferral of revenue, and alternative licensing arrangements. 
 We derive a majority of our revenue from Jira and Confluence. 
 We derive a majority of our revenue from Jira and Confluence. As such, the market acceptance of these products is critical to our success. Demand for these products and our other products is affected by a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control, such as continued market acceptance of our products by customers for existing and new use cases, the timing of development and release of new products, features, functionality and lower cost alternatives introduced by our competitors, technological changes and developments within the markets we serve, and growth or contraction in our addressable markets. If we are unable to continue to meet customer demands or to achieve more widespread market acceptance of our products, our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be harmed. 
 We recognize certain revenue streams over the term of our subscription contracts. Consequently, downturns in new sales may not be immediately reflected in our results of operations and may be difficult to discern. 
 We generally recognize subscription revenue from customers ratably over the terms of their contracts. As a result, a significant portion of the revenue we report in each quarter is derived from the recognition of deferred revenue relating to subscription plans entered into during previous quarters. Consequently, a decline in new or renewed licenses and subscriptions in any single quarter may only have a small impact on our revenue results for that quarter. However, such a decline will negatively affect our revenue in future quarters. Accordingly, the effect of significant downturns in sales and market acceptance of our products, and potential changes in our pricing policies or rate of expansion or retention, may not be fully reflected in our results of operations until future periods. For example, the impact of economic uncertainties may cause customers to request concessions, including better pricing, which may not be reflected immediately in our results of operations. In addition, customers have in the past and may continue in the future to slow their rate of expansion or edition upgrades or reduce their number of licenses. We may also be unable to reduce our cost structure in line with a significant deterioration in sales. In addition, a significant majority of our costs are expensed as incurred, while a significant portion of our revenue is recognized over the life of the agreement with our customer. As a result, increased growth in the number of our customers could continue to result in our recognition of more costs than revenue in the earlier periods of the terms of certain of our customer agreements. Our subscription revenue also makes it more difficult for us to rapidly increase our revenue through additional sales in any period, as revenue from certain new customers must be recognized over the applicable term. 
 If the Atlassian Marketplace does not continue to be successful, our business and results of operations could be harmed. 
 We operate the Atlassian Marketplace, an online marketplace, for selling third-party, as well as Atlassian-built, apps. We rely on the Atlassian Marketplace to supplement our promotional efforts and build awareness of our products, and we believe that third-party apps from the Atlassian Marketplace facilitate greater usage and customization of our products. If we do not continue to add new vendors and developers, are unable to sufficiently grow the number of cloud apps our customers demand, or our existing vendors and developers stop developing or supporting the apps that they sell on the Atlassian Marketplace, our business could be harmed. 
 In addition, third-party apps on the Atlassian Marketplace may not meet the same quality standards that we apply to our own development efforts and, in the past, third-party apps have caused disruptions affecting multiple 
 46 

customers. To the extent these apps contain bugs, vulnerabilities, or defects, such apps have in the past and may in the future create disruptions in our customers use of our products, lead to data loss or unauthorized access to customer data, damage our brand and reputation, and affect the continued use of our products, which could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
 Any failure to offer high-quality product support could harm our relationships with our customers and our business, results of operations, and financial condition. 
 In deploying and using our products, our customers depend on our product support teams to resolve complex technical and operational issues. We may be unable to respond quickly enough to accommodate short-term increases in customer demand for product support. We also may be unable to modify the nature, scope and delivery of our product support to compete with changes in product support services provided by our competitors. Increased customer demand for product support, without corresponding revenue, could increase costs and harm our results of operations. In addition, as we continue to grow our operations and reach a global and vast customer base, we need to be able to provide efficient product support that meets our customers needs globally at scale. The number of our customers has grown significantly and that has put additional pressure on our product support organization. End customers may also reach out to us requesting support for third-party apps sold on the Atlassian Marketplace. In order to meet these needs, we have relied in the past and will continue to rely on third-party vendors to fulfill requests about third-party apps and self-service product support to resolve common or frequently asked questions for Atlassian products, which supplement our customer support teams. If we are unable to provide efficient product support globally at scale, including through the use of third-party vendors and self-service support, our ability to grow our operations could be harmed and we may need to hire additional support personnel, which could harm our results of operations. For example, in April 2022, a subset of our customers experienced a full outage across their Atlassian Cloud products due to a faulty script used during a maintenance procedure. While we restored access for these customers with minimal to no data loss, these affected customers experienced disruptions in using our Cloud products during the outage. Our sales are highly dependent on our business reputation and on positive recommendations from our existing customers. Any failure to maintain high-quality product support, or a market perception that we do not maintain high-quality product support, could harm our reputation, our ability to sell our products to existing and prospective customers, and our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
 If we are unable to develop and maintain successful relationships with our solution partners, our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be harmed. 
 We have established relationships with certain solution partners to distribute our products. We believe that continued growth in our business is dependent upon identifying, developing, and maintaining strategic relationships with our existing and potential solution partners that can drive substantial revenue and provide additional value-added services to our customers. For fiscal year 2024, we derived over 50 of our revenue from channel partners sales efforts. 
 Successfully managing our indirect channel distribution efforts is a complex process across the broad range of geographies where we do business or plan to do business. Our solution partners are independent businesses we do not control. Notwithstanding this independence, we still face legal risk and reputational harm from the activities of our solution partners including, but not limited to, export control violations, workplace conditions, corruption, and anti-competitive behavior. 
 Our agreements with our existing solution partners are non-exclusive, meaning they may offer customers the products of several different companies, including products that compete with ours. They may also cease marketing our products with limited or no notice and with little or no penalty. We expect that any additional solution partnerships we identify and develop in the future will be similarly non-exclusive and unbound by any requirement to continue to market our products. If we fail to identify additional solution partners in a timely and cost-effective manner, or at all, or are unable to assist our current and future solution partners in independently distributing and deploying our products, our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be harmed. If our solution partners do not effectively market and sell our products, or fail to meet the needs of our customers, our reputation and ability to grow our business could also be harmed. 
 If we are not able to maintain and enhance our brand, our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be harmed. 
 We believe that maintaining and enhancing our reputation as a differentiated and category-defining company is critical to our relationships with our existing customers and to our ability to attract new customers. The successful promotion of our brand attributes will depend on a number of factors, including our and our solution partners 
 47 

marketing efforts, our ability to continue to develop high-quality products, our ability to minimize and respond to errors, failures, outages, vulnerabilities, or bugs, and our ability to successfully differentiate our products from competitive products. In addition, independent industry analysts often provide analyses of our products, as well as the products offered by our competitors, and perception of the relative value of our products in the marketplace may be significantly influenced by these analyses. If these analyses are negative, or less positive as compared to those of our competitors products, our brand may be harmed. 
 The promotion of our brand requires us to make substantial expenditures, and we anticipate that the expenditures will increase as our market becomes more competitive, as we expand into new markets, and as more sales are generated through our solution partners. To the extent that these activities yield increased revenue, this revenue may not offset the increased expenses we incur. If we do not successfully maintain and enhance our brand, our business may not grow, we may have reduced pricing power relative to competitors, and we could lose customers or fail to attract new customers, any of which could harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition. 
 If we fail to integrate our products with a variety of operating systems, software applications, platforms and hardware that are developed by others, our products may become less marketable, less competitive, or obsolete and our results of operations could be harmed. 
 Our products must integrate with a variety of network, hardware, and software platforms, and we need to continuously modify and enhance our products to adapt to changes in hardware, software, networking, browser and database technologies. In particular, we have developed our products to be able to easily integrate with third-party applications, including the applications of software providers that compete with us, through the interaction of application programming interfaces APIs ). In general, we rely on the fact that the providers of such software systems continue to allow us access to their APIs to enable these customer integrations. To date, we have not relied on long-term written contracts to govern our relationship with these providers. Instead, we are subject to the standard terms and conditions for application developers of such providers, which govern the distribution, operation and fees of such software systems, and which are subject to change by such providers from time to time. Our business could be harmed if any provider of such software systems: 
 discontinues or limits our access to its APIs; 
 modifies its terms of service or other policies, including fees charged to, or other restrictions on us or other application developers; 
 changes how customer information is accessed by us or our customers; 
 establishes more favorable relationships with one or more of our competitors; or 
 develops or otherwise favors its own competitive offerings over ours. 
 We believe a significant component of our value proposition to customers is the ability to optimize and configure our products with these third-party applications through our respective APIs. If we are not permitted or able to integrate with these and other third-party applications in the future, demand for our products could decline and our business and results of operations could be harmed. 
 In addition, an increasing number of organizations and individuals within organizations are utilizing mobile devices to access the internet and corporate resources and to conduct business. We have designed and continue to design mobile applications to provide access to our products through these devices. If we cannot provide effective functionality through these mobile applications as required by organizations and individuals that widely use mobile devices, we may experience difficulty attracting and retaining customers. Failure of our products to operate effectively with future infrastructure platforms and technologies could also reduce the demand for our products, resulting in customer dissatisfaction and harm to our business. If we are unable to respond to changes in a cost-effective manner, our products may become less marketable, less competitive or obsolete and our results of operations could be harmed. 
 Acquisitions of, or investments in, other businesses, products, or technologies could disrupt our business, and we may be unable to integrate acquired businesses and technologies successfully or achieve the expected benefits of such acquisitions. 
 We have completed a number of acquisitions and strategic investments and continue to evaluate and consider additional strategic transactions, including acquisitions of, or investments in, businesses, technologies, services, products, and other assets in the future. For example, in fiscal year 2024, we acquired Loom, Inc., an 
 48 

asynchronous video messaging platform that helps users communicate through instantly shareable videos. We also from time to time enter into strategic relationships with other businesses to expand our products, which could involve preferred or exclusive licenses, additional channels of distribution, discount pricing or investments in other companies. 
 Any acquisition, investment or business relationship may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures. In particular, we may encounter difficulties assimilating or integrating the businesses, technologies, products, personnel, or operations of the acquired companies, particularly if the key personnel of the acquired companies choose not to work for us, their software and services are not easily adapted to work with our products, or we have difficulty retaining the customers of any acquired business due to changes in ownership, management or otherwise. Acquisitions may also disrupt our business, divert our resources, and require significant management attention that would otherwise be available for the development of our existing business. We may not successfully evaluate or utilize the acquired technology or personnel, or accurately forecast the financial impact of an acquisition transaction, including accounting charges. Moreover, the anticipated benefits of any acquisition, investment, or business relationship may not be realized or we may be exposed to unknown risks or liabilities. 
 In the future, we may not be able to find suitable acquisition or strategic investment candidates, and we may not be able to complete acquisitions or strategic investments on favorable terms, or at all. Our previous and future acquisitions or strategic investments may not achieve our goals, and any future acquisitions or strategic investments we complete could be viewed negatively by users, customers, developers or investors. 
 Negotiating these transactions can be time consuming, difficult and expensive, and our ability to complete these transactions may often be subject to approvals that are beyond our control. Consequently, these transactions, even if announced, may not be completed. For one or more of those transactions, we may: 
 issue additional equity securities that would dilute our existing stockholders; 
 use cash that we may need in the future to operate our business; 
 incur large charges, expenses, or substantial liabilities; 
 incur debt on terms unfavorable to us or that we are unable to repay; 
 encounter difficulties retaining key employees of the acquired company or integrating diverse software codes or business cultures; and/or 
 become subject to adverse tax consequences, substantial depreciation, impairment, or deferred compensation charges. 
 Risks Related to Information Technology, Intellectual Property, and Data Security and Privacy 
 If our security controls are compromised, leading to unauthorized or inappropriate access to customer data, our products could be perceived as insecure, and such perception may result in the loss of existing customers, hinder our ability to attract new ones, and expose us to significant liabilities. 
 Use of our products involves the storage, transmission, and processing of our customers proprietary data, including potentially personal or identifying information. Unauthorized or inappropriate access to, or security breaches of, our products could result in unauthorized or inappropriate access to data and information, and the loss, compromise or corruption of such data and information. In the event of a security breach, we could suffer loss of business, severe reputational damage adversely affecting customer or investor confidence, regulatory investigations and orders, litigation, indemnity obligations, damages for contract breach, penalties for violation of applicable laws or regulations, significant costs for remediation, and other liabilities. In addition, we rely on third-party service providers to host or otherwise process some of such data, and any failure by a third party, or any other entity in our collective supply chain, to prevent or mitigate data security breaches or improper access to, or use, acquisition, disclosure, alteration, or destruction of, such data could have similar adverse consequences for us. We have incurred and expect to incur significant expenses to prevent security breaches, including costs related to deploying additional personnel and protection technologies, training employees, and engaging third-party solution providers and consultants. Our errors and omissions insurance covering certain security and privacy damages and claim expenses may not be sufficient to compensate for all liabilities we may incur. 
 Although we expend significant resources to create security protections that shield our customer data against potential theft and security breaches, the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to systems or sabotage systems, or disable or degrade services, change frequently and are often unrecognizable until launched against a 
 49 

target, and therefore such measures cannot provide absolute security. We have in the past experienced breaches of our security measures and other inappropriate access to our systems. Certain of these incidents have resulted in unauthorized access to certain data processed through our products. Our products are at risk for future breaches and inappropriate access, including, without limitation, inappropriate access that may be caused by errors or breaches that may occur as a result of third-party action, or employee, vendor or contractor error or malfeasance, and other causes. We have in the past been, and may in the future be, a target of security threats, including from state actors. While these incidents have not materially affected our business, reputation or financial results, there is no guarantee they will not in the future. Third parties may also utilize our products and platforms for malicious purposes, such as to upload abhorrent content or host malware, which could result in reputational harm to us and negatively impact our business. 
 Additionally, the ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine may result in a heightened threat environment and create unknown cyber risks, including increased risk of retaliatory cyber-attacks from Russian actors against non-Russian companies. Our remote-first Team Anywhere work environment may pose additional data security risks. We also continue to build AI and machine learning into our products, which may result in security incidents or otherwise increase cybersecurity risks. Further, AI technologies may be used in connection with certain cybersecurity attacks, resulting in heightened risks of security breaches and incidents. 
 As we further transition to selling our products via our Cloud offerings, continue to collect more personal and sensitive information, and operate in more countries, our risks continue to increase and evolve. For instance, we rely on third-party partners to develop apps on the Atlassian Marketplace that connect with and enhance our Cloud offerings for our customers. These apps may not meet the same quality standards that we apply to our own development efforts and have in the past, and may in the future, contain bugs, vulnerabilities, or defects that pose data security risks to our customer or lead to the unauthorized access of user data. Our ability to mandate security standards and ensure compliance by these third parties may be limited. Additionally, our products may be subject to vulnerabilities in the third-party software on which we rely. We have in the past identified a vulnerability in an open source software application we used and similar incidents may occur in the future and could have a material adverse effect on our business. We are likely to face increased risks that real or perceived vulnerabilities of our systems could seriously harm our business and our financial performance, by tarnishing our reputation and brand and limiting the adoption of our products. 
 Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to or to sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not identified until they are launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. We may also experience security breaches that may remain undetected for an extended period and, therefore, have a greater impact on the products we offer, the proprietary data processed through our services, and, ultimately, on our business. 
 Data security breaches could also expose us to liability under various laws and regulations across jurisdictions and increase the risk of litigation and governmental or regulatory investigation. Due to concerns about data security and integrity, a growing number of legislative and regulatory bodies have adopted breach notification and other requirements in the event that information subject to such laws is accessed by unauthorized persons and additional regulations regarding security of such data are possible. We may need to notify governmental authorities and affected individuals with respect to such incidents. For example, laws in the EU and UK and all 50 U.S. states may require businesses to provide notice to individuals whose personal information has been disclosed as a result of a data security breach. Complying with such numerous and complex regulations in the event of a data security breach would be expensive and difficult, and failure to comply with these regulations could subject us to regulatory scrutiny and additional liability. We may also be contractually required to notify customers or other counterparties of a security incident, including a data security breach. Regardless of our contractual protections, any actual or perceived data security breach, or breach of our contractual obligations, could harm our reputation and brand, expose us to potential liability or require us to expend significant resources on data security and in responding to any such actual or perceived breach. 
 Interruptions or performance problems associated with our technology and infrastructure could harm our business and results of operations. 
 We rely heavily on our network infrastructure and information technology systems for our business operations, and our continued growth depends in part on the ability of our existing and potential customers to access our solutions at any time and within an acceptable amount of time. In addition, we rely almost exclusively on our websites for the downloading of, and payment for, all our products. We have experienced, and may in the future experience, disruptions, data loss and corruption, outages and other performance problems with our infrastructure and websites due to a variety of factors, including infrastructure changes, introductions of new functionality, human 
 50 

or software errors, capacity constraints, denial of service attacks, or other security-related incidents. In some instances, we have not been able to, and in the future may not be able to, identify the cause or causes of these performance problems within an acceptable period of time. It may become increasingly difficult to maintain and improve our performance, especially during peak usage times and as our products and websites become more complex and our user traffic increases. 
 If our products and websites are unavailable, if our users are unable to access our products within a reasonable amount of time, or at all, or if our information technology systems for our business operations experience disruptions, delays or deficiencies, our business could be harmed. Moreover, we provide service level commitments under certain of our paid customer cloud contracts, pursuant to which we guarantee specified minimum availability. If we fail to meet these contractual commitments, we could be obligated to provide credits for future service, or face contract termination with refunds of prepaid amounts related to unused subscriptions, which could harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition. From time to time, we have granted, and in the future will continue to grant, credits to paid customers pursuant to, and sometimes in addition to, the terms of these agreements. For example, in April 2022, a subset of our customers experienced a full outage across their Atlassian Cloud products due to a faulty script used during a maintenance procedure. While we restored access for these customers with minimal to no data loss, these affected customers experienced disruptions in using our Cloud products during the outage. We incurred certain costs associated with offering service level credits and other concessions to these customers, although the overall impact did not have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition. However, other future events like this may materially and adversely impact our results of operations or financial condition. Further, disruptions, data loss and corruption, outages and other performance problems in our cloud infrastructure may cause customers to delay or halt their transition to our Cloud offerings, to the detriment of our increased focus on our Cloud offerings, which could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
 Additionally, we depend on services from various third parties, including Amazon Web Services, to maintain our infrastructure and distribute our products via the internet. Any disruptions in these services, including as a result of actions outside of our control, would significantly impact the continued performance of our products. In the future, these services may not be available to us on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Any loss of the right to use any of these services could result in decreased functionality of our products until equivalent technology is either developed by us or, if available from another provider, is identified, obtained and integrated into our infrastructure. To the extent that we do not effectively address capacity constraints, upgrade our systems as needed, and continually develop our technology and network architecture to accommodate actual and anticipated changes in technology, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be harmed. 
 Real or perceived errors, failures, vulnerabilities, or bugs in our products or in the products on Atlassian Marketplace could harm our business and results of operations. 
 Errors, failures, vulnerabilities, or bugs may occur in our products, especially when updates are deployed or new products are rolled out. Our solutions are often used in connection with large-scale computing environments with different operating systems, system management software, equipment, and networking configurations, which may cause errors, failures of products, or other negative consequences in the computing environment into which they are deployed. In addition, deployment of our products into complicated, large-scale computing environments may expose errors, failures, vulnerabilities, or bugs in our products. Any such errors, failures, vulnerabilities, or bugs have in the past not been, and in the future may not be, found until after they are deployed to our customers. Real or perceived errors, failures, vulnerabilities, or bugs in our products have and could result in negative publicity, loss of or unauthorized access to customer data, loss of or delay in market acceptance of our products, loss of competitive position, or claims by customers for losses sustained by them, all of which could harm our business and results of operations. 
 In addition, third-party apps on Atlassian Marketplace may not meet the same quality standards that we apply to our own development efforts and, in the past, third-party apps have caused disruptions affecting multiple customers. To the extent these apps contain bugs, vulnerabilities, or defects, such apps may create disruptions in our customers use of our products, lead to data loss or unauthorized access to customer data, they may damage our brand and reputation, and affect the continued use of our products, which could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
 51 

Privacy concerns and laws as well as evolving regulation of cloud computing, AI services, cross-border data transfer restrictions and other domestic or foreign regulations may limit the use and adoption of our services and adversely affect our business and results of operation. 
 Regulation related to the provision of services over the internet is evolving, as federal, state and foreign governments continue to adopt new, or modify existing, laws and regulations addressing data privacy, cybersecurity, data protection, data sovereignty and the collection, processing, storage, hosting, transfer and use of data, generally. In the United States, the Federal Trade Commission and state regulators enforce a variety of data privacy issues, such as promises made in privacy policies or failures to appropriately protect information about individuals, as unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce in violation of the Federal Trade Commission Act or similar state laws. In addition, new U.S. state data privacy laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act CPRA ), and laws that have recently passed and/or gone into effect in many other states similarly impose new obligations on us and many of our customers, potentially as both businesses and service providers. These laws continue to evolve, and as various states introduce similar proposals, we and our customers could be exposed to additional regulatory burdens. In the European Economic Area EEA and the UK, data privacy laws and regulations, such as the European Union General Data Protection Regulation EU GDPR and United Kingdom General Data Protection Regulation and Data Protection Act 2018 (collectively, the UK GDPR, and, together with the EU GDPR, the GDPR ), impose comprehensive obligations directly on Atlassian as both a data controller and a data processor, as well as on many of our customers, in relation to our collection, processing, sharing, disclosure and other use of personal data. 
 We are also subject to evolving privacy laws on cookies, tracking technologies and e-marketing. For example, the Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act of 2003 establishes certain requirements for commercial email messages and specifies penalties for the transmission of commercial email messages that are intended to deceive the recipient as to source or content. In addition, certain states and foreign jurisdictions, such as Australia, Canada and the European Union EU ), have enacted laws that regulate sending email, and some of these laws are more restrictive than U.S. laws. In the EU and UK, informed consent is required for the placement of certain cookies or similar tracking technologies on an individual s device and for direct electronic marketing. Consent is tightly defined and includes a prohibition on pre-checked consents and a requirement to obtain separate consents for each type of cookie or similar technology. Recent European court and regulator decisions are driving increased attention to cookies and similar tracking technologies. 
 In addition, various safe harbors have historically been provided to those who hosted content provided by others, such as safe harbors from monetary damages for copyright infringement arising from copyrighted content provided by customers and others, and for defamation and other torts arising from information provided by customers and others. There is an increasing demand for repealing or limiting these safe harbors by either judicial decision or legislation. Loss of these safe harbors may require altering or limiting some of our services or may require additional contractual terms to avoid liabilities for our customers misconduct. 
 We monitor the regulatory, judicial and legislative environment and have invested in addressing these developments, and these new laws may require us to make additional changes to our practices and services to enable us or our customers to meet the new legal requirements, and may also increase our potential liability exposure through new or higher potential penalties for noncompliance, including as a result of penalties, fines and lawsuits related to data breaches. For instance, the Digital Services Act DSA in the EU came into force on November 16, 2022 and the majority of its substantive provisions took effect in February 2024. The DSA imposes new obligations around illegal services or content on our platform, traceability of business users, and enhanced transparency measures, and failure to comply can result in fines of up to 6 of total annual worldwide turnover. Record-breaking enforcement actions globally have shown that regulators wield their right to impose substantial fines for violations of privacy regulations, and these enforcement actions could result in guidance from regulators that would require changes to our current compliance strategy. Furthermore, privacy laws and regulations are subject to differing interpretations and may be inconsistent among jurisdictions. These and other requirements are causing increased scrutiny among customers, particularly in the public sector and highly regulated industries, and may be perceived differently from customer to customer. These developments could reduce demand for our services, require us to take on more onerous obligations in our contracts, restrict our ability to store, transfer and process data, require us to fundamentally change our business activities and practices or modify our products, or, in some cases, impact our ability or our customers' ability to offer our services in certain locations, to deploy our solutions, to reach current and prospective customers, or to derive insights from customer data globally. For example, in July 2020, the Court of Justice of the European Union CJEU invalidated the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework, one of the mechanisms that allowed companies, including Atlassian, to transfer personal data from the European Economic Area EEA to the United States. Even though the CJEU decision upheld the Standard 
 52 

Contractual Clauses as an adequate transfer mechanism, the decision created uncertainty around the validity of all EU-to-U.S. data transfers. While the EU and U.S. governments have recently adopted the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework to foster EU-to-U.S. data transfers and address the concerns raised in the aforementioned CJEU decision, it is uncertain whether this framework will eventually be overturned in court like the previous two EU-U.S. bilateral cross-border transfer frameworks. Certain countries outside of the EEA have also passed or are considering passing laws requiring varying degrees of local data residency. By way of further example, statutory damages available through a private right of action for certain data breaches under the CPRA and potentially other U.S. states laws, may increase our and our customers potential liability and the demands our customers place on us. As another example, jurisdictions are considering legal frameworks on AI, which is a trend that may increase now that the first such framework has entered into force in the EU. 
 The costs of compliance with, and other burdens imposed by, privacy laws, regulations and standards may limit the use and adoption of our services, reduce overall demand for our services, make it more difficult to meet expectations from our commitments to customers and our customers users, lead to significant fines, penalties or liabilities for noncompliance, impact our reputation, or slow the pace at which we close sales transactions, in particular where customers request specific warranties and unlimited indemnity for noncompliance with privacy laws, any of which could harm our business. We have adopted and continue to adopt data residency in certain territories. These services may enhance our ability to attract and retain customers operating in the relevant jurisdictions, but may also increase the cost and complexity of supporting those customers, the scope of our residency offering may not align with customer needs, and our customers may request similar offerings in other territories. 
 In addition to government activity, privacy advocates and other industry groups have established or may establish new self-regulatory standards that may place additional burdens on our ability to provide our services globally. Our customers expect us to meet voluntary certification and other standards established by third parties. If we are unable to maintain these certifications or meet these standards, it could adversely affect our ability to provide our solutions to certain customers and could harm our business. In addition, we have seen a trend toward the private enforcement of data protection obligations, including through private actions for alleged noncompliance, which could harm our business and negatively impact our reputation. In addition, a shift in consumers data privacy expectations or other social, economic or political developments could impact the regulatory enforcement of privacy regulations, which could require our cooperation and increase the cost of compliance with the imposed regulations. 
 Further, any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with our posted privacy policies, our privacy-related obligations to users or other third parties, or any other legal obligations or regulatory requirements relating to privacy, data protection or information security may result in governmental investigations or enforcement actions, litigation, claims or public statements against us by consumer advocacy groups or others and could result in significant liability, cause our users to lose trust in us, and otherwise materially and adversely affect our reputation and business. Furthermore, the costs of compliance with, and other burdens imposed by, the laws, regulations and policies that are applicable to the businesses of our users may limit the adoption and use of, and reduce the overall demand for, our platform. Additionally, if third parties we work with violate applicable laws, regulations or agreements, such violations may put our users data at risk, could result in governmental investigations or enforcement actions, fines, litigation, claims, or public statements against us by consumer advocacy groups or others and could result in significant liability, cause our users to lose trust in us and otherwise materially and adversely affect our reputation and business. Further, public scrutiny of, or complaints about, technology companies or their data handling or data protection practices, even if unrelated to our business, industry or operations, may lead to increased scrutiny of technology companies, including us, and may cause government agencies to enact additional regulatory requirements, or to modify their enforcement or investigation activities, which may increase our costs and risks. 
 Our business also increasingly relies on AI to improve our services and tailor our interactions with our customers. However, in recent years use of these methods has come under increased regulatory scrutiny. New laws, guidance and/or decisions in this area may limit our ability to use our AI models, or require us to make changes to our operations that may decrease our operational efficiency, result in an increase to operating costs and/or hinder our ability to improve our services. For example, there are specific rules on the use of automated decision making under the GDPR that require the existence of automated decision making to be disclosed to the data subject with a meaningful explanation of the logic used in such decision making in certain circumstances, and safeguards must be implemented to safeguard individual rights, including the right to obtain human intervention and to contest any decision. 
 53 

Finally, the uncertain and shifting regulatory environment and trust climate may raise concerns regarding data privacy and cybersecurity, which may cause our customers or our customers users to resist providing the data necessary to allow our customers to use our services effectively. In addition, new products we develop or acquire may expose us to liability or regulatory risk. Even the perception that the privacy and security of personal information are not satisfactorily protected or do not meet regulatory requirements could inhibit sales of our products or services and could limit adoption of our cloud offerings. 
 We may be sued by third parties for alleged infringement or misappropriation of their intellectual property rights. 
 There is considerable patent and other intellectual property development activity in our industry. Our future success depends in part on not infringing upon or misappropriating the intellectual property rights of others. We have received, and may receive in the future, communications and lawsuits from third parties, including practicing entities and non-practicing entities, claiming that we are infringing upon or misappropriating their intellectual property rights, and we may be found to be infringing upon or misappropriating such rights. We may be unaware of the intellectual property rights of others that may cover some or all of our technology, or technology that we obtain from third parties. Furthermore, the intellectual property ownership and license rights, including copyright, surrounding AI technologies has not been fully addressed by courts or national or local laws or regulations, and the use or adoption of third-party AI technologies into our products and services may result in exposure to claims of copyright infringement or other intellectual property misappropriation. Any claims or litigation could cause us to incur significant expenses and, if successfully asserted against us, could require that we pay substantial damages or ongoing royalty or license payments, prevent us from offering our products or using certain technologies, require us to implement expensive workarounds, refund fees to customers or require that we comply with other unfavorable terms. In the case of infringement or misappropriation caused by technology that we obtain from third parties, any indemnification or other contractual protections we obtain from such third parties, if any, may be insufficient to cover the liabilities we incur as a result of such infringement or misappropriation. We may also be obligated to indemnify our customers or business partners in connection with any such claims or litigation and to obtain licenses, modify our products or refund fees, which could further exhaust our resources. Even if we were to prevail in the event of claims or litigation against us, any claim or litigation regarding our intellectual property could be costly and time-consuming and divert the attention of our management and other employees from our business operations and disrupt our business. 
 Indemnity provisions in various agreements potentially expose us to substantial liability for intellectual property infringement and other losses. 
 Our agreements with customers and other third parties may include indemnification or other provisions under which we agree to indemnify or otherwise be liable to them for losses suffered or incurred as a result of claims of intellectual property infringement, damages caused by us to property or persons, or other liabilities relating to or arising from our products or other acts or omissions. The term of these contractual provisions often survives termination or expiration of the applicable agreement. Large indemnity payments or damage claims from contractual breach could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. Although we generally contractually limit our liability with respect to such obligations, we may still incur substantial liability related to them. Any dispute with a customer with respect to such obligations could have adverse effects on our relationship with that customer and other current and prospective customers, reduce demand for our products, damage our reputation and harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
 We use open source software in our products that may subject our products to general release or require us to re-engineer our products, which could harm our business. 
 We use open source software in our products and expect to continue to use open source software in the future. There are uncertainties regarding the proper interpretation of and compliance with open source software licenses. Consequently, there is a risk that the owners of the copyrights in such open source software may claim that the open source licenses governing their use impose certain conditions or restrictions on our ability to use the software that we did not anticipate. Such owners may seek to enforce the terms of the applicable open source license, including by demanding release of the source code for the open source software, derivative works of such software, or, in some cases, our proprietary source code that uses or was developed using such open source software. These claims could also result in litigation, require us to purchase a costly license or require us to devote additional research and development resources to change our products, any of which could result in additional cost, liability and reputational damage to us, and harm to our business and results of operations. In addition, if the license terms for the open source software we utilize change, we may be forced to re-engineer our products or incur additional costs to comply with the changed license terms or to replace the affected open source software. Although 
 54 

we have implemented policies and tools to regulate the use and incorporation of open source software into our products, we cannot be certain that we have not incorporated open source software in our products in a manner that is inconsistent with such policies. 
 Any failure to protect our intellectual property rights could impair our ability to protect our proprietary technology and our brand. 
 Our success and ability to compete depend in part upon our intellectual property. We primarily rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trade secret and trademark laws, trade secret protection and confidentiality or license agreements with our employees, customers, business partners and others to protect our intellectual property rights. However, the steps we take to protect our intellectual property rights may be inadequate. We make business decisions about when to seek patent protection for a particular technology and when to rely upon trade secret protection, and the approach we select may ultimately prove to be inadequate. Even in cases where we seek patent protection, there is no assurance that the resulting patents will effectively protect every significant feature of our products. In addition, we believe that the protection of our trademark rights is an important factor in product recognition, protecting our brand and maintaining goodwill and if we do not adequately protect our rights in our trademarks from infringement, any goodwill that we have developed in those trademarks could be lost or impaired, which could harm our brand and our business. In any event, in order to protect our intellectual property rights, we may be required to spend significant resources to monitor and protect these rights. 
 For example, we provide certain of our customers with the ability to request a copy of the source code of those products, which they may customize for their internal use under limited license terms, subject to confidentiality and use restrictions. If any of such customers misuse or distribute our source code in violation of our agreements with them, or anyone else obtains access to our source code, it could cost us significant time and resources to enforce our rights and remediate any resulting competitive harms. 
 Litigation brought to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights could be costly, time consuming and distracting to management. Furthermore, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights may be met with defenses, counterclaims and countersuits attacking the validity and enforceability of our intellectual property rights, which could result in the impairment or loss of portions of our intellectual property rights. Our failure to secure, protect and enforce our intellectual property rights could harm our brand and our business. 
 Risks Related to Financial Matters 
 We may require additional capital to support our operations or the growth of our business and we cannot be certain that we will be able to secure this capital on favorable terms, or at all. 
 We may require additional capital to respond to business opportunities, challenges, acquisitions, a decline in the level of revenue for our products, or other unforeseen circumstances. We may not be able to timely secure debt or equity financing on favorable terms, or at all. This inability to secure additional debt or equity financing could be exacerbated in times of economic uncertainty and tighter credit. For example, during periods of higher interest rates, as has occurred in recent years in the U.S. and other regions, debt financing may become more expensive. Our current Credit Facility and the indenture governing our Senior Notes (each defined below) contain certain restrictive covenants and any future debt financing obtained by us could involve restrictive covenants relating to financial and operational matters, which may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities, including potential acquisitions. If we raise additional funds through further issuances of equity, convertible debt securities or other securities convertible into equity, our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution in their percentage ownership of Atlassian, and any new equity or debt securities we issue could have rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our Class A Common Stock. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us, when we require it, our ability to continue to grow or support our business and to respond to business challenges could be significantly limited. 
 Our current and future indebtedness may limit our flexibility in obtaining additional financing and in pursuing other business opportunities or operating activities. 
 In May 2024, we issued 500 million aggregate principal amount of 5.250 senior notes due 2029 (the 2029 Notes and 500 million aggregate principal amount of 5.500 senior notes due 2034 (together with the 2029 Notes, the Senior Notes ). In August 2024, we amended and restated our prior credit facility to eliminate the senior unsecured delayed-draw term loan facility and provide for a 750 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the Credit Facility ). As of September 30, 2024, we had no outstanding revolving loans under the Credit Facility. 
 55 

Our Credit Facility requires compliance with various financial and non-financial covenants, including affirmative covenants relating to the provision of periodic financial statements, compliance certificates and other notices, maintenance of properties and insurance, payment of taxes and compliance with laws and negative covenants, including, among others, restrictions on the incurrence of certain indebtedness, granting of liens and mergers, dissolutions, consolidations and dispositions. The Credit Facility also provides for a number of events of default, including, among others, failure to make a payment, bankruptcy, breach of a covenant or representation and warranty, default under material indebtedness (other than the Credit Facility), change of control and judgment defaults. The indentures governing our Senior Notes contain certain negative covenants, including a limitation on liens and limitation on sale/leaseback covenants. 
 Under the terms of these covenants, we may be restricted from engaging in business or operating activities that may otherwise improve our business or from financing future operations or capital needs. Failure to comply with certain covenants, including the financial covenant, if not cured or waived, will result in an event of default that could trigger acceleration of our indebtedness, which would require us to repay all amounts owed and could have a material adverse impact on our business. In addition, our Credit Facility has a floating interest rate that is based on variable and unpredictable U.S. and international economic risks and uncertainties. If we were to draw on the Credit Facility, any increase in interest rates, as has occurred in the past and may occur in the future, may negatively impact our financial results. 
 We continue to have the ability to incur additional debt, subject to the limitations in our Credit Facility and the indentures governing our Senior Notes. Our level of debt could have important consequences to us, including the following: 
 our ability to obtain additional financing, if necessary, for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other purposes may be impaired or such financing may not be available on favorable terms; 
 we may need a substantial portion of our cash flow to make principal and interest payments on our debt, reducing the funds that would otherwise be available for investment in operations and future business opportunities; 
 our debt level will make us more vulnerable than our competitors with less debt to competitive pressures or a downturn in our business or the economy generally; and 
 our debt level may limit our flexibility in responding to changing business and economic conditions. 
 Our ability to service our debt will depend upon, among other things, our future financial and operating performance, which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions and financial, business, regulatory and other factors, some of which are beyond our control. If our operating results are not sufficient to service our current or future indebtedness, we will be forced to take actions such as reducing or delaying our business activities, acquisitions, investments or capital expenditures, selling assets, restructuring or refinancing our debt, or seeking additional equity capital or bankruptcy protection. We may not be able to effect any of these remedies on satisfactory terms to us or at all. 
 We are subject to risks associated with our strategic investments, including partial or complete loss of invested capital. Significant changes in the value of this portfolio could negatively impact our financial results. 
 We have strategic investments in privately held companies, and, in the past, publicly traded companies, in both domestic and international markets, including in emerging markets. These companies range from early-stage companies to more mature companies with established revenue streams and business models. Many such companies generate net losses and the market for their products, services or technologies may be slow to develop, and, therefore, they are dependent on the availability of later rounds of financing from banks or investors on favorable terms to continue their operations. The financial success of our investment in any privately held company is typically dependent on a liquidity event, such as a public offering, acquisition or other favorable market event reflecting appreciation relative to the cost of our initial investment. Likewise, the financial success of our investment in any publicly held company is typically dependent upon an exit in favorable market conditions, and to a lesser extent on liquidity events. The capital markets for public offerings and acquisitions are dynamic and the likelihood of successful liquidity events for the companies we have invested in could significantly worsen. 
 Privately held companies in which we invest have undertaken in the past and others may in the future undertake, an initial public offering. We may also decide to invest in companies in connection with or as part of such company s initial public offering or other transactions directly or indirectly resulting in it being publicly traded. 
 56 

Therefore, our investment strategy and portfolio have also expanded in the past to include public companies. In certain cases, our ability to sell these investments may be constrained by contractual obligations to hold the securities for a period of time after a public offering, including market standoff agreements and lock-up agreements. 
 All of our investments, especially our investments in privately held companies, are subject to a risk of a partial or total loss of investment capital and a number of our investments have lost value in the past. Valuations of privately held companies are also inherently complex due to the lack of readily available market data, and, as a result, the basis for these valuations is subject to the timing and accuracy of the data received from these companies. If we determine that any of our more significant investments have experienced a decline in value, we may be required to record an impairment, which could be material and negatively impact our financial results. In addition, we have in the past, and may in the future, continue to deploy material investments in individual companies in which we have previously invested, resulting in the increasing concentration of risk in a small number of companies. Partial or complete loss of investment capital of these individual companies could be material to our financial statements. 
 Our global operations and structure subject us to potentially adverse tax consequences. 
 We are subject to income taxes as well as non-income-based taxes in the U.S., Australia and various other jurisdictions. Significant judgment is often required in the determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes. Our effective tax rate could be impacted by changes in our earnings and losses in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in transfer pricing, changes in operations, changes in nondeductible expenses, changes in excess tax benefits of stock-based compensation expense, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and our ability to utilize them, the applicability of withholding taxes, effects from acquisitions, and changes in accounting principles and tax laws. Any changes or uncertainty in taxing jurisdictions administrative interpretations, decisions, policies and positions could also materially impact our income tax liabilities. Our intercompany relationships are subject to complex transfer pricing regulations administered by taxing authorities in various jurisdictions. The relevant revenue and taxing authorities may disagree with positions we have taken generally, or our determinations as to the value of assets sold or acquired, or income and expenses attributable to specific jurisdictions. For example, during fiscal year 2024, we entered into a unilateral advanced pricing arrangement with the Australian Tax Office in relation to our transfer pricing arrangements between Australia and the U.S. for the tax years ended June 30, 2019 to June 30, 2025 that resulted in us making a tax payment of 117.4 million. We will continue to pursue advanced pricing arrangements in Australia and other jurisdictions to proactively manage and mitigate the risk of transfer pricing disputes with tax authorities. In addition, in the ordinary course of our business we are subject to tax audits from various taxing authorities. Although we believe our tax positions are appropriate, the final determination of any future tax audits could be materially different from our income tax provisions, accruals and reserves. If such a disagreement were to occur, we could be required to pay additional taxes, interest and penalties, which could result in one-time tax charges, a higher effective tax rate, reduced cash flows and lower overall profitability of our operations. 
 Tax laws in the U.S. and in foreign jurisdictions are subject to change. For example, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act TCJA ), signed into law in 2017, enacted significant tax law changes which impacted our tax obligations and effective tax rate beginning in our fiscal year 2023. The TCJA eliminates the option to deduct research and development expenditures, instead requiring taxpayers to capitalize and amortize such expenditures over five or fifteen years beginning in fiscal year 2023. Although Congress is considering legislation that would defer or eliminate the capitalization and amortization requirement, there is no assurance as to whether the provision will be repealed or otherwise modified or whether any change would apply retroactively or prospectively. The Inflation Reduction Act IRA ), signed into law in 2022, includes various corporate tax provisions including a new alternative corporate minimum tax on applicable corporations. The IRA tax provisions may become applicable to us in future years, which could result in additional taxes, a higher effective tax rate, reduced cash flows and lower overall profitability of our operations. 
 Certain government agencies in jurisdictions where we do business have had an extended focus on issues related to the taxation of multinational companies. In addition, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (the OECD has introduced various guidelines changing the way tax is assessed, collected and governed. Of note are the efforts around base erosion and profit shifting which seek to establish certain international standards for taxing the worldwide income of multinational companies. These measures have been endorsed by the leaders of the world s 20 largest economies. 
 In March 2018, the EC proposed a series of measures aimed at ensuring a fair and efficient taxation of digital businesses operating within the EU. As collaborative efforts by the OECD and EC continue, some countries have unilaterally moved to introduce their own digital service tax or equalization levy to capture tax revenue on digital

services more immediately. Notably France, Italy, Austria, Spain, the UK and Turkey have enacted this tax, generally 2 on specific in-scope sales above a revenue threshold. The EU and the UK have established a mandate that focuses on the transparency of cross-border arrangements concerning at least one EU member state through mandatory disclosure and exchange of cross-border arrangements rules. The mandate is further extended to include certain domestic arrangements in Poland. These regulations (known as MDR in the UK and Poland and DAC 6 in the other EU countries) require taxpayers to disclose certain transactions to the tax authorities resulting in an additional layer of compliance and require careful consideration of the tax benefits obtained when entering into transactions that need to be disclosed. 
 The OECD introduced significant changes to the international tax law framework through the Pillar Two guidelines. The framework outlines a coordinated set of rules to prevent multinational enterprises from shifting profits to low-tax jurisdictions by implementing a 15 global minimum tax. Many countries in which we operate, including the member states of the EU, have enacted Pillar Two. Pillar Two rules will apply to us beginning in this fiscal year 2025. The potential effects of Pillar Two may vary depending on the specific provisions and rules implemented by each country that adopts Pillar Two and may include tax rate changes, higher effective tax rates, potential tax disputes and adverse impacts to our cash flows, tax liabilities, results of operations and financial position 
 Global tax developments applicable to multinational companies may continue to result in new tax regimes or changes to existing tax laws, regulations and taxation officer interpretations. If the U.S. or foreign taxing authorities change tax laws, our overall taxes could increase, lead to a higher effective tax rate, harm our cash flows, results of operations and financial position. 
 Taxing authorities may successfully assert that we should have collected or in the future should collect sales and use, value-added or similar taxes, and we could be subject to liability with respect to past or future sales, which could harm our results of operations. 
 We do not collect sales and use, value-added and similar taxes in all jurisdictions in which we have sales, based on our understanding that such taxes are not applicable to the products we sell in certain jurisdictions. Sales and use, value-added and similar tax laws and rates vary greatly by jurisdiction. Certain jurisdictions in which we do not collect such taxes may assert that such taxes are applicable, which could result in tax assessments, penalties, and interest, and we may be required to collect such taxes in the future. Such tax assessments, penalties and interest, or future requirements could harm our results of operations. 
 If we are unable to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting in the future, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and the market price of our Class A Common Stock could be negatively affected. 
 As a public company, we are required to maintain internal controls over financial reporting and to report any material weaknesses in such internal controls. We are required to furnish a report by management on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act Section 404 ). If we identify material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, if we are unable to comply with the requirements of Section 404 in a timely manner or assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to express an opinion as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and the market price of Class A Common Stock could be negatively affected. We could also become subject to investigations by the stock exchange on which our securities are listed, the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC or other regulatory authorities, which could require additional financial and management resources. 
 We may encounter difficulties in operating our upgraded enterprise resource planning system, which could materially adversely affect us. 
 During the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2023, we upgraded our enterprise resource planning ERP system to help us manage our operations and financial reporting. Our upgraded ERP system may not operate as we expect it to and could cause disruption to our operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. Difficulties that may occur in connection with operating our upgraded ERP system include disruptions to business continuity, administrative or technical problems, difficulty in maintaining effective internal controls, and interruptions or delays to our sales processes. Any of these events could damage our reputation and harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.

We face exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. 
 While we primarily sell our products in U.S. dollars, we incur expenses in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, which exposes us to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. A large percentage of our expenses are denominated in the Australian dollar and the Indian rupee, and fluctuations in these currencies could have a material negative impact on our results of operations. Moreover, our subsidiaries, other than our U.S. subsidiaries, maintain net assets that are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. In addition, we transact in non-U.S. dollar currencies for our products, and, accordingly, changes in the value of non-U.S. dollar currencies relative to the U.S. dollar could affect our revenue and results of operations due to transactional and translational remeasurements that are reflected in our results of operations. 
 We have a foreign exchange hedging program to hedge a portion of certain exposures to fluctuations in non-U.S. dollar currency exchange rates. We use derivative instruments, such as foreign currency forward contracts, to hedge the exposures. The use of such hedging instruments may not fully offset the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign currency exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place. Moreover, the use of hedging instruments may introduce additional risks if we are unable to structure effective hedges with such instruments or if we are unable to forecast hedged exposures accurately. 
 We are exposed to credit risk and fluctuations in the market values of our investment portfolio. 
 Given the global nature of our business, we have diversified U.S. and non-U.S. investments. Credit ratings and pricing of our investments can be negatively affected by liquidity, credit deterioration, financial results, economic risk, including from impacts of inflation, recent geopolitical instability, political risk, sovereign risk or other factors. As a result, the value and liquidity of our investments may fluctuate substantially. Therefore, although we have not realized any significant losses on our investments, future fluctuations in their value could result in a significant realized loss. 
 If we are deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, our results of operations could be harmed. 
 Under Sections 3(a)(1)(A) and (C) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the Investment Company Act ), a company generally will be deemed to be an investment company for purposes of the Investment Company Act if (i) it is, or holds itself out as being, engaged primarily, or proposes to engage primarily, in the business of investing, reinvesting, or trading in securities or (ii) it engages, or proposes to engage, in the business of investing, reinvesting, owning, holding, or trading in securities and it owns or proposes to acquire investment securities having a value exceeding 40 of the value of its total assets (exclusive of U.S. government securities and cash items) on an unconsolidated basis. We do not believe that we are an investment company, as such term is defined in either of these sections of the Investment Company Act. We currently conduct, and intend to continue to conduct, our operations so that neither we, nor any of our subsidiaries, is required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. If we were obligated to register as an investment company, we would have to comply with a variety of substantive requirements under the Investment Company Act that impose, among other things, limitations on capital structure, restrictions on specified investments, prohibitions on transactions with affiliates, and compliance with reporting, record keeping, voting, proxy disclosure and other rules and regulations that would increase our operating and compliance costs, could make it impractical for us to continue our business as contemplated, and could harm our results of operations. 
 Risks Related to Legal and Regulatory Matters 
 The requirements of being a public company may strain our resources, divert management s attention, and affect our ability to attract and retain executive officers and qualified board members. 
 We are subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, the listing requirements of Nasdaq and other applicable securities rules and regulations. Compliance with these rules and regulations has increased our legal and financial compliance costs, making some activities more difficult, time-consuming, and costly, and has increased demand on our systems and resources. The Exchange Act requires, among other things, that we file annual reports with respect to our business and results of operations. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. In order to maintain and, if required, improve our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting to meet this standard, significant resources and management oversight is required. 
 59 

We have in the past and expect to continue to incur significant legal, accounting, insurance and other expenses and to expend time and resources to comply with these requirements. Additionally, as a result of the complexity involved in complying with the rules and regulations applicable to public companies, our management s attention may be diverted from other business concerns, which could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, the pressures of operating a public company may divert management s attention to delivering short-term results, instead of focusing on long-term strategy. Additionally, we may need to develop our reporting and compliance infrastructure and may face challenges in complying with new requirements that may become applicable to us over time. If we fall out of compliance, we risk becoming subject to litigation or being delisted, among other potential problems. 
 Further, as a public company it is more expensive for us to maintain adequate director and officer liability insurance, and we may be required to accept reduced coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain coverage. These factors could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified executive officers and members of our board of directors. 
 We and our customers are subject to increasing and changing laws and regulations that may expose us to liability and increase our costs. 
 Federal, state, local and foreign government bodies or agencies have in the past adopted, and may in the future adopt, laws or regulations affecting the technology industry or the industries in which our customers operate, including imposing taxes, fees, or other charges. Changes in these laws or regulations could require us to modify our products in order to comply with these changes. The costs of compliance with, and other burdens imposed by, industry-specific laws, regulations and interpretive positions may limit our customers use and adoption of our services and reduce overall demand for our services. Compliance with these regulations may also require us to devote greater resources to support certain customers, which may increase costs and lengthen sales cycles. For example, some financial services regulators in various jurisdictions have imposed guidelines for use of cloud computing services that mandate specific controls or require financial services enterprises to obtain regulatory approval prior to outsourcing certain functions. In the United States, the implementation of a cybersecurity Executive Order released in May 2021 may result in further changes and enhancements to compliance and incident reporting standards in order to obtain certain public sector contracts in the future. Additionally, in July 2023, the SEC adopted rules requiring the disclosure of specified elements of cybersecurity risk management, strategy and governance and requiring the disclosure of material cybersecurity incidents within a short time period. If we are unable to comply with these rules, guidelines or controls, or if our customers are unable to obtain regulatory approval to use our services where required, our business may be harmed. 
 Additionally, various of our products are subject to U.S. export controls, including the U.S. Department of Commerce s Export Administration Regulations and economic and trade sanctions regulations administered by the U.S. Treasury Department s Office of Foreign Assets Controls. These regulations may limit the export of our products and provision of our services outside of the U.S., or may require export authorizations, including by license, a license exception, or other appropriate government authorizations, including annual or semi-annual reporting and the filing of an encryption registration. Export control and economic sanctions laws may also include prohibitions on the sale or supply of certain of our products to embargoed or sanctioned countries, regions, governments, persons and entities. In addition, various countries regulate the importation of certain products through import permitting and licensing requirements, and have enacted laws that could limit our ability to distribute our products. Import, export and economic sanctions laws may also change rapidly due to political events, such as has occurred in response to Russia s invasion of Ukraine. The exportation, reexportation, and importation of our products, and the provision of services, including by our solution partners, must comply with these laws or else we may be adversely affected through reputational harm, government investigations, penalties, and a denial or curtailment of our ability to export our products or provide services. Complying with export control and sanctions laws can be time consuming and complex and may result in the delay or loss of sales opportunities. Although we take precautions to prevent our products from being provided in violation of such laws, we are aware of previous exports of certain of our products to a small number of persons and organizations that are the subject of U.S. sanctions or located in countries or regions subject to U.S. sanctions. If we are found to be in violation of U.S. sanctions or export control laws, it could result in substantial fines and penalties for us and for the individuals working for us. Changes in export or import laws or corresponding sanctions may delay the introduction and sale of our products in international markets, or, in some cases, prevent the export or import of our products to certain countries, regions, governments, persons or entities altogether, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Changes in import and export laws are occurring in the jurisdictions in which we operate and we may fail to comply with new or changing regulations in a timely manner, which could result in 
 60 

substantial fines and penalties for us and could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operation. 
 We are also subject to various domestic and international anti-corruption laws, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the UK Bribery Act, as well as other similar anti-bribery and anti-kickback laws and regulations. These laws and regulations generally prohibit companies and their employees and intermediaries from authorizing, offering, or providing improper payments or benefits to officials and other recipients for improper purposes. We rely on certain third parties to support our sales and regulatory compliance efforts and can be held liable for their corrupt or other illegal activities, even if we do not explicitly authorize or have actual knowledge of such activities. Although we take precautions to prevent violations of these laws, our exposure for violating these laws increases as our international presence expands and as we increase sales and operations in additional jurisdictions. 
 Finally, as we expand our products and services and evolve our business models, we may become subject to additional government regulation or increased regulatory scrutiny. Regulators (both in the U.S. and in other jurisdictions in which we operate) may adopt new laws or regulations, change existing regulations, or their interpretation of existing laws or regulations may differ from ours. For example, the regulation of emerging technologies that are incorporated into our offerings, such as AI and machine learning, is still an evolving area, and it is possible that we could become subject to new regulations that negatively impact our plans, operations and results. Additionally, many jurisdictions across the world are currently considering, or have already begun implementing, changes to antitrust and competition laws, regulations or their enforcement to enhance competition in digital markets and address practices by certain digital platforms that they perceive to be anticompetitive, which may impact our ability to invest in, acquire or enter into joint ventures with other entities. 
 New legislation, regulation, public policy considerations, changes in the cybersecurity environment, litigation by governments or private entities, changes to or new interpretations of existing laws may result in greater oversight of the technology industry, restrict the types of products and services that we can offer, limit how we can distribute our products, or otherwise cause us to change the way we operate our business. We may not be able to respond quickly to such regulatory, legislative and other developments, and these changes may in turn increase our cost of doing business and limit our revenue opportunities. In addition, if our practices are not consistent with new interpretations of existing laws, we may become subject to lawsuits, penalties, and other liabilities that did not previously apply. 
 Investors and other stakeholders expectations of our performance relating to environmental, social and governance factors may impose additional costs and expose us to new risks. 
 There is an increasing focus from certain investors, customers, employees, other stakeholders and regulators concerning environmental, social and governance matters ESG ). Some investors may use these non-financial performance factors to guide their investment strategies and, in some cases, may choose not to invest in us if they believe our policies and actions relating to ESG are inadequate. We may face reputational damage in the event that we do not meet the ESG standards set by various constituencies. 
 As ESG best practices and reporting standards continue to develop, we may incur increasing costs relating to ESG monitoring and reporting and complying with ESG initiatives. For example, in recent years, there has been a proliferation of climate and other ESG disclosure requirements at the local, national and international levels, which have required and may continue to require significant effort and resources in order to comply with differing requirements. We publish an annual Sustainability Report, which describes, among other things, the measurement of our greenhouse gas emissions and our efforts to reduce emissions. In addition, our Sustainability Report provides highlights of how we are supporting our workforce, including our efforts to promote diversity, equity, and inclusion. Our disclosures on these matters, or a failure to meet evolving stakeholder expectations for ESG practices and reporting, may potentially harm our reputation and customer relationships. Due to new regulatory standards and market standards, certain new or existing customers, particularly those in the European Union, may impose stricter ESG guidelines or mandates for, and may scrutinize relationships more closely with, their counterparties, including us, which may lengthen sales cycles or increase our costs. 
 Furthermore, if our competitors ESG performance is perceived to be better than ours, potential or current investors or other stakeholders may elect to engage with our competitors instead. In addition, in the event that we communicate certain initiatives or goals regarding ESG matters, we could fail, or be perceived to fail, in our achievement of such initiatives or goals, or we could be criticized for the scope of such initiatives or goals. If we fail to satisfy the expectations of investors, customers, employees and other stakeholders or our initiatives are not executed as planned, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects could be adversely 
 61 

affected. Alternatively, any negative perceptions of our pursuit of any ESG or diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives could also result in adverse impacts, including potential stakeholder engagement or litigation. 
 Risks Related to Ownership of Our Class A Common Stock 
 The dual class structure of our common stock has the effect of concentrating voting control with certain stockholders, in particular, our Co-Founders and their affiliates, which will limit our other stockholders ability to influence the outcome of important transactions, including a change in control. 
 Shares of our Class B Common Stock have ten votes per share and shares of our Class A Common Stock have one vote per share. As of September 30, 2024, stockholders who hold our Class B Common Stock collectively hold approximately 86 of the voting power of our outstanding share capital and in particular, entities affiliated with our Co-Founders, Michael Cannon-Brookes and Scott Farquhar, collectively hold approximately 86 of the voting power of our outstanding share capital. The holders of our Class B Common Stock will collectively continue to control a majority of the combined voting power of our capital stock and therefore be able to control substantially all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval so long as the outstanding shares of our Class B Common Stock represent at least 10 of all shares of our outstanding Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock in the aggregate. These holders of our Class B Common Stock may also have interests that differ from holders of our Class A Common Stock and may vote in a way which may be adverse to such interests. This concentrated control may have the effect of delaying, preventing or deterring a change in control of Atlassian, could deprive our stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their shares as part of a sale of Atlassian and might ultimately affect the market price of our Class A Common Stock. 
 If Messrs. Cannon-Brookes and Farquhar retain a significant portion of their holdings of our Class B Common Stock for an extended period of time, they will control a significant portion of the voting power of our capital stock for the foreseeable future. As members of our board of directors, Messrs. Cannon-Brookes and Farquhar each owe statutory and fiduciary duties to Atlassian and must act in good faith and in a manner they consider would be most likely to promote the success of Atlassian for the benefit of stockholders as a whole. As stockholders, Messrs. Cannon-Brookes and Farquhar are entitled to vote their shares in their own interests, which may not always be in the interests of our stockholders generally. 
 The market price of our Class A Common Stock is volatile, has fluctuated significantly in the past, and could continue to fluctuate significantly regardless of our operating performance resulting in substantial losses for the holders of our Class A Common Stock. 
 The trading price of our Class A Common Stock is volatile, has fluctuated significantly in the past, and could continue to fluctuate significantly, regardless of our operating performance, in response to numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control, including: 
 actual or anticipated fluctuations in our results of operations; 
 the financial projections we may provide to the public, any changes in these projections or our failure to meet these projections; 
 failure of securities analysts to initiate or maintain coverage of Atlassian, publication of inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, changes in financial estimates or ratings changes by any securities analysts who follow Atlassian or our failure to meet these estimates or the expectations of investors; 
 announcements by us or our competitors of significant technical innovations, new products, acquisitions, pricing changes, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments; 
 changes in operating performance and stock market valuations of other technology companies generally, or those in our industry in particular; 
 price and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market from time to time, including as a result of trends in the economy as a whole; 
 actual or anticipated developments in our business or our competitors businesses or the competitive landscape generally; 
 developments or disputes concerning our intellectual property or our products, or third-party proprietary rights; 
 62 

changes in accounting standards, policies, guidelines, interpretations or principles; 
 new laws or regulations, new interpretations of existing laws, or the new application of existing regulations to our business; 
 major changes to our board of directors or management; 
 additional shares of Class A Common Stock being sold into the market by us or our existing stockholders or the anticipation of such sales; 
 the existence of our Share Repurchase Programs (as defined below) and purchases made pursuant to the Share Repurchase Programs or any failure to repurchase shares as planned, including failure to meet expectations around the timing, price or amount of share repurchases, and any reduction, suspension or termination of the Share Repurchase Programs; 
 cyber-security and privacy breaches; 
 lawsuits threatened or filed against us; 
 general economic conditions and macroeconomic factors, such as inflationary pressures, recession or financial institution instability; and 
 other events or factors, including those resulting from geopolitical risks, natural disasters, climate change, diseases and pandemics, or incidents of terrorism or war, such as in the Middle East and Ukraine, as well as responses to any of these events 
 In addition, the stock markets, and in particular the market on which our Class A Common Stock is listed, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many technology companies. Stock prices of many technology companies have fluctuated in a manner unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. In the past, stockholders have instituted securities class action litigation following periods of market volatility. In February 2023, a purported securities class action complaint was filed against us and certain of our officers in U.S. federal court. This case has been dismissed but it is possible there could be other securities litigation in the future that subject us to substantial costs, divert resources and the attention of management from operating our business, and harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
 Substantial future sales of our common stock could cause the market price of our Class A Common Stock to decline. 
 The market price of our Class A Common Stock could decline as a result of substantial sales of shares of our Class A Common Stock, particularly sales by our directors, executive officers and significant stockholders, or the perception in the market that holders of a large number of shares intend to sell their shares. As of September 30, 2024, we had 160,713,952 outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock and 99,995,049 outstanding shares of convertible Class B Common Stock. We have also registered shares of Class A Common Stock that we issue under our employee equity incentive plans. These shares may be sold freely in the public market upon issuance. 
 We cannot guarantee that any Share Repurchase Program will be fully consummated or that it will enhance long-term stockholder value. Repurchases of shares of our Class A Common Stock could also increase the volatility of the trading price of our Class A Common Stock and could diminish our cash reserves. 
 In January 2023, our board of directors authorized a share repurchase program to repurchase up to 1.0 billion of our outstanding Class A Common Stock (the 2023 Share Repurchase Program ). In September 2024, our board of directors authorized a new program under which we may repurchase up to an additional 1.5 billion of our outstanding Class A Common Stock (the 2024 Share Repurchase Program, and together with the 2023 Share Repurchase Program, the Share Repurchase Programs ). The 2024 Share Repurchase Program will commence following completion of the 2023 Share Repurchase Program. Under the Share Repurchase Programs, stock repurchases may be made from time to time through open market purchases, in privately negotiated transactions, or by other means, including through the use of trading plans intended to qualify under Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act, in accordance with applicable securities laws and other restrictions. The Share Repurchase Program does not have a fixed expiration date, may be suspended or discontinued at any time, and does not obligate us to acquire any amount of Class A Common Stock. The timing, manner, price, and amount of any repurchases will be determined by us at our discretion and will depend on a variety of factors, including business, economic and market conditions, prevailing stock prices, corporate and regulatory requirements, and other considerations. We cannot 
 63 

guarantee that any Share Repurchase Program will be fully consummated or that it will enhance long-term stockholder value. The Share Repurchase Programs could also affect the trading price of our Class A Common Stock and increase volatility, and any announcement of a reduction, suspension or termination of the Share Repurchase Program may result in a decrease in the trading price of our Class A Common Stock. In addition, repurchasing our Class A Common Stock could diminish our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities available to fund working capital, repayment of debt, capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions, investments, or business opportunities, and other general corporate purposes. 
 We do not expect to declare dividends in the foreseeable future. 
 We currently anticipate that we will retain future earnings for the development, operation and expansion of our business and to fund our Share Repurchase Programs, and do not anticipate declaring or paying any cash dividends for the foreseeable future. As a result, stockholders must rely on sales of their shares of Class A Common Stock after price appreciation, if any, as the only way to realize any future gains on their investment. 
 Anti-takeover provisions contained in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, amended and restated bylaws, our Senior Notes, as well as provisions of Delaware law, could impair a takeover attempt. 
 Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain, and the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the Delaware General Corporation Law contains, provisions which could have the effect of rendering more difficult, delaying or preventing an acquisition deemed undesirable by our board of directors. These provisions provide for the following: 
 a dual-class structure which provides our holders of Class B Common Stock with the ability to significantly influence the outcome of matters requiring stockholder approval, even if they own significantly less than a majority of the shares of our outstanding Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock; 
 no cumulative voting in the election of directors, which limits the ability of minority stockholders to elect director candidates; 
 the exclusive right of our board of directors to set the size of the board of directors and to elect a director to fill a vacancy, however occurring, including by an expansion of the board of directors, which prevents stockholders from being able to fill vacancies on our board of directors; 
 the ability of our board of directors to authorize the issuance of shares of preferred stock and to determine the price and other terms of those shares, including voting or other rights or preferences, without stockholder approval, which could be used to significantly dilute the ownership of a hostile acquirer; 
 the ability of our board of directors to alter our amended and restated bylaws without obtaining stockholder approval; 
 in addition to our board of directors ability to adopt, amend, or repeal our amended and restated bylaws, our stockholders may adopt, amend, or repeal our amended and restated bylaws only with the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66 2/3 of the voting power of the outstanding shares of capital stock entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class; 
 the required approval of at least 66 2/3 of the voting power of the outstanding shares of capital stock entitled to vote thereon, voting together as a single class, to adopt, amend, or repeal certain provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation; 
 the ability of stockholders to act only at an annual or special meeting of stockholders; 
 the requirement that a special meeting of stockholders may be called only by certain specified officers of the Company, a majority of our board of directors then in office or the chairperson of our board of directors; 
 advance notice procedures that stockholders must comply with in order to nominate candidates to our board of directors or to propose matters to be acted upon at a stockholders meeting, which may discourage or deter a potential acquirer from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquirer s own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us; and 
 the limitation of liability of, and provision of indemnification to, our directors and officers. 
 These provisions, alone or together, could delay or prevent hostile takeovers and changes in control or changes in our management. 
 64 

In addition, the change in control repurchase event provisions of our Senior Notes may delay or prevent a change in control of the Company, because those provisions allow note holders to require us to repurchase such notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change or change in control repurchase event. As a Delaware corporation, we are also subject to provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law, including Section 203 thereof, which prevents some stockholders holding more than 15 of our outstanding common stock from engaging in certain business combinations without approval of the holders of substantially all of our outstanding common stock. Any provision of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, amended and restated bylaws, Senior Notes or the Delaware General Corporation Law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock, and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock. 
 Claims for indemnification by our directors and officers may reduce our available funds to satisfy successful third-party claims against us and may reduce the amount of money available to us. 
 Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws provide that we will indemnify our directors and officers, in each case to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law. 
 In addition, as permitted by Section 145 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, our amended and restated bylaws and our indemnification agreements that we have entered or intend to enter into with our directors and officers provide that: 
 we will indemnify our directors and officers to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law. Delaware law provides that a corporation may indemnify such person if such person acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the registrant and, with respect to any criminal proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe such person s conduct was unlawful; 
 we may, in our discretion, indemnify employees and agents in those circumstances where indemnification is permitted by applicable law; 
 we are required to advance expenses, as incurred, to our directors and officers in connection with defending a proceeding, except that such directors or officers will undertake to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such person is not entitled to indemnification; 
 the rights conferred in our amended and restated bylaws are not exclusive, and we are authorized to enter into indemnification agreements with our directors, officers, employees and agents and to obtain insurance to indemnify such persons, both of which we have done; and 
 we may not retroactively amend our amended and restated bylaw provisions to reduce our indemnification obligations to directors, officers, employees, and agents. 
 While we have procured directors and officers liability insurance policies, such insurance policies may not be available to us in the future at a reasonable rate, may not cover all potential claims for indemnification, and may not be adequate to indemnify us for all liability that may be imposed. 
 Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws provide for an exclusive forum in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware for certain disputes between us and our stockholders, and that the federal district courts of the United States will be the exclusive forum for the resolution of any complaint asserting a cause of action under the Securities Act. 
 Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws provide, that unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, (a) the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, if such court does not have subject matter jurisdiction thereof, the federal district court for the District of Delaware or other state courts of the State of Delaware) will, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be the sole and exclusive forum for: (i) any derivative action, suit or proceeding brought on behalf of the Company, (ii) any action, suit or proceeding asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director, officer or stockholder to the Company or our stockholders, (iii) any action, suit or proceeding arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law or our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or amended and restated bylaws, or (iv) any action, suit or proceeding asserting a claim against the Company that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine; and (b) the federal district courts of the United States will be the exclusive forum for the resolution of any complaint asserting a cause or causes of action arising under the Securities Act, including all causes of action asserted against any defendant to such complaint. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any 
 65 

interest in any security of the Company will be deemed to have notice of and consented to these provisions. Nothing in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or amended and restated bylaws precludes stockholders that assert claims under the Exchange Act, from bringing such claims in federal court to the extent that the Exchange Act confers exclusive federal jurisdiction over such claims, subject to applicable law. 
 We believe these provisions may benefit us by providing increased consistency in the application of Delaware law and federal securities laws by chancellors and judges, as applicable, particularly experienced in resolving corporate disputes, efficient administration of cases on a more expedited schedule relative to other forums and protection against the burdens of multi-forum litigation. If a court were to find the choice of forum provision that is contained in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or amended and restated bylaws to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. For example, Section 22 of the Securities Act creates concurrent jurisdiction for federal and state courts over all suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Securities Act or the rules and regulations thereunder. Accordingly, there is uncertainty as to whether a court would enforce such a forum selection provision as written in connection with claims arising under the Securities Act. 
 The choice of forum provisions may limit a stockholder s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or any of our current or former director, officer or stockholder to the Company, which may discourage such claims against us or any of our current or former director, officer or stockholder to the Company and result in increased costs for investors to bring a claim. 
 General Risk Factors 
 Our global operations subject us to risks that can harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition. 
 A key element of our strategy is to operate globally and sell our products to customers around the world. Operating globally requires significant resources and management attention and subjects us to regulatory, economic, geographic, and political risks. In particular, our global operations subject us to a variety of additional risks and challenges, including: 
 increased management, travel, infrastructure, and legal compliance costs associated with having operations in many countries; 
 difficulties in enforcing contracts, including clickwrap contracts that are entered into online, of which we have historically relied as part of our product licensing strategy, but which may be subject to additional legal uncertainty in some foreign jurisdictions; 
 increased financial accounting and reporting burdens and complexities; 
 requirements or preferences within other regions for domestic products, and difficulties in replacing products offered by more established or known regional competitors; 
 differing technical standards, existing or future regulatory and certification requirements, and required features and functionality; 
 communication and integration problems related to entering and serving new markets with different languages, cultures, and political systems; 
 compliance with foreign privacy and security laws and regulations and the risks and costs of non-compliance; 
 compliance with laws and regulations for foreign operations, including anti-bribery laws (such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.S. Travel Act, and the UK Bribery Act), import and export control laws, tariffs, trade barriers, economic sanctions, and other regulatory or contractual limitations on our ability to sell our products in certain foreign markets, and the risks and costs of non-compliance; 
 heightened risks of unfair or corrupt business practices in certain geographies that may impact our financial results and result in restatements of our consolidated financial statements; 
 fluctuations in currency exchange rates, interest rates, and related effects on our results of operations; 
 difficulties in repatriating or transferring funds from, or converting currencies in certain countries; 
 66 

weak economic conditions in any country or region in which we operate or sell our products, including due to rising inflation or hyperinflation, such as recently occurred in Turkey, and related interest rate increases, or general political and economic instability around the world, including in the Middle East and Ukraine; 
 differing labor standards, including restrictions related to, and the increased cost of, terminating employees in some countries; 
 difficulties in recruiting and hiring employees in certain countries; 
 the preference for localized software and licensing programs and localized language support; 
 reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries and practical difficulties associated with enforcing our legal rights abroad; 
 imposition of travel restrictions, modifications of employee work locations, or cancellation or reorganization of certain sales and marketing events as a result of pandemics or public health emergencies; 
 compliance with the laws of numerous foreign taxing jurisdictions, including withholding obligations, and overlapping of different tax regimes; and 
 geopolitical risks, such as political and economic instability, including in the U.S., and changes in diplomatic and trade relations. 
 Compliance with laws and regulations applicable to our global operations substantially increases our cost of doing business in foreign jurisdictions. We may be unable to keep current with changes in government requirements as they change from time to time. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could harm our business. In many countries, it is common for others to engage in business practices that are prohibited by our internal policies and procedures or other regulations applicable to us. Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these regulations and policies, there can be no assurance that all of our employees, contractors, business partners and agents will comply with these regulations and policies. Violations of laws, regulations or key control policies by our employees, contractors, business partners, or agents could result in delays in revenue recognition, financial reporting misstatements, enforcement actions, reputational harm, disgorgement of profits, fines, civil and criminal penalties, damages, injunctions, other collateral consequences, or the prohibition of the importation or exportation of our products and could harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition. 
 We depend on our executive officers and other key employees and the loss of one or more of these employees or the inability to attract and retain highly skilled employees could harm our business. 
 Our success depends largely upon the continued services of our executive officers and key employees. We rely on our leadership team and other key employees in the areas of research and development, products, strategy, operations, security, go-to-market, marketing, IT, support, and general and administrative functions. From time to time, there may be changes in our executive management team resulting from the hiring or departure of executives, which could disrupt our business. For example, one of our former Co-Chief Executive Officers stepped down from his executive officer role and into an advisory role, effective August 31, 2024, and our former Chief Sales Officer stepped down from his role, effective August 31, 2024. We do not have employment agreements with our executive officers or other key personnel that require them to continue to work for us for any specified period and, therefore, they are able to terminate their employment with us at any time. The loss of one or more of our executive officers, especially our Chief Executive Officer, or other key employees may harm our business. 
 In addition, in order to execute our growth plan, we must attract and retain highly qualified personnel. Competition for these personnel is intense, and many of the companies with which we compete for experienced personnel have greater resources than we have. We have from time to time experienced, and we expect to continue to experience, difficulty hiring and retaining employees with appropriate qualifications. In particular, recruiting and hiring senior product engineering personnel, especially those with experience in designing and developing software and cloud-based services or with AI and machine learning backgrounds, has been, and we expect it to continue to be, challenging. If we are unable to hire and retain talented product engineering personnel, we may be unable to scale our operations or release new products in a timely fashion and, as a result, customer satisfaction with our products may decline. Furthermore, as we hire employees from competitors or other companies, prior employers may attempt to assert that the employees or we have breached certain legal obligations, resulting in a diversion of our time and resources. 
 67 

Any reorganizational efforts we conduct, such as our March 2023 rebalancing to improve operational efficiencies and operating costs, may have an adverse effect on our ability to attract and retain employees. In addition, job candidates and existing employees often consider the value of the equity awards they receive in connection with their employment. We have experienced large fluctuations in our stock price since the end of fiscal year 2021. If the value or perceived value of our equity awards declines, it could harm our ability to recruit and retain highly skilled employees. If we fail to attract new personnel or fail to retain and motivate our current personnel, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be harmed. 
 Catastrophic events may disrupt our business. 
 Natural disasters, pandemics other public health emergencies, geopolitical conflicts, social or political unrest, or other catastrophic events may cause damage or disruption to our operations, international commerce and the global economy, and thus could harm our business. We have a large employee presence and operations in Australia and the San Francisco Bay Area of California. Australia has experienced significant wildfires and flooding that have impacted our employees. The west coast of the United States contains active earthquake zones and is often at risk from wildfires. In the event of a major earthquake, hurricane, typhoon or catastrophic event such as fire, power loss, telecommunications failure, cyber-attack, war or terrorist attack in any of the regions or localities in which we operate, we may be unable to continue our operations and may endure system interruptions, reputational harm, delays in our application development, lengthy interruptions in our product availability, breaches of data security and loss of critical data, all of which could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
 Additionally, we rely on our network and suppliers of third-party infrastructure and applications, internal technology systems, and our websites for our development, marketing, internal controls, operational support, hosted services and sales activities. If these systems were to fail or be negatively impacted as a result of a malfunction, natural disaster, disease or pandemic, or catastrophic event, our ability to conduct normal business operations and deliver products to our customers could be impaired. 
 As we grow our business, the need for business continuity planning and disaster recovery plans will grow in significance. If we are unable to develop adequate plans to ensure that our business functions continue to operate during and after a disaster, disease or pandemic, or catastrophic event, or if we are unable to successfully execute on those plans, our business and reputation could be harmed. 
 Climate change may have a long-term impact on our business. 
 The long-term effects of climate change on the global economy and the technology industry in particular are unclear; however, we recognize that there are inherent climate related risks wherever business is conducted. Climate-related events, including but not limited to the increasing frequency of extreme weather events and their impact on critical infrastructure in the U.S., Australia and elsewhere, have the potential to disrupt our business, our employees, our third-party suppliers, and/or the business of our customers, and may cause us to experience extended product downtimes, higher attrition, and losses and additional costs to maintain and resume operations. Furthermore, failure to achieve or advance towards our public sustainability commitments and objectives regarding climate action may have an adverse effect on our standing with investors, suppliers, and customers, as well as on our financial results and our capacity to attract and retain skilled individuals. In addition, any negative perceptions of our pursuit of climate action sustainability initiatives could also result in adverse impacts, including potential stakeholder engagement or litigation.

The timing, manner, price, and amount of any repurchases will be determined by us at our discretion and will depend on a variety of factors, including business, economic and market conditions, prevailing stock prices, corporate and regulatory requirements, and other considerations.
