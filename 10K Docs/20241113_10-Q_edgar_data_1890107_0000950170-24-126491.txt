CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 
 This Quarterly Report, including Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, contains forward-looking statements that involve substantial known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors. Undue reliance should not be placed on such statements. These forward-looking statements are not historical facts, but rather are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about our company, our current and prospective portfolio investments, our industry, our beliefs and our assumptions. Words such as anticipates, expects, intends, plans, will, may, continue, believes, seeks, estimates, would, could, should, targets, projects, and variations of these words and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements, although not all forward-looking statements include these words. 
 
 These statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors, some of which are beyond our control and difficult to predict and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or forecasted in the forward-looking statements. In addition to factors previously identified in the Item 1A. Risk Factors section of our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission SEC on March 29, 2024, as well as the risk factors set forth in Risk Factors of our Pre-Effective Registration Statement on Form N-2 filed on June 4, 2024, the following factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ materially from forward-looking statements or historical performance: 
 our, or our portfolio companies , future business, operations, operating results or prospects; 

changes in political, economic or industry conditions, the interest rate environment, inflationary concerns, financial and capital markets, and other external factors, including pandemic-related or other widespread health crises, inflation, supply chain disruptions, instability in the banking system, and the conflicts between Russia and Ukraine and Israel and Hamas, which could result in changes in the value of our assets; 

our business prospects and the prospects of the companies in which we may invest; 

the impact of increased competition and the investments that we expect to make; 

our ability to raise sufficient capital to execute our investment strategy; 

the ability of our portfolio companies to achieve their objectives; 

our current and expected financing arrangements and investments; 

changes in the general interest rate environment; 

the decommissioning of the London InterBank Offered Rate and use of alternative reference rates, such as the Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR 

the adequacy of our cash resources, financing sources and working capital; 

the timing and amount of cash flows, distributions and dividends, if any, from our portfolio companies; 

our contractual arrangements and relationships with third parties; 

actual and potential conflicts of interest with First Eagle Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiaries and affiliated entities (collectively, First Eagle ), the Adviser (as defined herein), the Subadviser (as defined herein), their affiliates, and their investment teams; 

the dependence of our future success on the general economy and its effect on the industries in which we may invest; 

our use of financial leverage; 

the timing, form, amount, or our ability to make distributions; 

the ability of the Adviser and the Subadviser to locate suitable investments for us and to monitor and administer our investments; 

the ability of the Adviser, the Subadviser or their affiliates to attract and retain highly talented professionals; 

our ability to qualify and maintain our qualification as a business development company BDC and as a regulated investment company RIC under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code 

the impact on our business of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, as amended, and the rules and regulations issued thereunder; 

1 

the impact of changes in laws or regulations (including the interpretation thereof), including tax laws, governing our operations or the operations of our portfolio companies or the operations of our competitors; 

the effect of changes to tax legislation and our tax position; 

the tax status of the enterprises in which we may invest; 

an economic downturn and the time period required for robust economic recovery therefrom, which will likely have a material impact on our portfolio companies results of operations and financial condition for its duration, which could lead to the loss of some or all of our investments in such portfolio companies and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition; 

upon entry into an agreement with a lender, a contraction of available credit and/or an inability to access capital markets or additional sources of liquidity could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition and impair our lending and investment activities; 

interest rate volatility could adversely affect our results, particularly given that we use leverage as part of our investment strategy; 

currency fluctuations could adversely affect the results of our investments in foreign companies, particularly to the extent that we receive payments denominated in foreign currency rather than U.S. dollars; 

risks associated with possible disruption in our or our portfolio companies operations due to wars and other forms of conflict, terrorist acts, security operations and catastrophic events or natural disasters, such as fires, floods, earthquakes, tornadoes, hurricanes and global health epidemics; 

the impact of information technology system failures, data security breaches, data privacy compliance, network disruptions, and cybersecurity attacks; and 

the risks, uncertainties and other factors we identify in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K , as well as our Pre-Effective Registration Statement on Form N-2 filed with the SEC on March 29, 2024 and June 4, 2024, respectively, and in our other filings with the SEC that we make from time to time. 

Although we believe that the assumptions on which these forward-looking statements are based are reasonable, any of the assumptions could prove to be inaccurate, and as a result, the forward-looking statements based on those assumptions also could be inaccurate. In light of these and other uncertainties, the inclusion of a projection or forward-looking statement in this Quarterly Report should not be regarded as a representation by us that our plans and objectives will be achieved. These risks and uncertainties include those described or identified in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K , as well as our Pre-Effective Registration Statement on Form N-2 filed with the SEC on March 29, 2024 and June 4, 2024, respectively. You should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which apply only as of the date of this prospectus or any prospectus supplement or other information incorporated herein by reference, as applicable. Moreover, we assume no duty and do not undertake to update the forward-looking statements and projections contained in this Quarterly Report, except as required by applicable law. 
 
 Because we are an investment company, the forward-looking statements and projections contained in this Quarterly Report are excluded from the safe harbor protection provided by Section 27A of the Securities Act and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ).

 of its total assets (net assets plus borrowings for investment purposes) in private credit investments (loans and other credit instruments that are issued in private offerings or issued by private U.S. or non-U.S. companies). This policy may be changed by the Board, and with at least 60 days prior notice to shareholders, upon the completion of the Fund's next repurchase offer (so long as such repurchase offer is not oversubscribed). To a lesser extent, the Company will also invest in broadly syndicated loans of publicly traded issuers, publicly traded high yield bonds and equity securities. The Company expects that investments in broadly syndicated loans and high yield bonds will generally be more liquid than other Private Credit assets and will likely be used to initially deploy capital upon receipt of subscriptions and may also be used for the purposes of maintaining and managing liquidity for its share repurchase program and cash management, while also presenting an opportunity for attractive investment returns. The Company is offering and selling its common shares of beneficial interest, par value per share (the Common Shares in a continuous private placement (the Private Offering in the United States under the exemption provided by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ), and Regulation D promulgated thereunder. The Company has registered a public offering with the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC to sell up to billion of Common Shares, on a continuous basis, but will not commence a public offering until such offering has been registered in all of the necessary U.S. states and territories. Additionally, the Company has applied to the SEC for exemptive relief to permit the Company to offer multiple classes of Common Shares in the public offering. The Company commenced its loan origination process and investment activities contemporaneously with the initial closing (excluding the initial seed capital investment made by the Adviser) (the Initial Closing of the Private Offering on June 12, 2023 and commenced operations following its first capital call on July 10, 2023 Commencement of Operations ). Prior to the Initial Closing, on April 28, 2023, the Adviser purchased Common Shares at per share.

The Company will cease accruing PIK interest if there is insufficient value to support the accrual or if the Company does not expect amounts to be collectible and will generally only begin to recognize PIK income again when all principal and interest have been paid or upon the restructuring of the investment where the interest is deemed collectible. To maintain the Company s status as a RIC, PIK interest income, which is considered investment company taxable income, may be required to be paid out to shareholders in the form of dividends even though the Company has not yet collected the cash. Amounts necessary to pay these dividends may come from available cash. The Company did not have any PIK investments during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. During the three months ended September 30, 2023 and the period April 28, 2023 (initial capitalization) through September 30, 2023, the Company did not have any PIK investments. Dividend Income Dividend income from cash equivalents is recorded on the record date. Dividend income on preferred equity investments is recorded on an accrual basis to the extent that such amounts are payable by the portfolio company and are expected to be collected. Dividend income on common equity investments is recorded on the record date for private portfolio companies and on the ex-dividend date for publicly traded portfolio companies. Distributions received from a limited liability company or limited partnership investment are evaluated to determine if the distribution should be recorded as dividend income or a return of capital. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company had and , respectively, of dividend income. During both the three months ended September 30, 2023 and the period April 28, 2023 (initial capitalization) through September 30, 2023, the Company had of dividend income. Other Income The Company may also generate revenue in the form of structuring, arranger or due diligence fees, amendment or consent fees, portfolio company administration fees, fees for providing significant managerial assistance and consulting fees. Such fees are recognized as income when earned or the services are rendered. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company had and , respectively, of other income. During both the three months ended September 30, 2023 and the period April 28, 2023 (initial capitalization) through September 30, 2023, the Company had of other income. Non-Accrual Loans are placed on non-accrual status when there is reasonable doubt whether principal or interest payments will be collected in full. The Company records the reversal of any previously accrued income against the same income category reflected in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. Additionally, any original issue discount OID and market discount are longer accreted to interest income as of the date the loan is placed on non-accrual status. Interest payments received on non-accrual loans may be recognized as income or applied to principal depending upon management s judgment regarding collectability. Non-accrual loans are restored to accrual status when past due principal and interest is paid current and, in management s judgment, are likely to remain current. However, the Company may make exceptions to this policy if the loan has sufficient collateral value and is in the process of collection. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , the Company had loans on non-accrual status.

of the sum of (i) its investment company taxable income, as defined by the Code but determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid, and (ii) its net tax-exempt income for such taxable year. In addition, based on the excise tax distribution requirements, the Company is subject to a nondeductible federal excise tax on undistributed earnings unless the Company distributes in a timely manner in each calendar year an amount at least equal to the sum of (1) of its ordinary income for the calendar year, (2) of its capital gain net income (both long-term and short-term, and adjusted for certain ordinary losses) for the one-year period generally ending October 31 of that calendar year and (3) any income realized, but not distributed, in prior years. For this purpose, however, any ordinary income or capital gain net income retained by the Company that is subject to corporate income tax is considered to have been distributed. Although the Company currently intends to make the required distributions to avoid the application of the U.S. federal excise tax, the Company may also decide to retain taxable income in excess of current year dividend distributions and to pay any applicable excise tax on such undistributed income.

of the value of the Company s net assets as of the beginning of the first business day of the applicable month. For services rendered under the Advisory Agreement, the management fee is payable monthly in arrears. Management fees that are payable under the Advisory Agreement for any partial period will be appropriately prorated. For these purposes, net assets means the Company s total assets less liabilities determined on a consolidated basis in accordance with GAAP. For the first calendar month in which the Company had operations, net assets were measured as the beginning net assets as of the Initial Closing. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company accrued and , respectively, in base management fees, which were fully waived (see Fee Waiver below). For both the three months ended September 30, 2023 and the period April 28, 2023 (initial capitalization) through September 30, 2023, the Company had in base management fees, which were fully waived. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , there were amounts payable to the Adviser relating to management fees. Incentive Fees The incentive fee consists of two components that are independent of each other, with the result that one component may be payable even if the other is not. A portion of the incentive fee is based on a percentage of income and a portion is based on a percentage of capital gains, each as described below: (i) Incentive Fee Based on Income 

 The portion based on our income is based on Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns. Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns means, as the context requires, either the dollar value of, or percentage rate of return on the value of our net assets at the end of the immediately preceding quarter from, interest income, dividend income and any other income (including any other fees (other than fees for providing managerial assistance), such as commitment, origination, structuring, diligence and consulting fees or other fees that we receive from portfolio companies) accrued during the calendar quarter, minus our operating expenses accrued for the quarter (including the management fee, expenses payable under the Administration Agreement entered into between us and the Administrator, and any interest expense or fees on any credit facilities or outstanding debt and dividends paid on any issued and outstanding preferred shares, but excluding the incentive fee and any shareholder servicing and/or distribution fees). Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns include, in the case of investments with a deferred interest feature (such as OID, debt instruments with PIK interest and zero coupon securities), accrued income that the Company has not yet received in cash. Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns do not include any realized capital gains, realized capital losses or unrealized capital appreciation or depreciation. The impact of expense support payments and recoupments are also excluded from Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns. Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns, expressed as a rate of return on the value of our net assets at the end of the immediately preceding quarter, is compared to a hurdle rate of return of per quarter annualized). Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns are calculated on a quarterly basis with no look-back period. The Company will pay the Adviser an incentive fee quarterly in arrears with respect to our Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns in each calendar quarter as follows: No incentive fee based on Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns in any calendar quarter in which our Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns do not exceed the hurdle rate of per quarter annualized); 

 annualized). The Company refers to this portion of our Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns (which exceeds the hurdle rate but is less than as the catch-up. The catch-up is meant to provide the Adviser with approximately of our Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns as if a hurdle rate did not apply if this net investment income exceeds in any calendar quarter; and 

 of the dollar amount of our Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns, if any, that exceed a rate of return of 1.43 annualized). This reflects that once the hurdle rate is reached and the catch-up is achieved, of all Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns thereafter are allocated to the Adviser. 

24 

and , respectively, in income-based incentive fees, which were fully waived (see Fee Waiver below). For both the three months ended September 30, 2023 and the period April 28, 2023 (initial capitalization) through September 30, 2023, the Company had no income-based incentive fees. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there were no amounts payable to the Adviser relating to income-based incentive fees. (ii) Incentive Fee on Capital Gains 

 The second component of the incentive fee, the capital gains incentive fee, is payable at the end of each calendar year in arrears. The amount payable equals of cumulative realized capital gains from inception through the end of such calendar year, computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation on a cumulative basis, less the aggregate amount of any previously paid incentive fee on capital gains as calculated in accordance with GAAP. Under GAAP, the Company includes unrealized gains in the calculation of capital gains incentive fee expense. This accrual reflects the incentive fees that would be payable to the Adviser if the Company s entire portfolio was liquidated at its fair value as of the balance sheet date even though the Adviser is not entitled to an incentive fee with respect to unrealized gains unless and until such gains are actually realized. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company accrued and , respectively, in capital gains incentive fees, which were fully waived (see Fee Waiver below). For both the three months ended September 30, 2023 and the period April 28, 2023 (initial capitalization) through September 30, 2023, the Company had no capital gains incentive fees. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there were no amounts payable to the Adviser relating to capital gain incentive fees. Fee Waiver For the twelve months following the Commencement of Operations, the Advisers have agreed to waive all management fees (including incentive fees) and subadvisory fees payable to them under the Advisory Agreement and Subadvisory Agreement (the Advisory Fee Waiver ). In connection with the effectiveness of the Company's registration statement, the Advisers have agreed to extend all management fee waivers (including the waiver of incentive fees) and subadvisory fees payable to them through December 31, 2024. The Advisory Fee Waiver is not revocable during its term and amounts waived pursuant to the Advisory Fee Waiver will not be subject to any right of future recoupment in favor of FEIM and FEAC.

For both the three months ended September 30, 2023 and the period April 28, 2023 (initial capitalization) through September 30, 2023, the Company incurred administrator expenses of . As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, and , respectively, of administrator expenses were due to the Administrator, which were included in accrued administrator expenses on the Consolidated Statement of Assets and Liabilities. Additionally, as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, and , respectively, were due to the Administrator for direct expenses paid on the Company s behalf, which were included in due to affiliates on the Consolidated Statement of Assets and Liabilities. Expense Support and Conditional Reimbursement Agreement On April 15, 2024, the Company's Board unanimously approved an Expense Support and Conditional Reimbursement Agreement (the Expense Support Agreement with the Adviser which became effective on June 6, 2024. The initial term of the Expense Support Agreement is 12 months. Under the Expense Support Agreement, the Adviser will advance all of the Company's Other Operating Expenses (as defined below) so such expenses do not exceed (on an annualized basis) of the Company's NAV Required Expense Payment ). Any Required Expense Payment must be paid by the Adviser to the Company in any combination of cash or other immediately available funds and/or offset against amounts due from the Company to the Adviser or its affiliates. Other Operating Expenses means the Company's organization and offering expenses, professional fees (including accounting, legal and auditing fees), custodian and transfer agent fees, third party valuation service fees, insurance costs, trustee fees, administration fees and other general and administrative expenses. For the avoidance of doubt, Other Operating Expenses excludes: (i) base management fees, (ii) incentive fees, (iii) shareholder servicing and/or distribution fees, (iv) brokerage costs or other investment-related out-of-pocket expenses, (v) dividend/interest payments (including any dividend payments, interest expense, commitment fees, or other expenses related to any leverage incurred by the Company), (vi) taxes, and (vii) extraordinary expenses (as determined in the sole discretion of the Adviser). Additionally, pursuant to the Expense Support Agreement, the Adviser may elect to pay, at such times as the Adviser determines, certain additional expenses on the Company's behalf (each such payment, a Voluntary Expense Payment and together with a Required Expense Payment, the Expense Payments ), provided that no portion of the payment will be used to pay any interest expense or shareholder servicing and/or distribution fees of the Company. Any Voluntary Expense Payment that the Adviser has committed to pay must be paid by the Adviser to the Company in any combination of cash or other immediately available funds no later than 45 days after such commitment was made in writing, and/or offset against amounts due from the Company to the Adviser or its affiliates. Following any calendar month (the "Applicable Calendar Month") in which Available Operating Funds (as defined below) exceed the cumulative distributions accrued to the Company's shareholders based on distributions declared with respect to record dates occurring in the Applicable Calendar Month Excess Operating Funds ), the Company will pay such Excess Operating Funds, or a portion thereof, to the Adviser until such time as all Expense Payments made by the Adviser to or on behalf of the Company within three years prior to the last business day of the Applicable Calendar Month have been reimbursed Reimbursement Payment ). Available Operating Funds means the sum of (i) the Company's net investment company taxable income (including net short-term capital gains reduced by net long-term capital losses), (ii) the Company's net capital gains (including the excess of net long-term capital gains over net short-term capital losses) and (iii) dividends and other distributions paid to the Company on account of investments in portfolio companies (to the extent such amounts listed in clause (iii) are not included under clauses (i) and (ii) above). 

 26 

of the Company's net asset value at the end of the Applicable Calendar Month. Effective Rate of Distributions Per Share means the annualized rate (based on a 365-day year) of regular cash distributions per share exclusive of returns of capital, distribution rate reductions due to distribution and shareholder servicing fees, and declared special dividends or special distributions, if any. The Company's obligation to make a Reimbursement Payment will automatically become a liability of the Company on the last business day of the Applicable Calendar Month, except to the extent the Adviser has waived its right to receive such payment for the Applicable Calendar Month.

 (2) in first lien senior secured debt for which the Valuation Designee did not develop the unobservable inputs for the determination of fair value (examples include insufficient liquidity and single source quotation). 

The significant unobservable input used in the fair value measurement of the Company s debt securities, excluding investments in asset-based loans, is the comparative yield which is used to discount the estimated future cash flows expected to be received from the underlying investment, which include both future principal and interest payments. In determining the comparative yield for the income approach, the Company considers current market yields and multiples, weighted average cost of capital, portfolio company performance, leverage levels, credit quality, among other factors, including U.S. federal tax rates, in its analysis. Significant increases (decreases) in the comparative yield in isolation would result in a significantly lower (higher) fair value measurement. The primary significant unobservable input used in the fair value measurement of the Company s investment in asset-based loans is the net realizable value of the underlying collateral of the loan. The Company considers information provided by the borrower in its compliance certificates and information from third party appraisals, among other factors, in its analysis. Significant increases (decreases) in the net realizable value of the underlying collateral would result in a significantly higher (lower) fair value measurement. Other Financial Assets and Liabilities As of September 30, 2024, the carrying amounts of the Company s other financial instruments, such as cash and cash equivalents, receivables and payables, approximate the fair value of such items due to the short maturity of such instruments. As of September 30, 2024, the carrying amount of the Company s outstanding Credit Facility approximates fair value. The fair value of the Credit Facility is estimated based upon market interest rates and entities with similar credit risk. As of September 30, 2024 , within the fair value hierarchy, the Company s cash equivalents would be categorized as Level 1 and the Company's outstanding Credit Facility would be categorized as Level 3.

The minimum utilization requirement increases to from September 22, 2024 through the end of the revolving period. Distributions from the SPV to the Company are limited by the terms of the Credit Facility, which generally allows for the distribution of net interest income quarterly pursuant to a waterfall during the reinvestment period. The SPV s obligations under the Credit Facility are secured by a first priority security interest in substantially all of the assets of the SPV, including its portfolio of investments, and the Company s equity interest in the SPV.

Character of Distributions The Company may fund its cash distributions to shareholders from any source of funds available to the Company, including but not limited to offering proceeds, net investment income from operations, and capital gains proceeds from the sale of assets. Sources of distributions, other than net investment income and realized gains on a GAAP basis, include required adjustments to GAAP net investment income in the current period to determine taxable income available for distributions.

Distribution Reinvestment The Company has adopted a dividend reinvestment plan DRP ), pursuant to which it reinvests all cash dividends declared by the Board on behalf of its shareholders who elected not to receive their dividends in cash. Shareholders who have opted into the Company s DRP will have their cash distributions automatically reinvested in additional shares as described below, rather than receiving the cash dividend or other distribution. A participating shareholder will receive an amount of shares equal to the amount of the distribution on that participant s shares divided by the most recent NAV per share that is available on the date such distribution was paid. Shareholders who receive distributions in the form of shares will generally be subject to the same U.S. federal, state and local tax consequences as if they received cash distributions; however, since their cash distributions will be reinvested, those shareholders will not receive cash with which to pay any applicable taxes. The Company intends to use newly issued shares to implement the plan. Common Shares issued under the dividend reinvestment plan will not reduce outstanding Capital Commitments. Share Repurchase Program Beginning with the calendar quarter ending December 31, 2024, the Company will commence a share repurchase program in which it intends to offer to repurchase in each quarter, at the discretion of the Board, up to of the Company s Common Shares outstanding (either by number of shares or aggregate NAV) as of the close of the last calendar day of the applicable quarter. The Board may amend or suspend the share repurchase program at any time if in its reasonable judgment it deems such action to be in the Company s best interest and the best interest of its shareholders. As a result, share repurchases may not be available each quarter, such as when a repurchase offer would place an undue burden on the Company s liquidity, adversely affect its operations or risk having an adverse impact on the Company that would outweigh the benefit of the repurchase offer. Following any such suspension, the Board intends to reinstate the share repurchase program when appropriate and subject to our Board s duties to the Company. The Company intends to conduct such repurchase offers in accordance with the requirements of Rule 13e-4 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), and the 1940 Act. All Common Shares purchased by us pursuant to the terms of each tender offer will be retired and thereafter will be authorized and unissued Common Shares. Under the Company s share repurchase program, to the extent the Company offers to repurchase Common Shares in any particular quarter, the Company expects to repurchase Common Shares pursuant to quarterly tender offers (such date of the offer, the Repurchase Date using a purchase price equal to the NAV per share as of the close of the last calendar day of the applicable quarter, except that Common Shares that have not been outstanding for at least one year will be repurchased at of such NAV (an Early Repurchase Deduction ). The one-year holding period is measured as of the subscription closing date immediately following the prospective repurchase date. The Early Repurchase Deduction will be retained by the Company for the benefit of remaining shareholders.

 The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q (the Quarterly Report ). 
 Overview 
 The Company is a Delaware statutory trust formed on October 20, 2021 to act as a non-diversified, closed-end management investment company. On May 31, 2023, the Company elected to be regulated as a BDC under the 1940 Act. In addition, the Company expects to elect to be treated as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code and expects to qualify as a RIC annually thereafter. 
 The Company is offering and selling its common shares of beneficial interest, par value 0.001 per share (the Common Shares in a continuous private placement (the Private Offering in the United States under the exemption provided by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ), and Regulation D promulgated thereunder. The Company has registered a public offering with the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC to sell up to 5.0 billion of common shares of beneficial interest, par value 0.001, on a continuous basis, but will not commence a public offering until such offering has been registered in all of the necessary U.S. states and territories. Additionally, the Company has applied to the SEC for exemptive relief to permit the Company to offer multiple classes of Common Shares in the public offering. 
 The Company commenced its loan origination process and investment activities contemporaneously with the initial closing (excluding the initial seed capital investment made by the Adviser) (the Initial Closing of the Private Offering of its Common Shares on June 12, 2023 and commenced operations following its first capital call on July 10, 2023 Commencement of Operations ). 
 The Company is externally managed by the Adviser. The Adviser oversees the management of the Company s activities and supervises the activities of the Subadviser. FEAC, an alternative credit adviser that is a wholly-owned subsidiary of FEIM, serves as the Company s investment subadviser and administrator. 
 The Company s investment objectives are to generate returns in the form of current income and, to a lesser extent, long-term capital appreciation of investments. Under normal circumstances, the Company expects that the majority of its total assets will be in private credit investments to U.S. private companies through (i) directly originated first lien senior secured cash flow loans, (ii) directly originated asset-based loans, (iii) club deals (directly originated first lien senior secured loans or asset-based loans in which the Company co-invests with a small number of third party private debt providers), (iv) second lien loans, and (v) broadly syndicated loans, Rule 144A high yield bonds and other debt securities (the investments described in this sentence, collectively, Private Credit ). Under normal circumstances, the Company will invest at least 80 of its total assets (net assets plus borrowings for investment purposes) in private credit investments (loans and other credit instruments that are issued in private offerings or issued by private U.S. or non-U.S. companies). To a lesser extent, the Company will also invest in broadly syndicated loans of publicly traded issuers, publicly traded high yield bonds and equity securities. The Company expects that investments in broadly syndicated loans and high yield bonds will generally be more liquid than other Private Credit assets and will likely be used to initially deploy capital upon receipt of subscriptions and may also be used for the purposes of maintaining and managing liquidity for its share repurchase program and cash management, while also presenting an opportunity for attractive investment returns. 
 Key Components of Our Results of Operations 
 Revenues 
 We generate revenue in the form of interest income on debt investments, capital gains, and dividend income from our equity investments in our portfolio companies. Our debt investments will generally bear interest at a fixed or floating rate. Interest on debt securities is generally payable monthly, quarterly or semiannually. In some cases, some of our investments may provide for deferred interest payments or payment-in-kind PIK interest. The principal amount of the debt securities and any accrued but unpaid PIK interest generally will become due at the maturity date. In addition, we may generate revenue in the form of commitment and other fees in connection with transactions. OIDs and market discounts or premiums will be capitalized, and we will accrete or amortize such amounts as interest income. We will record prepayment premiums on loans and debt securities as interest income. Dividend income, if any, will be recognized on an accrual basis to the extent that we expect to collect such amounts. 
 Expenses 
 Except as specifically provided below, all investment professionals and staff of the Advisers, when and to the extent engaged in providing investment advisory services to the Company, and the base compensation, bonuses and benefits of such 
 40 

personnel and the routine overhead expenses (including rent, office equipment and utilities) allocable to such services, will be provided and paid for by the Advisers. 
 The Company will bear all other costs and expenses of the Company s operations, administration and transactions. Our primary operating expenses include the payment of base management fees and incentive fees to the Adviser pursuant to the Advisory Agreement, the payment of fees to the Administrator for the Company s allocable portion of compensation, overhead and other expenses incurred by the Administrator in performing its administrative obligations under the Administration Agreement, interest expense on borrowing, and other operating costs. Refer to Note 3 Agreements and Related Party Transactions in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our Advisory Agreement and Administration Agreement. 
 Expense Support and Conditional Reimbursement Agreement 
 The Company has entered into an Expense Support Agreement with the Adviser. For additional information see Note 3 Agreements and Related Party Transactions in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 Portfolio and Investment Activity 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company made new investments in 102 new portfolio companies for an aggregate principal amount of 534.7 million (including 46.8 million of unfunded commitments), all of which was first lien debt.

As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, our portfolio companies had a weighted average annual adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization EBITDA of approximately 43.2 million and 48.3 million, respectively. Amounts are weighted based on fair value of each respective investment. These calculations include all private debt investments for which fair value is determined by the Valuation Designee and excludes quoted assets and asset-based loan investments ABL ), as well as companies with negative or de minimus EBITDA. Amounts were derived from the most recently available portfolio company financial statements, have not been independently estimated by us, and may reflect a normalized or adjusted amount.

(1)	Direct Lending involves loans where the Company lends directly to the borrower and holds the loan generally on its own or only with affiliates and, in some cases, third-party lenders. 
 (2)	Club Loans are directly originated first lien senior secured loans or asset-based loans in which the Company co-invests with a small number of third party private debt providers. 
 (3)	Syndicated Loans are generally originated by a bank and then syndicated, or sold, in several pieces to other investors. 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2024, ABL investments represented 1.5 and 21.4 , respectively, of the total fair market value of all of our investments.

(1)	Weighted average spread above the applicable reference rate (i.e. SOFR, Base Rate, etc.) for the Direct Lending portfolio, weighted based on the fair value of each respective investment. 
 (2)	Average adjusted EBITDA for the Direct Lending portfolio, weighted based on fair value of each respective investment. This calculation includes all Direct Lending investments for which fair value is determined by the Valuation Designee and excludes quoted assets and ABL investments, as well as companies with negative or de minimis EBITDA. Amounts are derived from the most recently available portfolio company financial statements, have not been independently estimated by us, and may reflect a normalized or adjusted amount. Accordingly, we make no representation or warranty in respect of this information. 
 (3)	Average LTV represents the net ratio of loan-to-value for each Direct Lending portfolio company, weighted based on the fair value of each respective investment. This calculation includes all Direct Lending investments for which fair value is determined by the Valuation Designee and excludes quoted assets and ABL investments. LTV is calculated as the current total net debt through each respective loan tranche divided by the estimated enterprise value of the portfolio company. Amounts were derived from the most recently available portfolio company financial statements, have not been independently verified by us, and may reflect a normalized or adjusted amount. Accordingly, we make no representation or warranty in respect of this information. 
 (4)	Average leverage ratio represents the leverage ratio for each Direct Lending portfolio company, weighted based on the fair value of each respective investment. This calculation includes all Direct Lending investments for which fair value is determined by the Valuation Designee and excludes quoted assets and ABL investments, as well as companies with negative or de minimis EBITDA. Company leverage is calculated as the current total debt as defined in the underlying applicable investment credit agreement through each respective loan tranche divided by the adjusted EBITDA as defined in the underlying applicable investment credit agreement of the portfolio company. Amounts were derived from the most recently available portfolio company financial statements, have not been independently verified by us, and may reflect a normalized or adjusted amount. Accordingly, we make no representation or warranty in respect of this information. 
 Portfolio Asset Quality 
 We employ the use of board observation and information rights, regular dialogue with company management and sponsors, and detailed internally generated monitoring reports to actively monitor performance. Additionally, FEAC has developed a monitoring template that promotes compliance with these standards and that is used as a tool to assess investment performance relative to plan. 
 As part of the monitoring process, FEAC assesses the risk profile of each of our investments and assigns each portfolio investment a score of a 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5. 
 The investment performance scores are as follows: 
 1 - The portfolio investment is performing above our underwriting expectations. 
 2 - The portfolio investment is performing as expected at the time of underwriting. All new investments are initially scored a 2. 
 3 - The portfolio investment is operating below our underwriting expectations and requires closer monitoring. The company may be out of compliance with financial covenants, however, principal or interest payments are generally not past due. 
 4 - The portfolio investment is performing materially below our underwriting expectations and returns on our investment are likely to be impaired. Principal or interest payments may be past due, however, full recovery of principal and interest payments are expected. 
 5 - The portfolio investment is performing substantially below expectations and the risk of the investment has increased substantially. The company is in payment default and the principal and interest payments are not expected to be repaid in full. 
 For purposes of clarity, underwriting as referenced herein may be redetermined after the initial investment as a result of a transformative credit event or other material event whereby such initial underwriting is deemed by FEAC to be no longer appropriate for the purpose of assessing investment performance relative to plan. For any investment receiving a score of a 3 or lower, FEAC will increase their level of focus and prepare regular updates for the investment committee summarizing current operating results, material impending events and recommended actions. 
 FEAC monitors and, when appropriate, changes the investment scores assigned to each investment in our portfolio. In connection with our investment valuation process, the Adviser, the Subadviser and the Board review these investment scores on a quarterly basis. Our average portfolio company investment score was 1.93 and 1.96 at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The following is a distribution of the investment scores of our portfolio companies at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 (dollar amounts in thousands):

Loans are placed on non-accrual status when principal or interest payments are past due 30 days or more and/or when it is no longer probable that principal or interest will be collected. However, we may make exceptions to this policy if the loan has sufficient collateral value and is in the process of collection. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had no loans on non-accrual status. 
 Results of Operations

 Income Taxes, Including Excise Taxes 
 The Company intends to elect to be treated as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code, and we intend to operate in a manner so as to continue to qualify for the tax treatment applicable to RICs. To qualify for tax treatment as a RIC, we must, among other things, distribute to our shareholders in each taxable year generally at least 90 of the sum of our investment company taxable income, as defined by the Code (without regard to the deduction for dividends paid,), and net tax-exempt income for that taxable year. To maintain our tax treatment as a RIC, we among other things, intend to make the requisite distributions to our shareholders, which generally relieve us from corporate-level U.S. federal income taxes. 
 Depending on the level of taxable income earned in a tax year, we may carry forward taxable income (including net capital gains, if any) in excess of current year dividend distributions from the current tax year into the next tax year and pay a nondeductible 4 U.S. federal excise tax on such taxable income, as required. To the extent that we determine that our estimated current year annual taxable income will be in excess of estimated current year dividend distributions from such income, we will accrue excise tax on estimated excess taxable income. 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we accrued 38 of U.S. federal excise tax. For the three months ended September 30, 2023 and for the period from April 28, 2023 (initial capitalization) through September 30, 2023, we incurred no U.S. federal excise tax.

Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 We generate our liquidity and capital resources primarily from (i) net proceeds from private offerings of our equity, (ii) cash flows from our operations (including interest and fees earned from our investments and principal repayments and proceeds from sales of our investments), and (iii) borrowings under our existing leverage facilities and any financing arrangements we may enter into in the future. These financings may come in the form of borrowings from banks and issuances of senior securities. Any such incurrences or issuances would be subject to prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual and regulatory restrictions and other factors. Our primary uses of cash include (i) investments in portfolio companies in accordance with our investment strategy, (ii) general corporate operations (including payments to the Adviser and Subadviser), (iii) debt service of any borrowings, (iv) share repurchases under our share repurchase program, and (v) cash distributions to our shareholders. We believe our current cash position, available capacity on our Credit Facility and net cash provided by operating activities will provide us with sufficient resources to meet our obligations and continue to support our investment objectives, including reserving for the capital needs which may arise at our portfolio companies. 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had 42.2 million and 183.4 million, respectively, in cash and cash equivalents. Additionally, as of September 30, 2024 we had 233.6 million of borrowings outstanding and 116.4 million available for additional borrowings under the Credit Facility, subject to borrowing base availability. As of December 31, 2023 we had no borrowings outstanding and 350.0 million available for additional borrowings under the Credit Facility, subject to borrowing base availability. See Debt below for additional information. 
 We are required to meet an asset coverage ratio, defined under the 1940 Act as the ratio of our total assets (less all liabilities and indebtedness not represented by senior securities) to our outstanding senior securities, of at least 150 after each issuance of senior securities. As of September 30, 2024, our asset coverage ratio was 228.4 . 
 Cash Flows

 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and the period April 28, 2023 (initial capitalization) through September 30, 2023, our financing activities included proceeds of 50.0 million and 51.4 million, respectively, from the issuance of Common Shares and 238.6 million and zero, respectively, from borrowings under our Credit Facility. Additionally our financing activities included the payment of 2.2 million and 0.7 million, respectively, for offering costs, and 1.3 million and 1.3 million for deferred financing costs, respectively.

With respect to distributions, we have adopted an opt out distribution reinvestment plan for shareholders. As a result, in the event of a declared cash distribution or other distribution, each shareholder that has not opted out of the distribution reinvestment plan will have their dividends or distributions automatically reinvested in additional shares rather than receiving cash distributions. Shareholders who receive distributions in the form of shares will be subject to the same U.S. federal, state and local tax consequences as if they received cash distributions. 
 Debt 
 On September 22, 2023, the SPV, a wholly-owned financing subsidiary of the Company, the Company, as transferor, and FEPC Fund Servicer, LLC, as servicer, an affiliate of the Company, entered into a 350 million senior secured revolving credit facility, as amended, (the Credit Facility with Morgan Stanley Bank N.A., as initial lender, certain other lenders from time to time party thereto, Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc., as administrative agent, U.S. Bank Trust Company, National Association, as collateral agent, U.S. Bank National Association, as account bank and collateral custodian, and FEPC Fund Servicer, LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, as servicer under the Credit Facility. On June 20, 2024, the SPV entered into the second amendment to the loan and servicing agreement Second Amendment ), amending the Credit Facility. The Second Amendment (i) amends the concentration limitation component of the borrowing base to allow, (x) until April 1, 2025, up to 75 of the SPV s portfolio to be broadly syndicated loans or senior secured bonds, (y) thereafter until September 30, 2025, 50 of the SPV s portfolio to be broadly syndicated loans or senior secured bonds, and (z) after September 30, 2025, 35 of the SPV s portfolio to be broadly syndicated loans or senior secured bonds, (ii) reduces the minimum utilization amount under the Credit Facility to be 35 of the commitments under the Credit Facility until September 22, 2024, and (iii) changes the interest rate applicable to the minimum utilization amount to be only the applicable margin. 
 The Company s ability to borrow under the Credit Facility is subject to certain financial and restrictive covenants, as well as availability under the borrowing base, which permits the Company to borrow up to 75 of the principal balance of its eligible portfolio company investments depending on the type of investment, subject to a maximum advance rate on the portfolio of 65 . Under the terms of the Credit Facility, the SPV is permitted to reinvest available cash and make new borrowings under the Credit Facility through September 22, 2026. The Credit Facility has a minimum utilization requirement of 35 of the facility amount (following a nine-month ramp-up period through September 21, 2024). The minimum utilization requirement increases to 65 from September 22, 2024 through the end of the revolving period. Distributions from the SPV to the Company are limited by the terms of the Credit Facility, which generally allows for the distribution of net interest income quarterly pursuant to a waterfall during the reinvestment period. The SPV s obligations under the Credit Facility are secured by a first priority security interest in substantially all of the assets of the SPV, including its portfolio of investments and the Company s equity interest in the SPV. As of September 30, 2024, the Company held 88 positions in the SPV s account for collateral under the Credit Facility. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had 393.3 million of borrowings outstanding under the Credit Facility. As of December 31, 2023, the Company held 17 positions in the SPV s account for collateral under the Credit Facility. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had no outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility. 
 The Credit Facility has a scheduled maturity date of September 22, 2028, or earlier in accordance with the terms of the Credit Facility. Borrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest initially at the annual rate of three month SOFR plus a spread. The initial spread is 3.05 per annum for term SOFR advances during the revolving period and 3.55 per annum during the amortization period. Additionally, the SPV pays a fee of 0.15 per annum on the notional loan amount of 350 million and an unused fee of 0.60 per annum on any unused portion of the Credit Facility.

 Related Party Transactions 
 Refer to Note 3 Agreements and Related Party Transactions in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 The preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Changes in the economic environment, financial markets, and any other parameters used in determining such estimates could cause actual results to differ. Our critical accounting policies and estimates should be read in connection with our risk factors described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K and our Pre-Effective Registration Statement on Form N-2. 
 Revenue Recognition 
 Interest Income 
 Interest income, adjusted for amortization of premium and accretion of discount, is recorded on an accrual basis to the extent that the Company expects to collect such amounts. Discounts from and premiums to par value on debt investments, loan origination fees and upfront fees received that are deemed to be an adjustment to yield are accreted/amortized into interest income over the life of the respective security using the effective interest method. Upon prepayment of a loan or debt security, any prepayment premiums, unamortized upfront loan origination fees and unamortized discounts are recorded as interest income in the current period. 
 The Company will recognize any earned exit or back-end fees into income when it believes the amounts will ultimately become collected by using either the beneficial interest model or other appropriate income recognition frameworks. 
 PIK Income 
 PIK interest is computed at the contractual rate specified in each investment agreement, is added to the principal balance of the investment, and is recorded as income. 
 Dividend Income 
 Dividend income on preferred equity investments is recorded on an accrual basis to the extent that such amounts are payable by the portfolio company and are expected to be collected. Dividend income on common equity investments is recorded on the record date for private portfolio companies and on the ex-dividend date for publicly traded portfolio companies. 
 Other Income 
 The Company may also generate revenue in the form of structuring, arranger or due diligence fees, amendment or consent fees, portfolio company administration fees, fees for providing significant managerial assistance and consulting fees. Such fees are recognized as income when earned or the services are rendered. 
 Valuation of Portfolio Investments 
 50 

The Board designated FEIM as the Valuation Designee as that term is defined in Rule 2a-5. As the Valuation Designee, the Board designated FEIM to perform fair value determinations of the Company s assets by implementing valuation policies and procedures approved by the Board, subject to the oversight of the Board and the Audit Committee, and in compliance with the requirements of Rule 2a-5. 
 In calculating the value of our total assets, investments for which market quotations are readily available are valued using market quotations, which are generally obtained from an independent pricing service or one or more broker-dealers or market makers. Debt and equity securities for which market quotations are not readily available or are determined to be unreliable are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by the Valuation Designee. 
 With respect to investments for which market quotations are not readily available, we undertake a multi-step valuation process each quarter, as described below: 

1. 
 the Company s valuation process begins with each portfolio company or investment being initially valued by the investment professionals responsible for managing portfolio investments; concurrently therewith, on at least an annual basis, independent valuation firms are used to conduct independent appraisals of all investments for which market quotations are either not readily available or are determined to be unreliable unless the amount of an investment is immaterial; 

2. 
 the preliminary valuation recommendation of the investment professionals and the applicable input of the independent valuation firms (the Preliminary Valuation Data are then documented and reviewed with FEAC s pricing professionals; 

3. 
 the Preliminary Valuation Data are then discussed with, and approved by, the pricing committee of FEAC; 

4. 
 FEIM s valuation committee independently discusses the Preliminary Valuation Data and determines the fair value of each investment in good faith based on the Preliminary Valuation Data; and 

5. 
 on a quarterly basis, a designee of FEIM s valuation committee discusses the fair value determinations of each investment with the Audit Committee. 

The types of factors that FEIM may take into account in fair value pricing the Company s investments include, as relevant, the nature and realizable value of any collateral, the portfolio company s ability to make payments and its earnings and discounted cash flows, the markets in which the portfolio company does business, comparison to publicly traded securities and other relevant factors. 
 Net Realized Gains or Losses and Net Change in Unrealized Appreciation or Depreciation 
 We measure realized gains or losses by the difference between the net proceeds from the repayment or sale and the amortized cost basis of the investment, using the specific identification method, without regard to unrealized appreciation or depreciation previously recognized. Net change in unrealized appreciation or depreciation reflects the change in portfolio investment values during the reporting period, including any reversal of previously recorded unrealized appreciation or depreciation, when gains or losses are realized. 
 U.S. Federal Income Taxes, Including Excise Tax 
 The Company intends to elect to be treated as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code, and intends to operate in a manner so as to continue to qualify each year as a RIC under the Code. So long as the Company maintains its tax treatment as a RIC, it will not be subject to corporate-level federal income tax on the portion of its ordinary income and capital gains distributed to shareholders as dividends. 
 In order to qualify for favorable tax treatment as a RIC, the Company is required to, among other things, distribute annually to its shareholders at least 90 of the sum of (i) its investment company taxable income, as defined by the Code but determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid, and (ii) its net tax-exempt income for such taxable year. 
 Recent Developments 
 On October 30, 2024, the Company s Board declared a distribution of 0.21 per Common Share, which is payable on November 26, 2024 to shareholders of record as of October 31, 2024. 
 On November 7, 2024, the SPV entered into the third amendment to the loan and servicing agreement Third Amendment ), amending the Credit Facility. The Third Amendment (i) reduces the spread to 2.55 per annum during the revolving period and 3.05 per annum during the amortization period; (ii) amends the 5 PIK loan concentration limitation component of the borrowing base to exclude from the concentration limitation PIK loans with a minimum cash spread of at least 5 paid quarterly; (iii) increases 
 51 

the minimum utilization amount to be 75 of the commitments under the Credit Facility; and (iv) resets as of the Third Amendment date the time period the prepayment premium is due in connection with reducing or terminating commitments under the Loan Agreement.

Ite m 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 We are subject to financial market risks, including valuation risk and interest rate risk. 
 Valuation Risk 
 We have invested, and plan to continue to invest in directly originated debt and equity securities of middle market companies. Because we expect that there will not be a readily available market value for many of the investments in our portfolio, we expect to value many of our portfolio investments at fair value as determined in good faith by the Valuation Designee in accordance with a documented valuation policy and GAAP and that has been reviewed and approved by our Board. The Valuation Designee will provide the Board and the Audit Committee with periodic reports, no less than quarterly, that discuss the functioning of the valuation process, if applicable to that period, and that identify issues and valuation problems that have arisen, if any. Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of our investments may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a readily available market value existed for such investments, and the differences could be material. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 The majority of the loans in our portfolio have floating interest rates and we expect that our loans in the future may also have floating interest rates. These loans are usually based on a floating SOFR and typically have interest rate re-set provisions that adjust applicable interest rates under such loans to current market rates on a monthly or quarterly basis. The majority of the loans in our current portfolio have interest rate floors that will effectively convert the loans to fixed rate loans in the event interest rates decrease. In addition, our Credit Facility and Term Loan have a floating interest rate provision. We expect that other credit facilities into which we may enter in the future may also have floating interest rate provisions. 
 Assuming that the consolidated statement of assets and liabilities as of September 30, 2024 was to remain constant and that we took no actions to alter our existing interest rate sensitivity, the following table shows the annualized impact of hypothetical base rate changes in interest rates:

Market prices tend to fluctuate more for fixed-rate securities that have longer maturities. Although we have no policy governing the maturities of our investments, under current market conditions we expect that we will invest in a portfolio of debt generally having maturities of up to 10 years. Market prices for debt that pays a fixed rate of return tend to decline as interest rates rise. This means that we are subject to greater risk (other things being equal) than a fund invested solely in shorter-term, fixed-rate securities. Market prices for floating rate investments may also fluctuate in rising rate environments with prices tending to decline when credit spreads widen. A decline in the prices of the debt we own could adversely affect our net assets resulting from operations and the NAV of our Common Shares. 
 
 Ite m 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 
 (a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 In accordance with Rules 13a-15(b) and 15d-15(b) of the Exchange Act, we, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and determined that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective as of the end of the period covered by the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 
 (b) Changes in Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting 
 There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during our most recently completed fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II OTHE R INFORMATION 
 Ite m 1. Legal Proceedings. 
 We are not a defendant in any material pending legal proceeding, and no such material proceedings are known to be contemplated. However, from time to time, we may be party to certain legal proceedings incidental to the normal course of our business including the enforcement of our rights under the contracts with our portfolio companies. 
 Ite m 1A. Risk Factors. 
 For information regarding factors that could affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, see the risk factors discussed in Item 1A. Risk Factors of our annual report on Form 10-K , as well as those under the caption Risk Factors in our Registration Statement on Form N-2 filed with the SEC on March 29, 2024 and June 4, 2024, respectively. These risks are not the only risks facing our Company. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or operating results. 
 Ite m 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds. 
 The Company is offering and selling its Common Shares in a continuous private placement in the United States under the exemption provided by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act and Regulation D promulgated thereunder. 
 The Company did not sell any equity securities during the period covered in this report that were not registered under the Securities Act. 
 Beginning with the calendar quarter ending December 31, 2024, the Company will commence a share repurchase program in which it intends to offer to repurchase in each quarter, at the discretion of the Board, up to 5 of the Company s Common Shares outstanding (either by number of shares or aggregate NAV) as of the close of the last calendar day of the applicable quarter. The Board may amend or suspend the share repurchase program at any time if in its reasonable judgment it deems such action to be in the Company s best interest and the best interest of its shareholders. As a result, share repurchases may not be available each quarter, such as when a repurchase offer would place an undue burden on the Company s liquidity, adversely affect its operations or risk having an adverse impact on the Company that would outweigh the benefit of the repurchase offer. Following any such suspension, the Board intends to reinstate the share repurchase program when appropriate and subject to our Board s duties to the Company. The Company intends to conduct such repurchase offers in accordance with the requirements of Rule 13e-4, promulgated under the Exchange Act, and the 1940 Act. All Common Shares purchased by us pursuant to the terms of each tender offer will be retired and thereafter will be authorized and unissued Common Shares. 
 During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, there were no repurchases of Common Shares under the Company s share repurchase program. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company had received capital commitments totaling 302.7 million. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had no uncalled capital commitments. 
 Ite m 3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities. 
 None. 
 Ite m 4. Mine Safety Disclosures. 
 None. 
 Ite m 5. Other Information. 
 During the quarter ended September 30, 2024 , no director or officer (as defined in Rule 16a-1(f) of the Exchange Act) of the Company or a Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement or a non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement , as each such term is defined in Item 408(c) of Regulation S-K.
