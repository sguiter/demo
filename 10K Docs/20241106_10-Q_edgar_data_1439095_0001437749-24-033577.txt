million and million, respectively. These contract asset balances are included within accounts receivable in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets. 
 
 We record contract liabilities, or deferred revenue, when cash payments are received from customers in advance of our performance, including amounts which are refundable. The deferred revenue balance at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was million and million, respectively. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , we recognized less than million and million, respectively, of the revenue that was deferred as of December 31, 2023 . During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 , we recognized million and million, respectively, of the revenue that was deferred as of December 31, 2022 . Deferred revenue balances are included within accrued expenses and other current liabilities in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets. 

Disaggregated Revenue : Our disaggregated revenue represents our business of selling PVF to energy and industrial end users across each of the Gas Utilities, DIET, and PTI sectors in each of our reportable segments. Each of our end markets and geographical reportable segments are impacted and influenced by varying factors, including macroeconomic environment, commodity prices, maintenance and capital spending and exploration and production activity. As such, we believe that this information is important in depicting the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of our revenue from contracts with customers. 

The following table presents our revenue disaggregated by revenue source (in millions):

The Company uses the last-in, first -out LIFO method of valuing U.S. inventories. The use of the LIFO method has the effect of reducing net income during periods of rising inventory costs (inflationary periods) and increasing net income during periods of falling inventory costs (deflationary periods). Valuation of inventory under the LIFO method can be made only at the end of each year based on the inventory levels and costs at that time. Accordingly, we base interim LIFO calculations on management s estimates of expected year-end inventory levels and costs and these estimates are subject to the final year-end LIFO inventory determination. 

years with a maximum lease term of years, including renewals. The exercise of lease renewal options is at our sole discretion; therefore, renewals to extend the terms of most leases are not included in our right of use ROU assets and lease liabilities as they are not reasonably certain of exercise. In the case of our regional distribution centers and certain corporate offices, where the renewal is reasonably certain of exercise, we include the renewal period in our lease term. Leases with escalation adjustments based on an index, such as the consumer price index, are expensed based on current rates. Leases with specified escalation steps are expensed based on the total lease obligation ratably over the life of the lease. Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the expected lease term. Non-lease components, such as payment of real estate taxes, maintenance, insurance and other operating expenses, have been excluded from the determination of our lease liability. 
 
 As most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we use an incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the commencement date in determining the present value of the lease payments using a portfolio approach. Our lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants. 
 
 Expense associated with our operating leases was million and mi llion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , respectively, and million and million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 , respectively, which we have classified in selling, general and administrative expenses. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , expense associated with our finance leases was million related to the amortization of ROU Assets, which we have classified in cost of sales, and less than million related to the interest on finance lease liabilities, which we have classified in interest expense. Cash paid for operating leases recognized as liabilities was million and million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , respectively, and million and million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 , respectively. Cash paid for finance leases was million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 .

Senior Secured Term Loan B : The Company had a Senior Secured Term Loan B (the Prior Term Loan with an original principal amount of million, which amortized in equal quarterly installments of per year with the balance payable in September 2024, when the facility was set to mature. In May 2024, the Company repaid the Prior Term Loan in its entirety using a combination of our asset-based lending facility and cash on hand. The outstanding principal balance on the Prior Term Loan at the date of repayment was million. The Company used million of the asset-based lending facility and million cash to repay the Prior Term Loan prior to its maturity. The early repayment of the Prior Term Loan resulted in a loss on early extinguishment of debt of million . All security securing the Prior Term Loan was released upon the repayment of the Prior Term Loan. The Prior Term Loan had an applicable interest rate margin of basis points in the case of loans incurring interest based on LIBOR, and basis points in the case of loans incurring interest based on the base rate. Beginning July 1, 2023, the LIBOR interest rate was calculated as the aggregate Chicago Mercantile Exchange ("CME") Term SOFR plus the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) credit adjustment spread. 
 
 Global ABL Facility : The Company is a party to a multi-currency, global asset-based lending facility (the Global ABL Facility ), including certain of its subsidiaries, its lenders and Bank of America, N.A. as administrative agent, security trustee and collateral agent. The Global ABL Facility is a revolving credit facility of million, which matures in September 2026. The Global ABL Facility is comprised of million in revolver commitments in the United States, which includes a million sub-limit for Canada, million in Norway, million in Australia, million in the Netherlands, million in the United Kingdom and million in Belgium. The Global ABL Facility contains an accordion feature that allows us to increase the principal amount of the facility by up to million, subject to securing additional lender commitments. MRC Global Inc. and each of its current and future wholly owned material U.S. subsidiaries guarantee the obligations of our borrower subsidiaries under the Global ABL Facility. Additionally, each of our non-U.S. borrower subsidiaries guarantees the obligations of our other non-U.S. borrower subsidiaries under the Global ABL Facility. Outstanding obligations are generally secured by a first priority security interest in accounts receivable, inventory and related assets. U.S. borrowings under the amended facility bear interest at Term SOFR (as defined in the Global ABL Facility) plus a margin varying between and based on our fixed charge coverage ratio. Canadian borrowings under the facility bear interest at the Canadian Dollar Bankers' Acceptances Rate ("BA Rate") plus a margin varying between and based on our fixed charge coverage ratio. Borrowings under our foreign borrower subsidiaries bear interest at a benchmark rate, which varies based on the currency in which such borrowings are made, plus a margin varying between and based on our fixed charge coverage ratio. Availability is dependent on a borrowing base comprised of a percentage of eligible accounts receivable and inventory, which is subject to redetermination from time to time. Excess Availability, as defined under our Global ABL Facility, was million as of September 30, 2024 . 
 
 Interest on Borrowings : The interest rates on our outstanding borrowings at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , including amortization of debt issuance costs, were as follows:

Our rates generally differ from the U.S. federal statutory rates of as a result of state income taxes, non-deductible expenses and differing foreign income tax rates. The effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was favorably impacted by a net reduction in the valuation allowance provision, partially offset by foreign losses with no tax benefit due to valuation allowances.

shares of Series A Convertible Perpetual Preferred Stock (the Preferred Stock and received gross proceeds of million. On October 29, 2024, the Company repurchased all of the outstanding shares of the Preferred Stock for million plus accrued dividends, and all of the Preferred Stock was retired on October 30, 2024. See Note 12 Subsequent Events. Before its repurchase, t he Preferred Stock ranked senior to our common stock with respect to dividend rights and rights on liquidation, winding-up and dissolution. The Preferred Stock had a stated value of per share, and holders of Preferred Stock were entitled to cumulative dividends payable quarterly in cash at a rate of per annum. 
 
 The Preferred Stock was convertible at the option of the holders into shares of common stock at an initial conversion rate of shares of common stock for each share of Preferred Stock, which represented an initial conversion price of per share of common stock, subject to adjustment. The Company had the option to redeem, in whole but not in part, all the outstanding shares of Preferred Stock at par value, subject to certain redemption price adjustments. We had the election to convert the Preferred Stock, in whole but not in part, into the relevant number of shares of common stock if the last reported sale price of the common stock had been at least of the conversion price then in effect for a specified period. The conversion rate was subject to customary anti-dilution and other adjustments. 
 
 Holders of the Preferred Stock could have, at their option, required the Company to repurchase their shares in the event of a fundamental change, as defined in the agreement. The repurchase price was based on the original 1,000 per share purchase price except in the case of a liquidation, in which case the holders would have received the greater of 1,000 per share and the amount that would have been received if they held common stock converted at the conversion rate in effect at the time of the fundamental change. Because this feature could have required redemption as a result of the occurrence of an event not solely within the control of the Company, the Preferred Stock was classified as temporary equity on our balance sheet. 

performance share unit awards, re stricted stock awards, shares of restricted stock units have been granted to executive management, members of our Board of Directors and employees.

million from which the Company received payments at 1 -month LIBOR and made monthly payments at a fixed rate of with settlement and reset dates on or near the last business day of each month until maturity. The fair value of the swap at inception was zero. 
 
 We designated the interest rate swap as an effective cash flow hedge utilizing the guidance under ASU 2017 - 12. As such, the valuation of the interest rate swap was recorded as an asset or liability, and the gain or loss on the derivative was recorded as a component of other comprehensive income (loss). Interest rate swap agreements are reported on the accompanying balance sheets at fair value utilizing observable Level 2 inputs such as yield curves and other market-based factors. We obtain dealer quotations to value our interest rate swap agreements. The fair value of our interest rate swap was estimated based on the present value of the difference between expected cash flows calculated at the contracted interest rates and the expected cash flows at current market interest rates. 
 
 On March 31, 2023, the interest rate swap agreement expired and was not extended with any new agreements or amendments. An immaterial net gain recorded as a component of other comprehensive loss was reclassified to interest expense as of March 31, 2023.

We estimate the fair value of our debt using Level 2 inputs or quoted market prices. 

lawsuits involving approximately claims. No asbestos lawsuit has resulted in a judgment against us to date, with a majority being settled, dismissed or otherwise resolved. Applicable third -party insurance has substantially covered these claims, and insurance should continue to cover a substantial majority of existing and anticipated future claims. Accordingly, we have recorded a liability for our estimate of the most likely settlement of asserted claims and a related receivable from insurers for our estimated recovery, to the extent we believe that the amounts of recovery are probable. It is not possible to predict the outcome of these claims and proceedings. However, in our opinion, the likelihood that the ultimate disposition of any of these claims and legal proceedings will have a material adverse effect on our condensed consolidated financial statements is remote. 
 
 Other Legal Claims and Proceedings. From time to time, we have been subject to various claims and involved in legal proceedings incidental to the nature of our businesses. We maintain insurance coverage to reduce financial risk associated with certain of these claims and proceedings. It is not possible to predict the outcome of these claims and proceedings. However, in our opinion, the likelihood that the ultimate disposition of any of these claims and legal proceedings will have a material adverse effect on our condensed consolidated financial statements is remote. 
 
 Unclaimed Property Audit. The Company is subject to state laws relating to abandoned and unclaimed property. States routinely audit the records of companies to assess compliance with such laws. The Company is currently undergoing a multi-state unclaimed property audit. The timing and outcome of the multi-state unclaimed property audit cannot be predicted. We have reserved all of our rights, claims, and defenses. Given the nature of these matters, we are unable to reasonably estimate the total possible loss or ranges of loss, if any. If the Company is found to be in noncompliance with applicable unclaimed property laws or the manner in which those laws are interpreted or applied, states may determine that they are entitled to the Company's remittance of unclaimed or abandoned property and further may seek to impose other costs on the Company, including penalties and interest. We intend to vigorously contest the above matter; however, an adverse decision in this matter could have an adverse impact on us, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 
 Product Claims. From time to time, in the ordinary course of our business, our customers may claim that the products that we distribute are either defective or require repair or replacement under warranties that either we or the manufacturer may provide to the customer. These proceedings are, in the opinion of management, ordinary and routine matters incidental to our normal business. Our purchase orders with our suppliers generally require the manufacturer to indemnify us against any product liability claims, leaving the manufacturer ultimately responsible for these claims. In many cases, state, provincial or foreign law provides protection to distributors for these sorts of claims, shifting the responsibility to the manufacturer. In some cases, we could be required to repair or replace the products for the benefit of our customer and seek our recovery from the manufacturer for our expense. In our opinion, the likelihood that the ultimate disposition of any of these claims and legal proceedings will have a material adverse effect on our condensed consolidated financial statements is remote. 
 
 In Re: July 27 Chemical Release Litigation. In 2019, the Company's customer, Lyondell Chemical, a subsidiary of LyondellBassell Industries Holdings B.V. (collectively with its subsidiaries, "Lyondell"), entered into an order with the Company's subsidiary, MRC Global (US) Inc., for MRC Global (US) to facilitate a refurbishment of a Lyondell-owned valve by the valve manufacturer, Xomax Corporation, a subsidiary of Crane Co. (collectively with its subsidiaries, "Crane"), and thereafter for MRC Global (US) to affix a new bracket and actuator to the refurbished Crane Valve. When Crane completed the refurbishment, it shipped the valve to MRC Global (US), which, in turn, procured a bracket from a third -party fabricator and installed the bracket and an actuator on the valve and redelivered the valve back to Lyondell. Almost two years later, in 2021, Lyondell contracted with Turn2 Specialty Companies, LLC "Turn2" to remove the actuator as part of a maintenance and repair job that was being performed on a Lyondell pipe. While performing the actuator removal job, representatives of Turn2 removed more than the necessary bolts required to remove the actuator, which caused a release from a "live", pressurized line of chemicals. Two fatalities occurred from the release along with injuries to others at or near the site. plaintiffs, including the estates of the two fatalities, sued Lyondell, Turn2 and others in Texas State Court pursuant to multiple lawsuits. These cases were consolidated into a multi-district litigation assigned to the 190th Judicial Court of Harris County, Texas. Lyondell and Turn2 have either settled with the plaintiffs or were dismissed based on payments that they made to plaintiffs for workers' compensation, thus, availing themselves of the workers' compensation bar. 

On July 24, 2023, just days prior to the expiration of the statute of limitations, the plaintiffs added MRC Global (US), Crane and others to their lawsuits. Plaintiffs claim that MRC Global (US) failed to warn Turn2 of the dangers of removing the wrong bolts and failed to properly instruct Lyondell and Turn2 on how to remove the actuator. The plaintiffs also allege that MRC Global (US) is responsible as an assembler or seller of the final valve package distributed to Lyondell. MRC Global (US) disagrees that it has any liability and expects to vigorously defend these claims. Plaintiffs have asserted various claims for damages, including for bodily injury, past and future medical expenses, lost wages, mental anguish, pain and suffering and punitive damages. Plaintiffs' have indicated that they will be seeking damages from all defendants that would be in excess of the Company's insurance for these suits. Thus, adverse outcomes in these suits could have a material effect on us, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 
 MRC Global and its insurers have settled with of the plaintiffs within MRC Global's insurance limits. The first trial (the "bellwether" trial) of the remaining suits, involving plaintiffs, is set for January 25, 2025, and the trial for the alleged wrongful death of the deceased Turn2 representatives is set for May 25, 2025. Any additional trials may follow after the resolution of these initial cases. At this time, we are unable to predict the outcome of these proceedings. 
 
 Customer Contracts 
 
 We have contracts and agreements with many of our customers that dictate certain terms of our sales arrangements (pricing, deliverables, etc.). While we make every effort to abide by the terms of these contracts, certain provisions are complex and often subject to varying interpretations. Under the terms of these contracts, our customers have the right to audit our adherence to the contract terms. Historically, any settlements that have resulted from these customer audits have not been material to our condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 
 Purchase Commitments 
 
 We have purchase obligations consisting primarily of inventory purchases made in the normal course of business to meet operating needs. While our vendors often allow us to cancel these purchase orders without penalty, in certain cases, cancellations may subject us to cancellation fees or penalties depending on the terms of the contract.

Key Drivers of Our Business 
 
 We derive our revenue predominantly from the sale of PVF and other supplies to gas utility, energy, and industrial customers globally. Our business is dependent upon both the current conditions and future prospects in these industries and, in particular, our customers' maintenance and expansionary operating and capital expenditures. The outlook for PVF spending is influenced by numerous factors, including the following: 

Gas Utility and Energy Infrastructure Integrity and Modernization . Ongoing maintenance and upgrading of existing energy facilities, pipelines and other infrastructure equipment is a meaningful driver for business across the sectors we serve. This is particularly true for the Gas Utiliti es sector. Activity with customers in this sector is driven by upgrades and replacement of existing infrastructure as well as new residential and commercial development. Continual maintenance of an aging network of pipelines and local distribution networks is a critical requirement for these customers irrespective of broader economic conditions. As a result, this business tends to be more stable over time than our traditional oilfield-dependent businesses and moves independently of commodity prices. 

Oil and Natural Gas Demand and Prices . Sales of PVF and infrastructure products to the oil and natural gas industry constitute a significant portion of our sales. As a result, we depend upon the maintenance and capital expenditures of oil and natural gas companies to explore for, produce and process oil, natural gas and refined products. Demand for oil and natural gas, current and projected commodity prices and the costs necessary to produce oil and gas impact customer capital spending, additions to and maintenance of pipelines, refinery utilization and petrochemical processing activity. Additionally, as these participants rebalance their capital investment away from traditional, carbon-based energy toward alternative sources, we expect to continue to supply them and enhance our product and service offerings to support their changing requirements, including in areas such as carbon capture utilization and storage, biofuels, offshore wind and hydrogen processing. 

Economic Conditions . Changes in the general economy or in the energy sector (domestically or internationally) can cause demand for fuels, feedstocks and petroleum-derived products to vary, thereby causing demand for the products we distribute to materially change. 

Manufacturer and Distributor Inventory Levels of PVF and Related Products . Manufacturer and distributor inventory levels of PVF and related products can change significantly from period to period. Increased inventory levels by manufacturers or other distributors can cause an oversupply of PVF and related products in the industry sectors we serve and reduce the prices that we are able to charge for the products we distribute. Reduced prices, in turn, would likely reduce our profitability. Conversely, decreased manufacturer inventory levels may ultimately lead to increased demand for our products and often result in increased revenue, higher PVF pricing and improved profitability. 

Steel Prices, Availability and Supply and Demand . Fluctuations in steel prices can lead to volatility in the pricing of the products we distribute, especially carbon steel line pipe products, which can influence the buying patterns of our customers. A majority of the products we distribute contain various types of steel. The worldwide supply and demand for these products and other steel products that we do not supply, impact the pricing and availability of our products and, ultimately, our sales and operating profitability. Additionally, supply chain disruptions with key manufacturers or in markets in which we source products can impact the availability of inventory we require to support our customers. Furthermore, logistical challenges, including inflation and availability of freight providers and containers for shipping can also significantly impact our profitability and inventory lead-times. These constraints can also present an opportunity, as our supply chain expertise allows us to meet customer expectations when the competition may not. 

Recent Trends and Outlook 
 
 We continue to support our customers in the Gas Utilities sector and traditional energy markets along with other industrial end markets and the rapidly evolving energy transition. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, revenue decreased 35 million sequentially from the three months ended June 30, 2024, and decreased 91 million from the three months ended September 30, 2023. For the quarter ended September 30, 2024, 68 of our revenue was derived from our Gas Utilities and DIET sectors, with the remainder in the PTI sector.

Table of Contents 

Gas Utilities 
 Our Gas Utility business makes up 35 of our total company revenue for the first nine months of 2024, with a 10 decrease in revenue compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Sequentially, this sector experienced increased revenue of 3 in the third quarter, compared to the second quarter of 2024. Although the long-term growth fundamentals of this sector remain intact, several key gas utilities customers are currently focused on reducing their own product inventory levels due to more certainty in the supply chain and associated lead times. Higher interest rates and inflation in construction costs are causing customers to delay project activity. Although we have experienced lower sales activity in this sector compared to prior year and believe this trend will continue into at least the first quarter of 2025, the long-term market drivers remain positive due to distribution integrity upgrade programs as well as new home construction in certain U.S. states. The majority of the work we perform with our gas utility customers are multi-year programs where they continually evaluate, monitor and implement measures to improve their pipeline distribution networks, ensuring the safety and the integrity of their system. As of 2023, which is the most recently available information, the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) estimates approximately 35 of the gas distribution main and service line miles are over 40 years old or of unknown origin. This infrastructure requires continuous replacement and maintenance as these gas distribution networks continue to age. We supply many of the replacement products including valves, line pipe, smart meters, risers and other gas products. A large percentage of the line pipe we sell is sold to our gas utilities customers for line replacement and new sections of their distribution network. As our gas utility customers connect new homes and businesses to their gas distribution network, the growth in the housing market creates new revenue opportunities for our business to supply the related infrastructure products. Some of our customers in this sector support both gas and electric distribution, and certain customers have announced allocating a higher proportion of their capital budget to electric distribution. However, based on market fundamentals, the need for natural gas to fuel new electric generation facilities and new market share opportunities, we expect the Gas Utilities sector to continue to have steady growth in the coming years. Additionally, due to its reduced dependency on energy demand and commodity prices this sector is less volatile than the others. 
 
 Downstream, Industrial and Energy Transition (DIET) 
 DIET generated 32 of our total company revenue for the first nine months of 2024, and decreased 1 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. We continue to expect this sector to deliver strong growth in the coming years driven by increased customer activity levels related to new energy transition related projects, maintenance, repair and operations ("MRO") activities and project turnaround activity in refineries and chemical plants. This sector has a significant amount of project activity, which can create substantial variability between quarters. 
 
 The energy transition portion of our business has grown rapidly in recent years, particularly for biofuels refinery projects. The outlook for energy transition projects in the coming years is robust as pressure to decarbonize the economy rises and government incentives and policies such as those in the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 begin to support the development of carbon energy alternatives. Also, many of our customers have made commitments to net zero emissions to address climate change. Our customer base represents many of the primary leaders in the energy transition movement and is positioned to lead the effort to decarbonize through nearer-term efforts such as renewable or biodiesel refineries and offshore wind power generation as well as longer-term efforts such as carbon capture and storage and hydrogen processing. These types of projects require similar products that we currently provide today to these customers. In addition, we sell low-emission valves, which represent 96 of our valve sales. These valves restrict the release of methane and other greenhouse gases into the environment and are increasingly required by our customers to meet their emission reduction commitments. We are well positioned to grow our energy transition business as we supply products for these projects through our long-standing customer relationships and our product and global supply chain expertise. 
 Production and Transmission Infrastructure (PTI) 
 The PTI sector of our business is the most cyclical, and in the first nine months of 2024 this sector represented 33 of our company revenues with an 11 decrease compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. During the first nine months of 2024, Brent crude oil price averaged approximately 83 per barrel and West Texas Intermediate ("WTI") oil prices averaged approximately 79 per barrel. Although, oil prices have recently declined from earlier highs seen in the last few years, OPEC+ production cuts have maintained prices at levels that support continued growth in drilling and completion activity by our customers. Natural gas prices also drive customer activity, and have experienced recent volatility and declines, and if, prices remain low, it could negatively impact our business. 
 
 Recent industry reports have signaled potential risk in oil prices and projected customer spending levels for the remainder of this year and in 2025. However, larger public exploration and production companies have been and are expected to continue to drive a higher percentage of the activity in 2024, which bodes well for us as our revenue for these sectors is driven predominantly from this customer base. We also expect our larger public customers will remain disciplined and consistent with their commitments to their budgets, maintaining returns to their shareholders and operating within their cash flow requirements. Additionally, we believe the recent announcements by several of our large customers related to acquisitions of smaller peers could benefit us in the coming years due to our current relationships with the acquiring companies.

Table of Contents 

To the extent completion activity and related production increase, this could have the impact of improving our revenue opportunities in our PTI sector. New well completions and higher production levels drive the need for additional surface equipment and gathering and processing infrastructure, benefitting this sector's revenue. 
 Supply Chain and Labor 
 For the majority of our products, lead times have returned to pre-pandemic levels. Transportation costs are also generally in line with pre-pandemic rates. 
 
 Inflation for the majority of our products have eased and we do not expect to see significant increases for the remainder of this year. To the extent further pricing fluctuations impact our products, the effect on our revenue and cost of goods sold, which is determined using the last-in first-out ("LIFO") inventory costing methodology, remains subject to uncertainty and volatility. However, our supply chain expertise, relationships with our key suppliers and inventory position has allowed us to manage the supply chain for both inflationary and deflationary pressures. In addition, our contracts with customers generally allow us to pass price increases along to customers within a reasonable time after they occur. 
 
 Many customers are focused on reducing their own product inventory levels due to more certainty in the supply chain and associated lead times. We have also been able to reduce our inventory levels due to this normalization in supply chain. 
 
 There has been little impact to our supply chain directly from the conflict in Ukraine. However, recent geopolitical conflicts or potential conflicts in Southeast Asia and the Middle East could have the potential to further constrain the global supply chain and impact the availability of component parts, particularly valves, regulators, and other various other components. 
 
 Although improving, we are being impacted by labor constraints and increased competition among companies to attract and retain personnel. We proactively monitor market trends in the areas where we have operations. We have created efficient sourcing practices and adapted to the volume of open positions to avoid disruption supporting our customers. 
 
 Backlog 
 We determine backlog by the amount of unshipped customer orders, which the customer may revise or cancel in certain instances. The table below details our backlog by segment (in millions):

Sales. Our sales were 797 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 888 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of 91 million, or 10 . This decrease reflects a decline in the PTI, DIET and Gas Utilities sectors of 41 million, 31 million and 19 million, respectively . 
 
 U.S. Segment Our U.S. sales decreased to 644 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 745 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. This 101 million, or 14 , decrease reflects the following: 

a decline in the PTI sector sales of 43 million due to lower line pipe sales and customer activity; 

a decline in D IET sector sales of 40 million due to fewer mining, refining and chemicals customers' projects and a decline in turnaround activity; and 

a decline in Gas Utilities sector sales of 18 million driven by a reduction in customers product inventory levels and fewer executed capital projects. 

Canada Segment Our Canada sales decreased to 26 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 38 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to a decrease of 14 million in the PTI sector due to reduced customer activity, partially offset by an increase in the DIET sector . 
 
 International Segment Our International sales increased to 127 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 105 million for the same period in 2023. This International sales increase of 22 million was primarily driven by the PTI sector followed by the DIET sector . In addition, the strengthening of foreign currencies in areas where we operate relative to the U.S. dollar favorably impacted sales by 1 million, or 1 . 
 
 Gross Profit. Our gross profit was 160 million (20.1 of sales) for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 183 million (20.6 of sales) for the three months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease of 23 million was primarily due to the decrease in sales and reduced margins in our line pipe product group . As compared to average cost, our LIFO inventory costing methodology decreased cost of sales by 5 millio n for the third quarter of 2024 compared to a 4 million decrease in cost of sales in the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Adjusted Gross Profit . Adjusted Gross Profit declined to 166 million (20.8 of sales) for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 189 million (21.3 of sales) for the three months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of 23 million due to lower sales and reduced margins primarily in our line pipe product group . Adjusted Gross Profit is a non-GAAP financial measure. We define Adjusted Gross Profit as sales, less cost of sales, plus depreciation and amortization, plus amortization of intangibles, plus inventory-related charges incremental to normal operations and plus or minus the impact of our LIFO inventory costing methodology. We present Adjusted Gross Profit because we believe it is a useful indicator of our operating performance without regard to items, such as amortization of intangibles that can vary substantially from company to company depending upon the nature and extent of acquisitions. Similarly, the impact of the LIFO inventory costing method can cause results to vary substantially from company to company depending upon which costing method they may elect. We use Adjusted Gross Profit as a key performance indicator in managing our business. We believe that gross profit is the financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles that is most directly comparable to Adjusted Gross Profit.

Selling, General and Administrative SG A Expenses. Our SG A expenses were 123 million (15.4 of sales) for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 126 million (14.2 of sales) for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The 3 million decrease in SG A was primarily driven by a reduction in personnel expenses. 
 
 Operating Income . Operating income was 37 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 , as compared to operating income of 57 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 , a decrease of 20 million. 
 
 U.S. Segment Operating income for our U.S. segment was 30 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 , compared to operating income of 54 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 , a 24 million decrease. The 24 million decrease was primarily attributable to lower sales. 
 
 Canada Segment Operatin g loss for our Canada segment was 2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to an operating loss of 2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Although operating loss remained the same for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year, we had overall lower sales and costs of sales for the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 International Segment Oper ating income fo r our International segment was 9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to operating income of 5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to increased sales. 
 
 Interest Expense . Our interest expense was 4 million and 9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease of 5 million was primarily due to less interest expense as a result of paying off the Term Loan B in the second quarter 2024. 
 
 Other, net. Other, net was 1 million expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 1 million income for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Income Tax Expense . Our income tax expense was 3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 14 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in expense is primarily d ue to a net reduction in the valuation allowance provision and decreased profitability. Our effective tax rates were 9 and 29 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , respectively. Our rates differ from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21 as a result of state income taxes, non-deductible expenses and differing foreign income tax rates. In addition, the effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was favorably impacted by a net reduction in the valuation allowance provision offset by foreign losses with no tax benefit. 
 
 Pillar Two. The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development has enacted model rules for a new global minimum tax framework, also known as Pillar Two, and continues to release additional guidance on how Pillar Two rules should be interpreted and applied by jurisdictions as they adopt Pillar Two. A number of countries have utilized the administrative guidance as a starting point for legislation that went into effect January, 1, 2024. These rules did not have a material impact on our taxes for the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Net Income . Our net income was 29 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to net income of 35 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Adjusted EBITDA . Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, was 48 million (6.0 of sales) for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 70 million (7.9 of sales) for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income plus interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, amortization of intangibles and certain other expenses, including non-cash expenses such as equity-based compensation, severance and restructuring, changes in the fair value of derivative instruments, long-lived asset impairments (including goodwill and intangible assets), inventory-related charges incremental to normal operations and plus or minus the impact of our LIFO inventory costing methodology. 
 
 We believe Adjusted EBITDA provides investors a helpful measure for comparing our operating performance with the performance of other companies that may have different financing and capital structures or tax rates. We believe it is a useful indicator of our operating performance without regard to items, such as amortization of intangibles, which can vary substantially from company to company depending upon the nature and extent of acquisitions. Similarly, the impact of the LIFO inventory costing method can cause results to vary substantially from company to company depending upon which costing method they may elect. We use Adjusted EBITDA as a key performance indicator in managing our business. We believe that net income is the financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles that is most directly comparable to Adjusted EBITDA.

Sales . Our sales were 2,435 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 2,644 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of 209 million, or 8 . This decrease reflects a decline in the PTI, Gas Utilities and DIET sectors of 103 million, 96 million and 10 million, respectively . 
 
 U.S. Segment Our U.S. sales decreased to 1,988 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , from 2,212 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 . This 224 million, or 10 , decrease reflects 

a decrease in the Gas Utilities sector of 93 million driven by non-recurring projects and a reduction in customers product inventory levels; 

a decrease in PTI sales of 92 millio n due to lower line pipe sales and spending levels; and 

a decrease in DIET sales of 39 million du e to a decline in turnaround activity. 

Canada Segment Our Canada sales declined to 88 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , from 118 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily as a result of a decrease of 43 million in the PTI sector due to reduced customer activity , partially offset by an increase in the DIET sector. The weakening of the Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar unfavorably impacted sales by 1 million, or 1 . 
 
 International Segment Our International sales increased to 359 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , from 314 million for the same period in 2023. This sales increase of 45 million was primarily driven by the PTI sector followed by the DIET sector. 
 
 Gross Profit.

 Adjusted Gross Profit. Adjusted Gross Profit decreased to 524 million (21.5 of sales) for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 564 million (21.3 of sales) for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, a decline of 40 million primarily due to the decrease in sales . Adjusted Gross Profit is a non-GAAP financial measure. We define Adjusted Gross Profit as sales, less cost of sales, plus depreciation and amortization, plus amortization of intangibles, plus inventory-related charges incremental to normal operations and plus or minus the impact of our LIFO inventory costing methodology. We present Adjusted Gross Profit because we believe it is a useful indicator of our operating performance without regard to items, such as amortization of intangibles that can vary substantially from company to company depending upon the nature and extent of acquisitions.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 Our primary credit facility as of September 30, 2024 was a 750 million Global ABL Facility. In addition, on October 29, 2024, we entered into a new 350 million senior secured term loan "B" facility ("Term Loan"). 
 
 Global ABL Facility 
 
 Our Global ABL Facility matures in September 2026 and provides 705 million in revolver commitments in the United States (with a 30 million sublimit in Canada), 12 million in Norway, 10 million in Australia, 10.5 million in the Netherlands, 7.5 million in the United Kingdom and 5 million in Belgium. The Global ABL Facility contains an accordion feature that allows us to increase the principal amount of the facility by up to 250 million, subject to securing additional lender commitments. U.S. borrowings bear interest at Term SOFR plus a margin varying between 1.25 and 1.75 based on our fixed charge coverage ratio. Canadian borrowings under the facility bear interest at the Canadian Dollar Bankers' Acceptances Rate ("BA Rate") plus a margin varying between 1.25 and 1.75 based on our fixed charge coverage ratio. Borrowings under our foreign borrower subsidiaries bear interest at a benchmark rate, which varies based on the currency in which such borrowings are made, plus a margin varying between 1.25 and 1.75 based on our fixed charge coverage ratio. Availability is dependent on a borrowing base comprised of a percentage of eligible accounts receivable and inventory which is subject to redetermination from time to time. As of September 30, 2024, we had 85 million borrowings outstanding and 485 million of Excess Availability, as defined under our Global ABL Facility. 
 
 Guarantees. Each of our current and future wholly owned material U.S. subsidiaries and MRC Global Inc. guarantees the obligations of our borrower subsidiaries under the Global ABL Facility. Additionally, each of our non-U.S. borrower subsidiaries guarantees the obligations of our other non-U.S. borrower subsidiaries under the Global ABL Facility. No non-U.S. subsidiary guarantees the U.S. tranche, and no property of our non-U.S. subsidiaries secures the U.S. tranche. 
 
 Security. Obligations under the U.S. tranche are primarily secured, subject to certain exceptions, by a first-priority security interest in the accounts receivable, inventory and related assets of our wholly owned, material U.S. subsidiaries. The security interest in accounts receivable, inventory and related assets of the U.S. borrower subsidiaries ranks prior to the security interest in this collateral which secures the Term Loan. The obligations of any of our non-U.S. borrower subsidiaries are primarily secured, subject to certain exceptions, by a first-priority security interest in the accounts receivable, inventory and related assets of the non-U.S. subsidiary and our wholly owned material U.S. subsidiaries. 

34

Table of Contents 

Borrowing Bases. Each of our non-U.S. borrower subsidiaries has a separate standalone borrowing base that limits the non-U.S. subsidiary s ability to borrow under its respective tranche; provided that the non-U.S. subsidiaries may utilize excess availability under the U.S. tranche to borrow amounts in excess of their respective borrowing bases (but not to exceed the applicable commitment amount for the foreign subsidiary s jurisdiction), which utilization will reduce availability under the U.S. tranche dollar for dollar. 
 
 Subject to the foregoing, our ability to borrow in each jurisdiction, other than Belgium, under the Global ABL Facility is limited by a borrowing base in that jurisdiction equal to 85 of eligible receivables, plus the lesser of 70 of eligible inventory and 85 of appraised net orderly liquidation value of the inventory. In Belgium, our borrowing is limited by a borrowing base determined under Belgian law. 
 
 Prior Term Loan 
 
 The Company had a prior senior secured term loan "B" (the "Prior Term Loan"), which was set to mature in September 2024 with an original principal amount of 400 million. In May 2024, the Company repaid the Prior Term Loan in its entirety using a combination of our asset-based lending facility and available cash. The outstanding principal balance on the Prior Term Loan at the date of repayment was 292 million. The Company used 216 million of the asset-based lending facility and 76 million cash to repay the Prior Term Loan prior to its maturity. 
 
 Preferred Stock Repurchase 
 
 On October 29, 2024 , the Company entered into a new 350 million Term Loan "B" (the "Term Loan") with a term of seven years. The proceeds from the new Term Loan, cash on hand and borrowings from the Company's Global ABL Facility were used to repurchase all 363,000 shares of the Company's 6.50 Series A Convertible Perpetual Preferred Stock (the "Preferred Stock") from Mario Investments, LLC, the sole holder of the Preferred Stock. On October 29, 2024, the Company repurchased the Preferred Stock for a total payment of 361 million, representing approximately 99.5 of the liquidation preference of the preferred stock, and paid the holder accrued dividends of 4 million. The Preferred Stock was then retired. 
 
 New Term Loan 
 
 The Company s new Term Loan has an original principal amount of 350 million, which amortizes in equal quarterly installments of 1 per year with the balance payable in October 2031, when the facility matures. The Term Loan was issued at an original issue discount of 99.5 . 
 
 Interest rate . The Term Loan accrues interest at a margin plus either Term SOFR or a base rate, depending on the Company s election at the time of a loan. For loans incurring interest based on Term SOFR, the margin is (a) 350 basis points if either or both of the ratings (i) by Moody s Investors Service, Inc. Moody s is B2, or lower, or (ii) by Standard Poor s Ratings Services S P is B, or lower, and (b) 325 basis points if either or both of the ratings (i) by Moody s is B1, or better, or (ii) by S P is B+, or better. For loans incurring interest based on the base rate, the margin is (a) 250 basis points if either or both of the ratings (i) by Moody s is B2, or lower, or (ii) by S P is B, or lower, and (b) 225 basis points if either or both of the ratings (i) by Moody s is B1, or better, or (ii) by S P is B+, or better. The Term Loan provides certain provisions if ratings are unavailable. 
 
 Facility Size Increases . The Term Loan allows for incremental increases in facility size up to an aggregate amount equal to the greater of 225 million and 100 of Consolidated EBITDA for the most recent trailing four consecutive fiscal quarters then ended, plus an additional amount such that the Company s first lien leverage ratio (as defined under the Term Loan) would not exceed 3.75 to 1.00. 
 
 Security. MRC Global (US) Inc. is the borrower under the Term Loan facility, which is guaranteed by MRC Global Inc. and certain of its wholly owned U.S. subsidiaries. The Term Loan is secured by a second lien on the assets of MRC Global Inc., MRC Global (US) Inc. and those U.S. subsidiaries guaranteeing the Term Loan facility (collectively, the "Term Loan Credit Parties") securing our Global ABL Facility (which includes accounts receivable and inventory). The Term Loan is secured by a first lien on substantially all of the other assets of the Term Loan Credit Parities. The Term Loan is further secured by a first lien pledge of all of the capital stock of certain of the direct domestic subsidiaries of Term Loan Credit Parties and 65 of the capital stock of certain of the direct, non-U.S. subsidiaries of the Term Loan Credit Parties. 
 
 Prepayments. We are required to repay the Term Loan with the proceeds from certain asset sales and certain insurance proceeds. In addition, on an annual basis, we are required to repay an amount equal to 50 of excess cash flow, as defined in the Term Loan, reducing to 25 if our first lien leverage ratio is no more than 3.2 5 to 1.00 but greater than 3.00 to 1.00. No payment of excess cash flow is required if the first lien leverage ratio is less than or equal to 3.00 to 1.00. The amount of cash used in the determination of the first lien secured leverage ratio is limited to 125 million.

Restrictive Covenants. The Term Loan does not include any financial maintenance covenants. 
 
 The Term Loan contains restrictive covenants (in each case, subject to exclusions) that limit, among other things, the ability of the Company and its restricted subsidiaries to: 

make investments, including acquisitions; 

prepay certain indebtedness; 

grant liens; 

incur additional indebtedness; 

sell assets; 

make fundamental changes to our business; 

enter into transactions with affiliates; and 

pay dividends. 

The Term Loan also contains other customary restrictive covenants. The covenants are subject to various baskets and materiality thresholds, with certain of the baskets permitted by the restrictions on the repayment of subordinated indebtedness, restricted payments and investments being available only when the various leverage ratio calculations of the Company and its restricted subsidiaries is less than 3.75 to 1.00 or 3.50 to 1.00, as applicable . 
 
 The Term Loan provides that the Company and its restricted subsidiaries may incur any first lien indebtedness that is pari passu to the Term Loan so long as the pro forma first lien secured leverage ratio of the Company and its restricted subsidiaries is less than or equal to 3.75 to 1.00. The Company and its restricted subsidiaries may incur any second lien indebtedness so long as the pro forma junior secured leverage ratio of the Company and its restricted subsidiaries is less than or equal to 4.50 to 1.00. The Company and its restricted subsidiaries may incur any unsecured indebtedness so long as the total leverage ratio of the Company and its restricted subsidiaries is less than or equal to 4.75 to 1.00 or the pro forma consolidated interest coverage ratio of the Company and its restricted subsidiaries is greater than or equal to 2.00 to 1.00. Additionally, under the Term Loan, the Company and its restricted subsidiaries may incur indebtedness under the Global ABL Facility (or any replacement facility) in an amount not to exceed the greater of 1.3 billion and the borrowing base under the Global ABL Facility at such time. 
 
 The Term Loan contains certain customary representations and warranties, affirmative covenants and events of default, including, among other things, payment defaults, breaches of representations and warranties, covenant defaults, cross-defaults to certain indebtedness, certain events of bankruptcy, certain events under ERISA, judgment defaults, actual or asserted failure of any material guaranty or security documents supporting the Term Loan to be in full force and effect and change of control. If such an event of default occurs, the Agent under the Term Loan is entitled to take various actions, including the acceleration of amounts due under the Term Loan and all other actions that a secured creditor is permitted to take following a default. On October 15, 2024, Moody's upgraded the Company's corporate family rating to 'B1' from 'B2' with a stable outlook. Moody's based its ratings upgrade, in part, on the Company's moderate leverage and ample interest coverage, modest capital spending requirements and solid operating performance. Moody's affirmed the outlook as 'stable' based on their view that the Company's performance will remain strong and continue to generate positive free cash flow, and the Company's credit metrics will remain robust. In addition, S P affirmed the Company's issuer-credit rating of 'B' with a stable outlook. 
 
 Our primary sources of liquidity consist of cash generated from our operating activities, existing cash balances and borrowings under our Global ABL Facility. Our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from our operating activities will continue to be primarily dependent on our sales of products and services to our customers at margins sufficient to cover our fixed and variable expenses. At September 30, 2024, our total liquidity, consisting of cash on hand and amounts available under our Global ABL Facility, was 547 million. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had cash of 62 million and 131 million, respectively, a significant portion of which was maintained in the accounts of our various foreign subsidiaries and, if transferred among countries or repatriated to the U.S., may be subject to additional tax liabilities, which would be recognized in our financial statements in the period during which the transfer decision was made.

We believe our sources of liquidity will be sufficient to satisfy the anticipated cash requirements associated with our existing operations for the foreseeable future. However, our future cash requirements could be higher than we currently expect as a result of various factors. Additionally, our ability to generate sufficient cash from our operating activities depends on our future performance, which is subject to general economic, political, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. We may, from time to time, seek to raise additional debt or equity financing or re-price or refinance existing debt in the public or private markets, based on market conditions. Any such capital markets activities would be subject to market conditions, reaching final agreement with lenders or investors, and other factors, and there can be no assurance that we would successfully consummate any such transactions. 
 
 Cash Flows 
 
 The following table sets forth our cash flows for the periods indicated below (in millions):

Operating Activities 
 
 Net cash provided by operating activities was 197 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 92 million provided during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The change in operating cash flows was primarily the result of a more efficient use of our working capital as we reduced inventory purchasing, improved collections on our receivables and managed our payables. 
 
 Investing Activities 
 
 Net cash used in inv esting activities comprised of capital expenditures totaling 23 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily related to the replacement of our North American enterprise resource planning system, compared to 10 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Financing Activities 
 
 Net cash used in fi nancing activities was 242 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 58 million used in financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The change is primarily due to payments on debt obligations of 295 million, offset by net proceeds on revolving credit facilities of 76 million in the first nine months of 2024 compared to 33 million net payments from revolving credit facilities in the first nine months of 2023. We used 18 million to pay dividends on preferred stock for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies 
 
 The preparation of financial statements, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expense in the financial statements. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and other assumptions, which it believes are reasonable. If actual amounts are ultimately different from these estimates, the revisions are included in our results of operations for the period in which the actual amounts become known. 
 
 Accounting policies are considered critical when they require management to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimates are made and when there are different estimates that management reasonably could have made, which would have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition, changes in our financial condition or results of operations. For a description of our critical accounting policies, see Item 7: Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 
 We are primarily exposed to the market risk associated with unfavorable movements in interest rates, foreign currencies and steel price volatility. There have been no material changes to ou r market risk policies or our market risk sensitive instruments and positions as described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 
 Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures . 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we have reviewed, under the direction of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the Company s disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e). Based upon and as of the date of that review, the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that the Company files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. 
 
 Changes in internal control over financial reporting . 
 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the third quarter of 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Part II other information 
 
 ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
 
 From time to time, we have been subject to various claims and involved in legal proceedings incidental to the nature of our businesses. We maintain insurance coverage to reduce financial risk associated with certain of these claims and proceedings. It is not possible to predict the outcome of these claims and proceedings. However, in our opinion, there are no pending legal proceedings that are likely to have a material effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows, although it is possible that the resolution of certain actual, threatened or anticipated claims or proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period of resolution. 
 
 Also, from time to time, in the ordinary course of our business, our customers may claim that the products that we distribute are either defective or require repair or replacement under warranties that either we or the manufacturer may provide to the customer. These proceedings are, in the opinion of management, ordinary and routine matters incidental to our normal business. Our purchase orders with our suppliers generally require the manufacturer to indemnify us against any product liability claims, leaving the manufacturer ultimately responsible for these claims. In many cases, state, provincial or foreign law provides protection to distributors for these sorts of claims, shifting the responsibility to the manufacturer. In some cases, we could be required to repair or replace the products for the benefit of our customer and seek recovery from the manufacturer for our expense. In the opinion of management, the ultimate disposition of these claims and proceedings is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 
 
 For information regarding asbestos cases in which we are a defendant and other claims and proceedings, see Note 10-Commitments and Contingencies to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 
 We are affected by risks specific to us as well as factors that affect all businesses operating in a global market. The significant factors known to us that could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or operating results are described in Part I, Item 2 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 under Risk Factors . 
 
 Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds 
 
 None. 
 
 Item 3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities 
 
 None. 
 
 Item 4. MINING SAFETY DISCLOSURES 
 
 None. 

Item 5. Other Information 
 
 During the quarter ended September 30, 2024 , no director or executive officer of the Company adopted or terminated a "Rule 10b5 - 1 trading arrangement" or "non-Rule 10b5 - 1 trading arrangement," as each term is defined in Item 408 (a) of Regulation S-K.
