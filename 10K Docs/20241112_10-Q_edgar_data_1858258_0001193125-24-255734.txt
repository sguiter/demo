In some cases, you can identify such forward-looking statements by terminology such as may, should, could, expect, plan, anticipate, believe, estimate, predict, potential or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology. All statements (other than statements of historical fact) included in this report that address activities, events or developments that may occur in the future, including such matters as changes in commodity prices and market conditions (for gold and the Shares), the Fund s operations, the Sponsor s plans and references to the Fund s future success and other similar matters are forward-looking statements. These statements are only predictions. Actual events or results may differ materially. These statements are based upon certain assumptions and analyses made by the Sponsor on the basis of its perception of historical trends, current conditions and expected future developments, as well as other factors it believes are appropriate in the circumstances. Whether or not actual results and developments will conform to the Sponsor s expectations and predictions, however, is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including the special considerations discussed in this report, general economic, market and business conditions, changes in laws or regulations, including those concerning taxes, made by governmental authorities or regulatory bodies, and other world economic and political developments. All forward-looking statements made in this report are qualified by these cautionary statements, and there can be no assurance that the actual results or developments the Sponsor anticipates will be realized or, even if substantially realized, will result in the expected consequences to, or have the expected effects on, the Fund s operations or the value of the Shares. None of the Trust, the Fund, the Sponsor, or the Trustee or their respective affiliates is under a duty to update any of the forward-looking statements to conform such statements to actual results or to a change in the Sponsor s expectations or predictions.

Organization and Trust Overview The Franklin Templeton Holdings Trust (the Trust was organized as a Delaware statutory trust on April 19, 2021. Franklin Holdings, LLC is the Sponsor of the Trust (the Sponsor ). The Trust currently offers a single series, the Franklin Responsibly Sourced Gold ETF (the Fund ). The Fund issues common units of beneficial interest Shares ), which represent units of fractional undivided beneficial interest in and ownership of the Fund. The Shares are listed on NYSE Arca, Inc. NYSE Arca under the symbol FGDL. Shares are not obligations of, and are not guaranteed by, the Sponsor or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates. The investment objective of the Fund is for the Shares to reflect the performance of the price of gold bullion, less the Fund s expenses. The assets of the Fund include only gold bullion and cash, if any. The Fund seeks to hold only responsibly sourced gold in the Fund s allocated account. The Fund defines responsibly sourced gold for this purpose as London Good Delivery gold bullion bars that were refined on or after January 1, 2012 (also referred to herein as post-2012 gold ). All post-2012 gold has been refined in accordance with London Bullion Market Association s LBMA Responsible Gold Guidance (the Gold Guidance ), described further herein. To facilitate this, in transferring gold into and out of the Fund s allocated account, the Custodian will, on a best efforts basis and subject to available liquidity, seek to allocate post-2012 gold. If, due to a lack of liquidity, the Custodian is unable to allocate post-2012 gold to the Fund s allocated account, the Custodian will do so as soon as reasonably practicable. The Fund issues Shares on a continuous basis. Shares are issued by the Fund only in one or more blocks of 50,000 Shares (a block of 50,000 Shares is called a Creation Unit in exchange for gold from Authorized Participants, which is then allocated to the Fund and stored safely by the Custodian. The Fund issues and redeems Creation Units on an ongoing basis at Net Asset Value to Authorized Participants who have entered into an agreement with the Sponsor and the Administrator. The Fund pays the Sponsor a fee that accrues daily at an annualized rate equal to 0.15 of the daily Net Asset Value of the Fund, paid monthly in arrears (the Sponsor Fee ). The Sponsor Fee is accrued in and payable in U.S. dollars. The NAV is computed based upon the total value of the assets of the Fund (i.e., gold and cash) less its liabilities. To determine the Fund s NAV, the Administrator generally will value the gold bullion held by the Fund on the basis of the LBMA Gold Price PM as published by the IBA. IBA operates electronic auctions for spot, unallocated loco London gold, providing a market-based platform for buyers and sellers to trade. The auctions are run at 10:30 a.m. and 3:00 p.m. London time for gold. The final auction prices are published to the market as the LBMA Gold Price AM and the LBMA Gold Price PM, respectively. The Administrator will calculate the NAV on each day NYSE Arca is open for regular trading, at 12:00 PM New York time. If no LBMA Gold Price (AM or PM) is made on a particular evaluation day or if the LBMA Gold Price PM has not been announced by 12:00 PM New York time on a particular evaluation day, the next most recent LBMA Gold Price AM or PM will be used in the determination of the NAV, unless the Sponsor determines that such price is inappropriate to use as the basis for such determination. If the Sponsor determines that such price is inappropriate to use, it shall identify an alternate basis for evaluation of the gold bullion held by the Fund that the Sponsor determines fairly represents the commercial value of the Fund s gold bullion. Once the value of the gold bullion has been determined, the Administrator subtracts all estimated accrued expenses and other liabilities of the Fund from the total value of the gold bullion and any cash of the Fund. The resulting figure is the NAV. The Administrator determines the NAV per Share by dividing the NAV of the Fund by the number of Shares outstanding as of the close of trading on NYSE Arca. Critical Accounting Policy The financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements relies on estimates and assumptions that impact the Fund s as well as the Trust s financial position and results of operations. These estimates and assumptions affect the Fund s as well as the Trust s application of accounting policies. Below we describe the valuation of gold bullion, a critical accounting policy that we believe is important to understanding the results of operations and financial position. In addition, please refer to Note 2 to the Financial Statements for further discussion of the accounting policies followed by the Fund and the Trust. The gold bullion held on behalf of the Fund at the vaults of the Gold Custodian is audited each year generally coinciding with the Fund s financial year end at March 31. On April 2, 2024, Bureau Veritas Commodities UK LTD concluded the audit inspection procedures with respect to the Fund s gold bullion held by the Gold Custodian. The audit findings did not identify non-conformities. Results of Operations At September 30, 2024, the Custodian held 32,699.485 ounces of gold on behalf of the Fund in its vault, with a market value of 85,998,011 (cost: 62,561,734) based on the LBMA Gold Price PM at period end.

Liquidity and Capital Resources The Fund is not aware of any trends, demands, commitments, events or uncertainties that are reasonably likely to result in material changes to its liquidity needs. The Fund s only ordinary recurring expense is the fee paid to the Sponsor at an annual rate of 0.15 of the daily net asset value of the Fund. The Sponsor s annual fee accrues daily and is payable by the Fund monthly in arrears. In exchange for the Sponsor s fee, the Sponsor has agreed to assume the ordinary fees and expenses incurred by the Fund, including but not limited to the following: fees charged by the Administrator, the Custodian and the Trustee, NYSE Arca listing fees, typical maintenance and transaction fees of the DTC, SEC registration fees, printing and mailing costs, audit fees and expenses and up to 500,000 per annum in legal fees and expenses and applicable license fees. The Sponsor may determine in its sole discretion to assume legal fees and expenses of the Fund in excess of the 500,000 per annum stipulated in the Sponsor Agreement. The Sponsor is not required to pay any extraordinary or non-routine expenses. Extraordinary expenses are fees and expenses which are unexpected or unusual in nature, such as legal claims and liabilities and litigation costs or indemnification or other unanticipated expenses. Extraordinary fees and expenses also include material expenses which are not currently anticipated obligations of the Fund. The Fund will be responsible for the payment of such expenses to the extent any such expenses are incurred. Routine operational, administrative and other ordinary expenses are not deemed extraordinary expenses. The Fund will sell gold on an as-needed basis to pay the Sponsor s fee. The Administrator will, at the direction of the Sponsor, sell the Fund s gold as necessary to pay the Fund s expenses not otherwise assumed by the Sponsor. When selling gold to pay the Sponsor s fee and other expenses, if any, the Administrator endeavors to sell the exact amount of gold needed to pay expenses to minimize the Fund s holdings of cash.
