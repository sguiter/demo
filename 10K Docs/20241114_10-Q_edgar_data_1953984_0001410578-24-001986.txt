 Key Performance Metrics and Non-GAAP Financial Measures We focus on several key metrics in evaluating the success of our business relationships and our resulting financial position and operating performance. Our key metrics of Gross Profit and EBITDA are non-GAAP financial measures. Our management periodically uses certain non-GAAP financial measures, as such term is defined under the rules of the SEC, to supplement our financial information presented in accordance with GAAP and to clarify and enhance understanding of past performance and prospects for the future. Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company s operating performance, financial position or cash flows that excludes or includes amounts that are included in or excluded from the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. Management believes that the non-GAAP financial measures of Gross Profit and EBITDA provide investors and analysts useful insight into our financial position and operating performance. Any non-GAAP measure provided should be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative to, the most directly comparable measure determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Further, the calculation of these non-GAAP financial measures may differ from the calculation of similarly titled financial measures presented by other companies and therefore may not be comparable among companies. Gross profit is defined as total revenue less commissions paid to financial advisors and registered representatives and other fees that generate the revenue. We consider our gross profit amounts to be non-GAAP financial measures that may not be comparable to those of others in our industry. We believe that gross profit amounts can provide investors with useful insight into our core operating performance before other costs that are general and administrative in nature. EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure defined as net income plus interest expense, provision for income taxes, and depreciation and amortization. The Company presents EBITDA because management believes that it can be a useful financial metric in understanding the Company s earnings from operations. EBITDA is not a measure of the Company s financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net income or any other performance measure derived in accordance with GAAP.

According to the most recent estimate from the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, the U.S. economy grew at an annualized pace of 2.8 in the third quarter of 2024, after growing at an annualized pace of 1.6 and 2.8 in the first and second quarter of this year, respectively. The U.S. economy added roughly 558,000 jobs in the third quarter of 2024, while the unemployment rate averaged 4.1 in the third quarter of 2024, consistent with the average in the prior quarter. Our business is also sensitive to current and expected short-term interest rates, which are largely driven by Fed policy. During the third quarter of 2024, Fed policymakers lowered the target range for the federal funds rate to 4.8 to 5.0 . The equity markets surged to new highs resulting in the S P 500 returning 5.9 during the third quarter of 2024.

We also generate interest income in accordance with our agreements with our clearing partners. In accordance with ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, we record revenue when control of the promised services is transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those services. Revenues are analyzed to determine whether the Company is the principal (i.e., reports revenues on a gross basis) or agent (i.e., reports revenues on a net basis) in the contract. Principal or agent designations depend primarily on the control an entity has over the product or service before control is transferred to a customer. The indicators of which party exercises control include primary responsibility over performance obligations, inventory risk before the good or service is transferred and discretion in establishing the price. Commissions Commission revenues represent sales commissions generated by advisors for their clients purchases and sales of securities on exchanges and over-the-counter, as well as purchases of other investment products.

Table of Contents 
 The Company generates two types of commission revenues: sales-based commissions that are recognized at the point of sale on the trade date and trailing commissions that are recognized over time as earned. Sales-based commission revenues vary by investment product and are recognized on the trade date or the transaction date, which represents the completion of the Company s performance obligation because that is when the underlying financial instrument or purchaser is identified, the pricing is agreed upon, and the risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to/from the customer at a point in time. The rates at which commissions are charged to the customers range from 1 to 7 based on the investment product. Trailing commission revenues which are preliminarily related to the sales of mutual funds and variable annuities held by clients of the Company s advisors are generally based on a percentage of the current market value of clients investment holdings in trail-eligible assets, and are recognized over the time the client owns the investment or holds the contract and is generally based on a fixed rate applied, generally twenty-five to fifty basis points (25-50 bps) of the current market value of the clients holdings. Trailing commissions are generally received monthly or quarterly. The ongoing revenue is not recognized at the time of sale because it is variably constrained due to factors outside the Company s control including market volatility and the client s investment hold period and the Company does not believe that it can overcome such constraints until the market value of the fund and the investor activities are known. The revenues will not be recognized until it is probable that a significant reversal will not occur. The Company is principal for the commission revenue, as it is responsible for the execution of the clients purchases and sales and maintains relationships with the product sponsors. Advisors assist the Company in performing it obligations. Accordingly, total commission revenue is reported on a gross basis. See Note 4 - Revenues From Contracts with Customers within the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, and 2023 for further details regarding our commission revenue by product category. The following tables sets forth the components of our commission revenue for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands): 

For the three months ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change Change Sales-based 16,441 18,939 (2,498) -13.2 Trailing 18,339 16,530 1,807 10.9 Total commission revenue 34,780 35,469 (691) -1.9

Trailing based revenue increased by approximately 1.8 and 6.8 million or 10.9 and 14.3 for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to 2023. The decrease in sales-based revenue for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 2023 is attributable to a decrease in the generation of transactional based products. The increase in the trailing based revenues is primarily due to the positive market performance related to the trail-eligible assets. Commission revenue is generated from brokerage assets. The following tables summarize the brokerage assets as of September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in billions):

 Advisory Fees Advisory fees represent fees charged to advisors clients accounts on the Company s corporate advisory platform.

 Interest and other income Interest income includes amounts earned on balances held at the Company s clearing brokers related to cash balances and margin balances. The Company s clearing agreements include provisions that provide for a sharing of the interest income earned on such balances with the clearing brokers. The rate varies based on the clearing broker.

Certain of the technology, insurance and regulatory costs are passed through to the financial advisors and any excess costs are included as fees within commissions and fees. The commissions and fees paid to the financial advisors are based on the advisory and commission revenue earned on each client s account. The payout amount is production based, which is the gross revenue produced by the financial advisor, and varies based on the level of such production ranging from 50 to 95 of the revenue generated. The production levels begin at gross revenue of 15,000 up to 4,000,000 and up, and the payout rate starts at 50 and increases to a top payout rate of 94 for annual production of 4,000,000 and up.

 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Although these estimates are based on the 

 32 

Table of Contents 
 Company s knowledge of current events and actions the Company may undertake in the future, actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions. We define our critical accounting policies and estimates as those that require us to make subjective judgments about matters that are uncertain and are likely to have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations as well as the specific manner in which we apply those principles. We believe the critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements which require significant estimates and judgments are as follows: Revenue Recognition Revenues from contracts with customers are recognized when control of the promised services is transferred to customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those services. Management exercises judgment in determining whether the Company is the principal (i.e., reports revenues on a gross basis) or agent (i.e., reports revenue on a net basis). For additional information see Note 4 in the consolidated financial statements as of and for the three and nine-months periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Goodwill and other intangible assets are tested annually for impairment or if certain events occur indicating that the carrying amounts may be impaired. We have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If, after assessing the totality of events or circumstances, we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount, then performing the two-step impairment test is not required. However, if we conclude otherwise, we are then required to perform the first step of the two-step impairment test. Goodwill impairment is determined by comparing the estimated fair value of a reporting unit with its respective carrying value. If the estimated fair value exceeds the carrying value, goodwill at the reporting unit level is not deemed to be impaired. If the estimated fair value is below carrying value, however, further analysis is required to determine the amount of the impairment. Additionally, if the carrying value of a reporting unit is zero or a negative value and it is determined that it is more likely than not the goodwill is impaired, further analysis is required. The estimated fair values of the reporting units are derived based on valuation techniques we believe market participants would use for each of the reporting units. We performed our goodwill impairment test as of and for the years ended December 31, 2023, and 2022. The estimated fair value of the reporting units were determined using the market approach for each reporting unit, relying specifically on the guideline public company method. Our guideline public company method incorporates revenue and earnings multiples from publicly traded companies with operations and other characteristics similar to each reporting unit. As a result of the 2023 and 2022 annual impairment tests, the fair value of the reporting units was 257 and 266 greater than its carrying value, respectively. Since there have been no events or circumstances which indicated that it was more likely than not the fair value of the reporting units were below their carrying amount, interim goodwill tests were not considered necessary. The goodwill impairment test requires us to make judgments in determining what assumptions to use in the calculation. Assumptions, judgments, and estimates about future cash flows and discount rates are complex and often subjective. They can be affected by a variety of factors, including, among others, economic trends and market conditions, changes in revenue growth trends or business strategies, unanticipated competition, discount rates, technology, or government regulations. In assessing the fair value of our reporting units, the volatile nature of the securities markets and industry requires us to consider the business and market cycle and assess the stage of the cycle in estimating the timing and extent of future cash flows. In addition to discounted cash flows, we consider other information, such as public market comparable and multiples of recent mergers and acquisitions of similar businesses. Although we believe the assumptions, judgments, and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate, different assumptions, judgments, and estimates could materially affect our reported financial results. Intangible assets that are deemed to have definite lives are amortized over their useful lives, generally ranging from 5 to 10 years. They are reviewed for impairment when there is evidence that events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by comparing the carrying amount to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the estimated fair value.

 Contingent Liabilities The Company recognizes liabilities for contingencies when there is an exposure that, when fully analyzed, indicates potential losses become probable and can be reasonably estimated. Whether a potential loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated is based on currently available information and is subject to significant judgment, a variety of assumptions and uncertainties. When a potential loss is probable and the loss or range of loss can be estimated, the Company will accrue the most likely amount within that range. No liability is recognized for those matters which, in management s judgment, the determination of a reasonable estimate of potential loss is not possible, or for which a potential loss is not determined to be probable.

No interest shall accrue for the benefit of the holders of shares of Preferred Stock to be redeemed on any cash so set aside by the Corporation. Subject to applicable escheat laws, any such cash unclaimed at the end of two (2) years from the Redemption Date shall revert to the general funds 

 of the Corporation, after which reversion the holders of such Shares so called for redemption shall look only to the general funds of the Corporation for the payment of such cash. (c) As promptly as practicable after the surrender or delivery in accordance with said notice of any such shares of Preferred Stock so redeemed (properly endorsed or assigned for transfer, if the Corporation shall so require and if the notice shall so state, or, in the case of shares of Preferred Stock held in book-entry form through a depositary, upon delivery of such shares in accordance with such notice and the procedures of such depositary), such shares of Preferred Stock shall be exchanged for any cash (without interest thereon) for which such shares of Preferred Stock have been redeemed. (d) The deposit of funds with a bank or trust company for the purpose of redeeming shares of Preferred Stock shall be irrevocable except that: (i) the Corporation shall be entitled to receive from such bank or trust company the interest or other earnings, if any, earned on any money so deposited in trust, and the holders of any shares redeemed shall have no claim to such interest or other earnings; and (ii) any balance of monies so deposited by the Corporation and unclaimed by the holders of the shares of Preferred Stock entitled thereto at the expiration of two (2) years from the applicable redemption date shall be repaid, together with any interest or other earnings thereon, to the Corporation, and after any such repayment, the holders of the shares entitled to the funds so repaid to the Corporation shall look only to the Corporation for payment of the redemption price without interest or other earnings. 
 (e) Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, the Corporation may not effect any redemption of the Preferred Stock pursuant to this Section 6 while any shares of Series A Convertible Stock remain outstanding. Section 7. Conversion . (a) Each share of Preferred Stock shall be convertible, in whole or in part, at any time and from time to time from and after the Funding Date and prior to their redemption, at the option of the Holder thereof, at a rate equal to the quotient of (i) 10.00, divided by (ii) the product of (A) .80 multiplied by, (B) the volume weighted average price for the 20 trading days during the 30-day period immediately prior to such conversion , provided that in no event shall the denominator be less than 6.00 per share (the Conversion Rate ).

The Corporation shall deliver the Conversion Shares electronically through the Depository Trust Corporation or another established clearing corporation performing similar functions. As used herein, Standard Settlement Period means the standard settlement period, expressed in a number of Trading Days, on the Corporation s primary Trading Market with respect to the Common Stock as in effect on the date of delivery of the Notice of Conversion, but in no event earlier than one (1) Trading Day after each Conversion Date.

(ii) If, in the case of any Notice of Conversion, such Conversion Shares are not delivered to or as directed by the applicable Holder by the Share Delivery Date, the Holder shall be entitled to elect by written notice to the Corporation at any time on or before its receipt of such Conversion Shares, to rescind such Conversion, in which event the Corporation shall promptly return to the Holder any original Preferred Stock certificate delivered to the Corporation and the Holder shall promptly return to the Corporation the Conversion Shares issued to such Holder pursuant to the rescinded Notice of Conversion. (iii) The Corporation s obligation to issue and deliver the Conversion Shares upon conversion of Preferred Stock in accordance with the terms hereof are absolute and unconditional, irrespective of any action or inaction by a Holder to enforce the same, any waiver or consent with respect to any provision hereof, the recovery of any judgment against any Person or any action to enforce the same, or any setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, limitation or termination, or any breach or alleged breach by such Holder or any other Person of any obligation to the Corporation or any violation or alleged violation of law by such Holder or any other person, and irrespective of any other circumstance which might otherwise limit such obligation of the Corporation to such Holder in connection with the issuance of such Conversion Shares; provided , however , that such delivery shall not operate as a waiver by the Corporation of any such action that the Corporation may have against such Holder. (iv) The Corporation covenants that it will at all times reserve and keep available out of its authorized and unissued shares of Common Stock for the sole purpose of issuance upon conversion of the Preferred Stock and payment of dividends on the Preferred Stock, each as provided herein, free from preemptive rights or any other actual contingent purchase rights of Persons other than the Holder (and the other holders of the Preferred Stock), not less than such aggregate number of shares of the Common Stock as shall (subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Purchase Agreement) be issuable (taking into account the adjustments and restrictions of Section 7) upon the conversion of the then outstanding shares of Preferred Stock and payment of dividends hereunder. The Corporation covenants that all shares of Common Stock that shall be so issuable shall, upon issue, be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable. 

 (v) No fractional shares or scrip representing fractional shares shall be issued upon the conversion of the Preferred Stock. As to any fraction of a share which the Holder would otherwise be entitled to purchase upon such conversion, the Corporation shall at its election, either pay a cash adjustment in respect of such final fraction in an amount equal to such fraction multiplied by the Conversion Rate or round up to the next whole share. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, but consistent with the provisions of this subsection with respect to fractional Conversion Shares, nothing shall prevent any Holder from converting fractional shares of Preferred Stock. (vi) The issuance of Conversion Shares on conversion of this Preferred Stock shall be made without charge to any Holder for any documentary stamp or similar taxes that may be payable in respect of the issue or delivery of such Conversion Shares, provided that the Corporation shall not be required to pay any tax that may be payable in respect of any transfer involved in the issuance and delivery of any such Conversion Shares upon conversion in a name other than that of the Holders of such shares of Preferred Stock and the Corporation shall not be required to issue or deliver such Conversion Shares unless or until the Person or Persons requesting the issuance thereof shall have paid to the Corporation the amount of such tax or shall have established to the satisfaction of the Corporation that such tax has been paid.

If holders of Common Stock are given any choice as to the securities, cash or property to be received in such Fundamental Transaction, then each Holder shall be given the same choice as to the Reference Property Unit it receives upon any conversion of the Preferred Stock following such Fundamental Transaction. To the extent necessary to effectuate the foregoing provisions, any successor to the Corporation or surviving entity in such Fundamental Transaction shall file a new Certificate of Designation with the same terms and conditions and issue to the Holders new preferred stock consistent with the foregoing provisions and evidencing the Holders right to convert such preferred stock into Reference Property Units.

 this Section 7(c) pursuant to written agreements in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Holders and approved by the Holders (without unreasonable delay) prior to such Fundamental Transaction and shall, at the option of the Holders, deliver to the Holder in exchange for the Preferred Stock a security of the Successor Entity evidenced by a written instrument substantially similar in form and substance to the Preferred Stock which is convertible in accordance with this Section 7(c), and which is reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to the Holders. Upon the occurrence of any such Fundamental Transaction, the Successor Entity shall succeed to, and, except in the case of a lease, be substituted for (so that from and after the date of such Fundamental Transaction, the provisions of this Certificate of Designation and the other Transaction Documents referring to the Corporation shall refer instead to the Successor Entity), and may exercise every right and power of the Corporation and shall assume all of the obligations of the Corporation under this Certificate of Designation and the other Transaction Documents with the same effect as if such Successor Entity had been named as the Corporation herein.

(pursuant to Section 151 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware) Binah Capital Group, Inc., a corporation organized and existing under the laws of the State of Delaware (the Corporation ), in accordance with the provisions of Section 151 thereof, hereby certifies that the Board of Directors of the Corporation (the Board ), in accordance with the provisions of the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation and applicable law duly adopted resolutions creating a series of shares of Preferred Stock of the Corporation with the designation and number of shares of such series, and the voting and other powers, preferences and relative, participating, optional or other rights, and the qualifications, limitations and restrictions, of the shares of such series, as follows: Section 1. Designation and Number . There is hereby created out of the authorized and unissued shares of Preferred Stock of the Corporation a series of Preferred Stock designated as the Series B Junior Convertible Participating Preferred Stock, par value 0.0001 per share (the Preferred Stock ), and the authorized number of shares constituting such series shall be 500,000. Each share of Preferred Stock shall have a stated value equal to 10.00 per share, subject to increase set forth in section 3 below (the Stated Value Section 2. Ranking . Each share of Preferred Stock shall rank equally in all respects and shall be subject to the provisions herein. The Preferred Stock shall, with respect to payment of dividends, redemption payments, and rights (including as to the distribution of assets) upon Liquidation, rank senior and prior to the Corporation s Junior Stock. The Preferred Stock shall rank junior to all of the Corporation s Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, indebtedness and other liabilities. Section 3. Dividends . (a) Subject to the prior and superior right of the Holders of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, Holders shall be entitled to receive, and the Corporation shall pay, cumulative dividends at the rate per share (as a percentage of the Stated Value per share) of seven percent (7 per annum , payable and compounded quarterly on the last day of each calendar quarter, beginning on the first such date after the Funding Date, on each Conversion Date (with respect only to Preferred Stock being converted) and on each Redemption Date (with respect only to Preferred Stock being redeemed) (each such date, a Dividend Payment Date (if any Dividend Payment Date is not a Trading Day, the applicable payment shall be due on the next succeeding Trading Day) in cash, or at the Corporation s option, up to 50 of the amount due, in duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable shares of Preferred Stock Dividend Shares or a combination thereof. For purposes hereof, each Dividend Share shall be deemed 

 to have a value of 10.00 per share. The Holders shall have the same rights and remedies with respect to the delivery of any such shares as if such shares were being issued pursuant to Section 8. (b) Dividends shall cease to accrue with respect to any Preferred Stock converted, provided that the Corporation actually delivers the Conversion Shares within the time period required by Section 6(c)(i) herein. Except as otherwise provided herein, if at any time the Corporation pays dividends partially in cash and partially in shares, then such payment shall be distributed ratably among the Holders based upon the number of shares of Preferred Stock held by each Holder on such Dividend Payment Date. (c) So long as any Preferred Stock shall remain outstanding, neither the Corporation nor any Subsidiary thereof shall directly or indirectly pay or declare any dividend or make any distribution upon, nor shall any distribution be made in respect of, any Junior Stock, nor shall any monies be set aside for or applied to the purchase or redemption (through a sinking fund or otherwise) of any Junior Stock.

(b) If in any Liquidation the assets available for payment of the Liquidation Preference are insufficient to permit the payment of the full preferential amounts described in Section 4(a)(i) to the holders of the Preferred Stock then all the remaining available assets shall be distributed pro rata among the holders of the then outstanding Preferred Stock in accordance with the respective aggregate Liquidation Preferences. (c) Neither the consolidation or merger of the Corporation into or with another entity nor the dissolution, liquidation, winding up or reorganization of the Corporation immediately followed by the incorporation of another corporation to which such assets are distributed or transferred, nor the sale, lease, transfer or conveyance of all or substantially all of the assets of the Corporation to another entity shall be deemed a Liquidation; provided that, in each case, effective provision is made in the certificate of incorporation of the resulting or surviving entity or otherwise for the preservation and protection of the rights of the Holders on substantially identical terms. Section 5. Voting Rights . (a) In General . Except to the extent otherwise required by applicable Law or expressly set forth in this Section 5 , the Holders will vote together with the Common Stock and not as a separate class, except as required by law, on any matters on which any of the holders of Common Stock are entitled to vote. (b) Authorization of Senior Preferred Shares . Notwithstanding Section 5(a) and for so long as any shares of Preferred Stock remain issued and outstanding, without the affirmative vote of the Holders of a majority of the outstanding voting power of the Preferred Stock, voting together as a single class separate from all other classes or series of capital stock of the Corporation, the Corporation shall not and shall not permit an Subsidiary to authorize or issue Senior Preferred Shares. 

 (c) Amendment or Alteration of Terms of Preferred Stock Notwithstanding Section 5(a) , the affirmative vote of the Holders of a majority of the voting power of the Preferred Stock, voting together as a single class separate from all other classes or series of capital stock of the Corporation, shall be required for the approval of any amendment, alteration or repeal of any provision of this Certificate of Designations (including by merger, operation of Law or otherwise) which adversely affects the rights, preferences, privileges or voting powers of the Preferred Stock; provided , however , that nothing herein contained shall require such vote or approval (i) in connection with any increase in the total number of authorized shares under the Certificate of Incorporation or any authorization, designation or increase of any class or series of shares under the Certificate of Incorporation or (ii) in connection with any consolidation, merger, combination or similar transaction in which the Corporation is the surviving entity which does not adversely affect the rights, preferences, privileges or voting powers of the Preferred Stock. (d) One Vote Per Share. On any matter on which Holders are entitled to vote pursuant to this Section 5 , each Holder will have one (1) vote per share. Section 6. Redemption. (a) The Corporation may, at its option, in whole or in part, redeem the Preferred Stock, anytime after the first anniversary of the Funding Date (the Redemption Date ), by delivery of written notice to each Holder at least sixty (60) days prior the applicable Redemption Date, at a redemption price equal to the greater of (i) 12.00 per share of Preferred Stock, plus accrued but unpaid dividends, or (ii) the product of (A) 1.20 multiplied by (B) the volume weighted average price for 20 trading days during the 30-day period immediately prior to such redemption; provided that such price shall not be greater than 20.00. (b) Notice of the redemption of Preferred Stock under this Section 7 shall be delivered by e-mail to each holder of record of Preferred Stock to be redeemed at the address of each such holder as shown on the Corporation s records, at least sixty (60) days prior the applicable Redemption Date. Neither the failure to e-mail any notice required by this Section 6(b), nor any defect therein or in the e-mailing thereof, to any particular holder, shall affect the sufficiency of the notice or the validity of the proceedings for redemption with respect to the other holders. Any notice which was e-mailed in the manner herein provided shall be conclusively presumed to have been duly given on the date e-mailed whether or not the holder receives the notice. Each such e-mailed notice shall state, as appropriate: (i) the Redemption Date; (ii) if less than all of the shares of Preferred Stock are to be redeemed, the number of shares of Preferred Stock to be redeemed; (iii) the redemption price set forth in Section 5(a); and (iv) the place or places at which certificates, if any, for such shares of Preferred Stock are to be surrendered (or, in the case of shares of Preferred Stock held in book-entry form, the depositary or other facilities of which such shares of Preferred Stock shall be redeemed). Notice having been e-mailed as aforesaid, from and after the Redemption Date (unless the Corporation shall fail to make available an amount of cash necessary to effect such redemption), (x) except as otherwise provided herein, dividends on shares of Preferred Stock so called for redemption shall cease to accrue, (y) said shares of Preferred Stock shall no longer be deemed to be outstanding, and (z) all rights of the holders thereof as holders of shares of Preferred Stock of the Corporation shall cease (except the right to receive cash payable upon such redemption, without interest thereon, upon surrender and endorsement of their certificates if so required or, in the case of shares of Preferred Stock held in book-entry form through a depositary, upon delivery of such shares in accordance with such notice and the procedures of such depositary, and to receive any dividends payable thereon). The Corporation s obligation to provide cash in accordance with the preceding sentence shall be deemed fulfilled if, on or before the Redemption Date, the Corporation shall deposit with a bank or trust company (which may be an affiliate of the Corporation) that has an office in the Borough of Manhattan, City of New York, and that has, or is an affiliate of a bank or trust company that has, capital and surplus of at least 500,000,000, funds necessary for such redemption, in trust, with irrevocable instructions that such cash be applied to the redemption of the shares of Preferred Stock so called for redemption. No 

 interest shall accrue for the benefit of the holders of shares of Preferred Stock to be redeemed on any cash so set aside by the Corporation. Subject to applicable escheat laws, any such cash unclaimed at the end of two (2) years from the Redemption Date shall revert to the general funds of the Corporation, after which reversion the holders of such Shares so called for redemption shall look only to the general funds of the Corporation for the payment of such cash. (c) As promptly as practicable after the surrender or delivery in accordance with said notice of any such shares of Preferred Stock so redeemed (properly endorsed or assigned for transfer, if the Corporation shall so require and if the notice shall so state, or, in the case of shares of Preferred Stock held in book-entry form through a depositary, upon delivery of such shares in accordance with such notice and the procedures of such depositary), such shares of Preferred Stock shall be exchanged for any cash (without interest thereon) for which such shares of Preferred Stock have been redeemed. (d) The deposit of funds with a bank or trust company for the purpose of redeeming shares of Preferred Stock shall be irrevocable except that: (i) the Corporation shall be entitled to receive from such bank or trust company the interest or other earnings, if any, earned on any money so deposited in trust, and the holders of any shares redeemed shall have no claim to such interest or other earnings; and (ii) any balance of monies so deposited by the Corporation and unclaimed by the holders of the shares of Preferred Stock entitled thereto at the expiration of two (2) years from the applicable redemption date shall be repaid, together with any interest or other earnings thereon, to the Corporation, and after any such repayment, the holders of the shares entitled to the funds so repaid to the Corporation shall look only to the Corporation for payment of the redemption price without interest or other earnings. (e) Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, the Corporation may not effect any redemption of the Preferred Stock pursuant to this Section 6 while any shares of Series A Convertible Stock remain outstanding. Section 7. Conversion . (a) Each share of Preferred Stock shall be convertible, in whole or in part, at any time and from time to time from and after the Funding Date and prior to their redemption, at the option of the Holder thereof, at a rate equal to the quotient of (i) 10.00, divided by (ii) the product of (A) .80 multiplied by, (B) the volume weighted average price for the 20 trading days during the 30-day period immediately prior to such conversion, provided that in no event shall the denominator be less than 6.00 per share (the Conversion Rate ). Holders shall effect conversions by providing the Corporation with the form of conversion notice attached hereto as Annex A (a Notice of Conversion ). Each Notice of Conversion shall specify the number of shares of Preferred Stock to be converted, the number of shares of Preferred Stock owned prior to the conversion at issue, the number of shares of Preferred Stock owned subsequent to the conversion at issue and the date on which such conversion is to be effected, which date may not be prior to the date the applicable Holder delivers by e-mail such Notice of Conversion to the Corporation (such date, the Conversion Date ). If no Conversion Date is specified in a Notice of Conversion, the Conversion Date shall be the date such Notice of Conversion to the Corporation is deemed delivered hereunder. Upon delivery of the Notice of Conversion by a Holder, such Holder shall be deemed for all corporate purposes to have become the holder of record of the Conversion Shares with respect to which the Preferred Stock has been converted, irrespective of date of delivery of such Conversion Shares. No ink-original Notice of Conversion shall be required, nor shall any medallion guarantee (or other type of guarantee or notarization) of any Notice of Conversion form be required. The calculations and entries set forth in the Notice of Conversion shall control in the absence of manifest or mathematical error. Shares of Preferred 

 Stock converted into Common Stock or redeemed in accordance with the terms hereof shall be canceled and shall not be reissued. In addition, all of the outstanding shares of Preferred Stock shall mandatorily and automatically convert into shares of Common Stock in accordance with this Section 7 upon the affirmative vote of a majority of the issued and outstanding shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock and Preferred Stock voting as a single class. (b) Mechanics of Conversion. (i) Not later than the earlier of (i) two (2) Trading Days and (ii) the number of Trading Days comprising the Standard Settlement Period (as defined below) after each Conversion Date (the Share Delivery Date ), the Corporation shall deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the converting Holder (A) the number of Conversion Shares being acquired upon the conversion of the Preferred Stock and (B) at the option of the holder (ii) the number of Dividend Shares or (ii) cash, in each case, in the amount of accrued and unpaid dividends on the shares of Preferred Stock subject to conversion. The Corporation shall deliver the Conversion Shares electronically through the Depository Trust Corporation or another established clearing corporation performing similar functions. As used herein, Standard Settlement Period means the standard settlement period, expressed in a number of Trading Days, on the Corporation s primary Trading Market with respect to the Common Stock as in effect on the date of delivery of the Notice of Conversion, but in no event earlier than one (1) Trading Day after each Conversion Date. To the extent that the Conversion Shares are subject to an effective registration covering the issuance of such Conversion Shares to, or resale of such Conversion Shares by, the Holder, then such Conversion Shares shall be issued free and clear of any restrictive legends. (ii) If, in the case of any Notice of Conversion, such Conversion Shares are not delivered to or as directed by the applicable Holder by the Share Delivery Date, the Holder shall be entitled to elect by written notice to the Corporation at any time on or before its receipt of such Conversion Shares, to rescind such Conversion, in which event the Corporation shall promptly return to the Holder any original Preferred Stock certificate delivered to the Corporation and the Holder shall promptly return to the Corporation the Conversion Shares issued to such Holder pursuant to the rescinded Notice of Conversion. (iii) The Corporation s obligation to issue and deliver the Conversion Shares upon conversion of Preferred Stock in accordance with the terms hereof are absolute and unconditional, irrespective of any action or inaction by a Holder to enforce the same, any waiver or consent with respect to any provision hereof, the recovery of any judgment against any Person or any action to enforce the same, or any setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, limitation or termination, or any breach or alleged breach by such Holder or any other Person of any obligation to the Corporation or any violation or alleged violation of law by such Holder or any other person, and irrespective of any other circumstance which might otherwise limit such obligation of the Corporation to such Holder in connection with the issuance of such Conversion Shares; provided , however , that such delivery shall not operate as a waiver by the Corporation of any such action that the Corporation may have against such Holder. (iv) The Corporation covenants that it will at all times reserve and keep available out of its authorized and unissued shares of Common Stock for the sole purpose of issuance upon conversion of the Preferred Stock and payment of dividends on the Preferred Stock, each as provided herein, free from preemptive rights or any other actual contingent purchase rights of Persons other than the Holder (and the other holders of the Preferred Stock), not less than such aggregate number of shares of the Common Stock as shall (subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Purchase Agreement) be issuable (taking into account the adjustments and restrictions of Section 7) upon the conversion of the then outstanding shares of Preferred Stock and payment of dividends hereunder. 

 The Corporation covenants that all shares of Common Stock that shall be so issuable shall, upon issue, be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable. (v) No fractional shares or scrip representing fractional shares shall be issued upon the conversion of the Preferred Stock. As to any fraction of a share which the Holder would otherwise be entitled to purchase upon such conversion, the Corporation shall at its election, either pay a cash adjustment in respect of such final fraction in an amount equal to such fraction multiplied by the Conversion Rate or round up to the next whole share. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, but consistent with the provisions of this subsection with respect to fractional Conversion Shares, nothing shall prevent any Holder from converting fractional shares of Preferred Stock. (vi) The issuance of Conversion Shares on conversion of this Preferred Stock shall be made without charge to any Holder for any documentary stamp or similar taxes that may be payable in respect of the issue or delivery of such Conversion Shares, provided that the Corporation shall not be required to pay any tax that may be payable in respect of any transfer involved in the issuance and delivery of any such Conversion Shares upon conversion in a name other than that of the Holders of such shares of Preferred Stock and the Corporation shall not be required to issue or deliver such Conversion Shares unless or until the Person or Persons requesting the issuance thereof shall have paid to the Corporation the amount of such tax or shall have established to the satisfaction of the Corporation that such tax has been paid. The Corporation shall pay all Transfer Agent fees required for same-day processing of any Notice of Conversion and all fees to the Depository Trust Corporation (or another established clearing corporation performing similar functions) required for same-day electronic delivery of the Conversion Shares. (c) If, at any time while the Preferred Stock is outstanding, (i) the Corporation, directly or indirectly, in one or more related transactions is a party to any merger or consolidation of the Corporation, (ii) the Corporation, directly or indirectly, effects any sale, lease, license, assignment, transfer, conveyance or other disposition of all or substantially all of its assets in one or a series of related transactions, (iii) any, direct or indirect, purchase offer, tender offer or exchange offer (whether by the Corporation or another Person) is completed, (iv) the Corporation, directly or indirectly, in one or more related transactions effects any reclassification, reorganization or recapitalization of the Common Stock or any compulsory share exchange, in each case pursuant to which the Common Stock is converted into, exchanged for or represents solely the right to receive, other securities, cash or property, or any combination thereof (such other securities, cash or property, or combination thereof, the Reference Property , and the amount and kind of Reference Property that a holder of one share of Common Stock would be entitled to receive on account of such transaction, a Reference Property Unit (each such transaction, a Fundamental Transaction ), then, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, (I) at the effective time of such Fundamental Transaction, the Conversion Shares due upon conversion of any Preferred Stock shall be determined in the same manner as if each reference to any number of shares of Common Stock in this Certificate of Designation were instead a reference to the same number of Reference Property Units and (II) if such Reference Property Unit consists of any security of a Person other than the Corporation, then such Person (and, as a condition to the Corporation effecting such Fundamental Transaction, the Corporation shall ensure that such Person) shall execute such instruments as shall be necessary to give effect to this Section 7(c). If holders of Common Stock are given any choice as to the securities, cash or property to be received in such Fundamental Transaction, then each Holder shall be given the same choice as to the Reference Property Unit it receives upon any conversion of the Preferred Stock following such Fundamental Transaction. To the extent necessary to effectuate the foregoing provisions, any successor to the Corporation or surviving entity in such Fundamental Transaction shall file a new Certificate of Designation with the same terms and conditions and issue to the Holders new preferred stock consistent with the foregoing provisions and evidencing the Holders right to convert such preferred 

 stock into Reference Property Units. The Corporation shall cause any successor entity in a Fundamental Transaction in which the Corporation is not the survivor (the Successor Entity to assume in writing all of the obligations of the Corporation under this Certificate of Designation and the other Transaction Documents in accordance with the provisions of this Section 7(c) pursuant to written agreements in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Holders and approved by the Holders (without unreasonable delay) prior to such Fundamental Transaction and shall, at the option of the Holders, deliver to the Holder in exchange for the Preferred Stock a security of the Successor Entity evidenced by a written instrument substantially similar in form and substance to the Preferred Stock which is convertible in accordance with this Section 7(c), and which is reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to the Holders. Upon the occurrence of any such Fundamental Transaction, the Successor Entity shall succeed to, and, except in the case of a lease, be substituted for (so that from and after the date of such Fundamental Transaction, the provisions of this Certificate of Designation and the other Transaction Documents referring to the Corporation shall refer instead to the Successor Entity), and may exercise every right and power of the Corporation and shall assume all of the obligations of the Corporation under this Certificate of Designation and the other Transaction Documents with the same effect as if such Successor Entity had been named as the Corporation herein. Section 8. Adjustments; Rights of Holders Upon Certain Dividends, Distributions or Fundamental Transactions. (a) If the Corporation, at any time while any Preferred Stock is outstanding: (i) pays a stock dividend or otherwise makes a distribution or distributions payable in shares of Common Stock on shares of Common Stock, (ii) subdivides outstanding shares of Common Stock into a larger number of shares or (iii) combines (including by way of a reverse stock split) outstanding shares of Common Stock into a smaller number of shares, then the Conversion Rate shall be adjusted to equal an amount equal to such Conversion Rate immediately before such adjustment multiplied by a fraction of which the numerator shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately before giving effect to such event, and of which the denominator shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to such event as applicable. (b) In addition to any adjustments pursuant to Section 7(a) above, if at any time the Corporation grants, issues or sells any Common Stock Equivalents or rights to purchase stock, warrants, securities or other property pro rata to the record holders of any class of shares of Common Stock (the Purchase Rights ), then, without duplication of any dividends to be due on Preferred Stock pursuant to Section 3(a), each Holder will be entitled to acquire, upon the terms applicable to such Purchase Rights, the aggregate Purchase Rights which the Holder could have acquired if such Holder had held the number of shares of Common Stock acquirable upon conversion of such Holder s Preferred Stock (without regard to any limitations on exercise hereof) on the date on which a record is taken for the grant, issuance or sale of such Purchase Rights, or, if no such record is taken, the date as of which the record holders of shares of Common Stock are to be determined for the grant, issue or sale of such Purchase Rights. (c) All calculations under this Section 8 shall be made to the nearest cent or the nearest 1/100th of a share, as the case may be. For purposes of this Section 8, the number of shares of Common Stock deemed to be issued and outstanding as of a given date shall be the sum of the number of shares of Common Stock (excluding any treasury shares of the Corporation) issued and outstanding. (d) Notice to Holders. (i) Whenever the Conversion Rate is adjusted pursuant to any provision of this Section 8, the Corporation shall promptly deliver to each Holder a notice setting forth the Conversion Rate after such adjustment and setting forth a brief statement of the facts requiring such adjustment. 

 (ii) If (A) the Corporation shall declare a dividend (or any other distribution in whatever form) on the Common Stock, (B) the Corporation shall declare a special nonrecurring cash dividend on or a redemption of the Common Stock, (C) the Corporation shall authorize the granting to all holders of the Common Stock of rights or warrants to subscribe for or purchase any shares of capital stock of any class or of any rights, (D) the approval of any stockholders of the Corporation shall be required in connection with any reclassification of the Common Stock, any consolidation or merger to which the Corporation is a party, any sale or transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of the Corporation, or any compulsory share exchange whereby the Common Stock is converted into other securities, cash or property or (E) the Corporation shall authorize the voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the affairs of the Corporation, then, in each case, the Corporation shall cause to be filed at each office or agency maintained for the purpose of conversion of the Preferred Stock, and shall cause to be delivered to each Holder at its last address as it shall appear upon the stock books of the Corporation, at least twenty (20) calendar days prior to the applicable record or effective date hereinafter specified, a notice stating (x) the date on which a record is to be taken for the purpose of such dividend, distribution, redemption, rights or warrants, or if a record is not to be taken, the date as of which the holders of the Common Stock of record to be entitled to such dividend, distributions, redemption, rights or warrants are to be determined or (y) the date on which such reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale, transfer, share exchange, dissolution, liquidation or winding up is expected to become effective or close, and the date as of which it is expected that holders of the Common Stock of record shall be entitled to exchange their shares of the Common Stock for securities, cash or other property deliverable upon such reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale, transfer, share exchange, dissolution, liquidation or winding up, provided that the failure to deliver such notice or any defect therein or in the delivery thereof shall not affect the validity of the corporate action required to be specified in such notice. Section 9. Repurchased or Reacquired Shares . Shares of Preferred Stock that have been repurchased or reacquired by the Corporation shall be restored to the status of authorized, unissued and undesignated shares that shall be available for future issuance.
