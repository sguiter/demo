USE
OF MARKET AND INDUSTRY DATA 

This
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q includes market and industry data that we have obtained from third-party sources, including industry publications,
as well as industry data prepared by our management on the basis of its knowledge of and experience in the industries in which we operate
(including our management s estimates and assumptions relating to such industries based on that knowledge). Management has developed
its knowledge of such industries through its experience and participation in these industries. While our management believes the third-party
sources referred to in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are reliable, neither we nor our management have independently verified any
of the data from such sources referred to in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q or ascertained the underlying economic assumptions relied
upon by such sources. Furthermore, internally prepared and third-party market prospective information, in particular, are estimates only
and there will usually be differences between the prospective and actual results, because events and circumstances frequently do not
occur as expected, and those differences may be material. Also, references in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q to any publications,
reports, surveys or articles prepared by third parties should not be construed as depicting the complete findings of the entire publication,
report, survey or article. The information in any such publication, report, survey or article is not incorporated by reference in this
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 

Solely
for convenience, we refer to trademarks in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q without the or the or symbols, but such references
are not intended to indicate that we will not assert, to the fullest extent under applicable law, our rights to our own trademarks. Other
service marks, trademarks and trade names referred to in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, if any, are the property of their respective
owners, although for presentational convenience we may not use the or the symbols to identify such trademarks.

the context otherwise indicates, when used in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the terms Deep Green we, 
 us, our, the Company and similar terms refer to Deep Green Waste Recycling, Inc., a Wyoming
corporation formerly known as Critic Clothing, Inc., and affiliates. 

CAUTIONARY
NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 

This
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended September 30, 2024 (the Quarterly Report contains forward-looking statements
within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended (the Exchange Act ). These statements relate to future events (including, without limitation, the terms, timing
and closing of our proposed acquisitions or our future financial performance). We have attempted to identify forward-looking statements
by using terminology such as anticipates, believes, expects, can, continue, 
 could, estimates, expects, intends, may, plans, potential, 
 predict, should or will or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology. These
statements are only predictions; uncertainties and other factors may cause our actual results, levels of activity, performance or achievements
to be materially different from any future results, levels or activity, performance or achievements expressed or implied by these forward-looking
statements. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee
future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements. Our expectations are as of the date this Quarterly Report is filed,
and we do not intend to update any of the forward-looking statements after the date this Quarterly Report is filed to confirm these statements
to actual results, unless required by law. 

You
should not place undue reliance on forward looking statements. The cautionary statements set forth in this Quarterly Report identify
important factors which you should consider in evaluating our forward-looking statements. These factors include, among other things: 

Our
 ability to effectively execute our business plan; 

Our
 ability to manage our expansion, growth and operating expenses; 

Our
 ability to protect our brands and reputation; 

3 

Our
 ability to repay our debts; 

Our
 ability to evaluate and measure our business, prospects and performance metrics; 

Our
 ability to compete and succeed in a highly competitive and evolving industry; 

Our
 ability to respond and adapt to changes in technology and customer behavior; 

Risks
 in connection with completed or potential acquisitions, dispositions and other strategic growth opportunities and initiatives; 

Risks
 related to the anticipated timing of the closing of any potential acquisitions; 

Risks
 related to the integration with regards to potential or completed acquisitions; 

Various
 risks related to health epidemics, pandemics and similar outbreaks, such as the coronavirus disease 2019 COVID-19 pandemic, which may have material adverse effects on our business, financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows. 

This
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q also contains estimates and other statistical data made by independent parties and by us relating to market
size and growth and other industry data. This data involves a number of assumptions and limitations, and you are cautioned not to give
undue weight to such estimates. We have not independently verified the statistical and other industry data generated by independent parties
and contained in this Quarterly Report and, accordingly, we cannot guarantee their accuracy or completeness, though we do generally believe
the data to be reliable. In addition, projections, assumptions and estimates of our future performance and the future performance of
the industries in which we operate are necessarily subject to a high degree of uncertainty and risk due to a variety of factors. Our
actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements for many reasons, including, but not
limited to, the possibility that we may fail to preserve our expertise in consumer product development; that existing and potential distribution
partners may opt to work with, or favor the products of, competitors if our competitors offer more favorable products or pricing terms;
that we may be unable to maintain or grow sources of revenue; that we may be unable maintain profitability; that we may be unable to
attract and retain key personnel; or that we may not be able to effectively manage, or to increase, our relationships with customers;
that we may have unexpected increases in costs and expenses. These and other factors could cause results to differ materially from those
expressed in the estimates made by the independent parties and by us.

B - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued) 

The
result of this accounting treatment could be that the fair value of a financial instrument is classified as a derivative instrument and
is marked-to-market at each balance sheet date and recorded as a liability. In the event that the fair value is recorded as a liability,
the change in fair value is recorded in the statement of operations as other income or other expense. Upon conversion or exercise of
a derivative instrument, the instrument is marked to fair value at the conversion date and then that fair value is reclassified to equity.
Financial instruments that are initially classified as equity that become subject to reclassification under ASC Topic 815-40 are reclassified
to a liability account at the fair value of the instrument on the reclassification date.

B - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued) 

On
July 13, 2017, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update ASU 2017-11. Among
other things, ASU 2017-11 provides guidance that eliminates the requirement to consider down round features when determining
whether certain financial instruments or embedded features are indexed to an entity s stock and need to be classified as liabilities.
ASU 2017-11 provides for entities to recognize the effect of a down round feature only when it is triggered and then as a dividend and
a reduction to income available to common stockholders in basic earnings per share. The guidance was effective for annual periods beginning
after December 15, 2018; early adoption was permitted. 

The
Company early adopted ASU 2017-11. As a result, we have not recognized the fair value of the warrants containing down round features
as liabilities. Please see NOTE K - CAPITAL STOCK for further information.

 (Unaudited) 

,
current assets of , current liabilities of and an accumulated deficit of . For the nine months ended September
30, 2024 and 2023, we had net losses of and respectively. We expect to continue to incur negative cash flows until
such time as our operating segments generate sufficient cash inflows to finance our operations and debt service requirements. 

In
performing the second step of this assessment, we are required to evaluate whether our plans to mitigate the conditions above alleviate
the substantial doubt about our ability to meet our obligations as they become due within one year after the date that the financial
statements are issued. Our future plans include securing additional funding sources that may include establishing corporate partnerships,
establishing licensing revenue agreements, issuing additional convertible debentures and issuing public or private equity securities,
including selling common stock through an at-the-market facility (ATM). 

There
is no assurance that sufficient funds required during the next year or thereafter will be generated from operations or that funds will
be available through external sources. The lack of additional capital resulting from the inability to generate cash flow from operations
or to raise capital from external sources would force the Company to substantially curtail or cease operations and would, therefore,
have a material effect on the business. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that any such required funds, if available, will be available
on attractive terms or they will not have a significant dilutive effect on the Company s existing shareholders. We have therefore
concluded there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern through November 2025. 

The
accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going-concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets
and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include
any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification
of liabilities that may result from our failure to continue as a going concern.

ITEM
2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 

Overview 

Deep
Green Waste Recycling, Inc. (f/k/a Critic Clothing, Inc.) Deep Green , the Company , we ,
 us , or our is a publicly quoted company seeking to create value for its shareholders by seeking to acquire
other operating entities for growth in return for shares of our common stock.

On
August 24, 2017, the Company acquired all the membership units of Deep Green Waste and Recycling, LLC DGWR LLC ), a Georgia

September 27, 2017 reverse stock split of 1 share for 1000 shares) of the Company s common stock. The transaction was accounted
for as a reverse merger where DGWR LLC was considered the accounting acquiror and the Company was considered the accounting
acquiree. 

Effective
October 1, 2017, Deep Green acquired Compaction and Recycling Equipment, Inc. (CARE), a Portland, Oregon based company that sells and
services waste and recycling equipment. Deep Green purchased 100 of the common stock for 902,700. 586,890 was paid in cash at closing

On

(the Agreement with Mirabile Corporate Holdings, Inc. Under the terms of the Agreement, the Company transferred all capital
stock of its two wholly owned subsidiaries, Compaction and Recycling Equipment, Inc. and Columbia Financial Services, Inc., to Mirabile

Officer owned a 7.5 equity interest in Mirabile Corporate Holdings, Inc. 

On
August 7, 2018, the Company ceased its waste recycling business. 

The
Company re-launched its waste and recycling services operation and has begun to re-engage with customers, waste haulers and recycling
centers, which are critical elements of its historically successful business model: designing and managing waste programs for commercial
and institutional properties for cost savings, ease of operation, and minimal administrative stress for its clients. 

31 

Asset
Purchase Agreement 

On
February 8, 2021, the Company, through its wholly owned subsidiary DG Research, Inc. (the Buyer ), entered into an Asset
Purchase Agreement (the Agreement with Amwaste, Inc. (the Seller ). Under the terms of the Agreement, the
Buyer agreed to purchase from the Seller certain assets (the Assets utilized in the Seller s waste management business
located in Glynn County, Georgia. In consideration for the purchase of the Assets, the Buyer paid the seller 160,000 and issued the
Seller 2,000,000 shares of the Company s restricted common stock. The Buyer remitted 50,000 at Closing and issued the Seller a
Promissory Note (the Note in the amount of 110,000, which was paid April 9, 2021. The Note was secured by the Assets
purchased through the Agreement. The transaction closed on February 11, 2021. 

In
order to further grow its business, the Company plans to: 

expand
 its service offerings to provide additional sustainable waste management solutions that further minimize costs based on volume and
 content of waste streams, and methods of disposal, including landfills, transfer stations and recycling centers; 

Acquire
 profitable waste and recycling services companies with similar or compatible and synergistic business models, that can help the Company
 achieve these objectives; 

Offer
 innovative recycling services that significantly reduce the disposal of plastics, electronic wastes, food wastes, and hazardous wastes
 in the commercial property universe; 

Establish
 partnerships with innovative universities, municipalities and companies; and 

Attract
 investment funds who will actively work with the Company to achieve these goals and help the Company grow into a leading waste and
 recycling services supplier in North America. 

Some
potential merger/acquisition candidates have been identified and discussions initiated. These candidates are within the Company s
core business model, serving commercial properties, accretive to cash flow, and geographically favorable. While seeking to identify acquisition
candidates, the Company seeks to identify target entities with a similar core business model or a model which naturally integrates with
its own, and which are situated in opportunistic geographic locations. 

We
have unrestricted discretion in seeking and participating in a business opportunity, subject to the availability of such opportunities,
economic conditions, and other factors. 

The
selection of a business opportunity in which to participate is complex and risky. Additionally, we have only limited resources and may
find it difficult to locate good opportunities. There can be no assurance that we will be able to identify and acquire any business opportunity
which will ultimately prove to be beneficial to us and our shareholders. We will select any potential business opportunity based on our
management s best business judgment. 

Our
activities are subject to several significant risks, which arise primarily as a result of the fact that we have no specific business
and may acquire or participate in a business opportunity based on the decision of management, which potentially could act without the
consent, vote, or approval of our shareholders. The risks faced by us are further increased as a result of its lack of resources and
our inability to provide a prospective business opportunity with significant capital. 

Critical
Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates 

Our
management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial
statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or
GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial
statements as well as the reported expenses during the reporting periods. The accounting estimates that require our most significant,
difficult and subjective judgments have an impact on revenue recognition, the determination of share-based compensation and financial
instruments. We evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates under
different assumptions or conditions. 

Our
significant accounting policies are more fully described in NOTE B - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES to our consolidated
financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

Revenues 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we generated 837,037 and 1,214,677 revenue, respectively. In 3 rd quarter
2023, we began work on the Oxford House Project at Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC). As a result, our 3 rd quarter
2023 asbestos-related revenues were substantially greater than 3Q 2024. YTD 2024 revenues for other channels, such as Mold, Lead and
Radon channels were all up, 40 , 135 and 45 respectively. 

Cost
of Sales 

Our
cost of sales was 201,416 and 229,730 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. This highlights our low
cost of performing remediation work. 

Gross
Profit 

YTD
gross profit dropped to 635,621 from 984,947 the prior year. So even though our other revenue channels outperformed year-over-year,
we were not able to compensate for the considerable 2023 VUMC project. 

Operating
expenses 

Our
operating expenses of 1,172,716 are down from 1,747,196 year-over-year which was driven almost exclusively by 2023 non-cash stock compensation.
This was offset by intentional increases in facilities cost and a catch up for employee incentive accrual of 95K 

Operating
Loss 

Our
operating loss was 537,095) and 762,249) for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 

We
anticipate that our cost of revenues will increase in 2024 and for the foreseeable future as we continue to build out our remediation
services and identify acquisition opportunities in the waste and recycling sector. 

Other
Income (Expense) 

Other
Income improved to (135,238) for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. This was driven largely by 500K noncash derivative calculation
adjustment and 81K of a trade payable gain. 

Net
Income 

The
Company s loss was (422,459) for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to a loss of 1,499,679) for the same period
in 2023. This represents a 1.1M year-over-year improvement.

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

At
September 30, 2024, we had current assets of 208,239 and current liabilities of 4,374,702 resulting in negative working capital of
 4,166,463, of which 2,867,135 was accounts payable and 168.198 was included in accrued interest. At September 30, 2024, we had total
assets of 1,036,3980 and total liabilities of 4,535,668 resulting in stockholders deficit of (3,499,270). 

At
December 31, 2023, we had current assets of 1,193,986 and current liabilities of 5,421,592 resulting in negative working capital of
 4,227,606, of which 3,028,905 was accounts payable and 102,286 was included in deferred compensation. At December 31, 2023, we had
total assets of 2,121,542 and total liabilities of 5,421,592 resulting in stockholders deficit of (3,300,050). 

Accounts
Payable 

At
September 30, 2024, the Company had accounts payable of 2,867,135 that consisted of 487,615 in default judgments due to prior vendors,
 2,181,877 due to vendors for materials and services and 214,332 due for credit card obligations. 

At
December 31, 2023, the Company had accounts payable of 3,028,905 that consisted of 487,615 in default judgments due to prior vendors,
 2,325,693 due to vendors for materials and services and 215,597 due for credit card obligations. 

Debt 

At
September 30, 2024, the Company had outstanding secured notes and convertible notes payable of 484,288 and other debt of 438,714. Please
see NOTE H DEBT and NOTE I - SECURED NOTES AND CONVERTIBLE NOTES PAYABLE for further information. 

At
December 31, 2023, the Company had outstanding secured notes and convertible notes payable of 971,788 and other debt of 575,077. Please
 see NOTE H DEBT and NOTE I- SECURED NOTES AND CONVERTIBLE NOTES PAYABLE for further information. 

Cash
on Hand 

Our
cash on hand as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was 58,488 and 318,441, respectively. 

Satisfaction
of Outstanding Liabilities 

As
of September 30, 2024, the Company has a liability of 487,615 as a result of three (3) default judgments. The Company intends to negotiate
settlements and establish payment plans with each creditor that will satisfy these judgements. Nonetheless, some or all of the creditors
may elect to bring further litigation to protect their claims or perfect their judgments. 

The
Company accrued customer deposits in the form of advance payments for waste management services that could not be delivered when the
Company suspended operations in August 2018. The Company intends to either resume waste management services with those customers or refund
the advance payments through a repayment plan. 

There
can be no assurance that sufficient funds required during the next year or thereafter will be generated from operations or that funds
will be available from external sources such as debt or equity financings or other potential sources to satisfy these outstanding liabilities.
The lack of additional capital resulting from the inability to generate cash flow from operations or to raise capital from external sources
would force the Company to substantially curtail or cease operations and would, therefore, have a material adverse effect on its business. 

34 

We
currently have no external sources of liquidity such as arrangements with credit institutions or off-balance sheet arrangements that
will have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition or immediate access to capital. 

We
are dependent on the sale of our securities to fund our operations and will remain so until we generate sufficient revenues to pay for
our operating costs. Our officers and directors have made no written commitments with respect to providing a source of liquidity in the
form of cash advances, loans and/or financial guarantees. 

If
we are unable to raise the funds, we will seek alternative financing through means such as borrowings from institutions or private individuals.
There can be no assurance that we will be able to raise the capital we need for our operations from the sale of our securities. We have
not located any sources for these funds and may not be able to do so in the future. We expect that we will seek additional financing
in the future. However, we may not be able to obtain additional capital or generate sufficient revenues to fund our operations. If we
are unsuccessful at raising sufficient funds, for whatever reason, to fund our operations, we may be forced to cease operations. If we
fail to raise funds, we expect that we will be required to seek protection from creditors under applicable bankruptcy laws. 

Our
independent registered public accounting firm has expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern and believes
that our ability is dependent on our ability to implement our business plan, raise capital and generate revenues. Please see NOTE
N - GOING CONCERN UNCERTAINTY for further information.

Debt was 438,714 and 575,077 at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Included within the Debt was the following

Convertible
Notes 

On
October 14, 2021, the Company (the Borrower entered into a Note Purchase Agreement NPA with each of BHP
Capital NY Inc. and Quick Capital, LLC (together, the Investors and issued each of the Investors a Secured Convertible
Promissory Note (the Note in the amount of Six Hundred Sixty-Six Thousand Six Hundred Sixty-Seven and NO/100 Dollars 666,667).
The Note is convertible, in whole or in part, at any time and from time to time before maturity (October 14, 2022) at the option of the
holder at the Fixed Conversion Price that shall be the lesser of: (a) 0.01 or (b) 70 multiplied by the Market Price (as defined herein)
(representing a discount rate of 30 (the Fixed Conversion Price ). Market Price means the average of the
two lowest Closing Prices (as defined below) for the Common Stock during the twenty (20) Trading Day period ending on the latest complete
Trading Day prior to the Conversion Date Trading Day shall mean any day on which the Common Stock is tradable for any period
on the OTCBB, OTCQB or on the principal securities exchange or other securities market on which the Common Stock is then being quoted
or traded. To the extent the Conversion Price of the Borrower s Common Stock closes below the par value per share, the Borrower
will take all steps necessary to solicit the consent of the stockholders to reduce the par value of the Common Stock to the lowest value
possible under law. The Borrower agrees to honor all conversions submitted pending this adjustment. If the shares of the Borrower s
Common Stock have not been delivered within three (3) business days to the Holder, the Notice of Conversion may be rescinded by the Holder.
If the Trading Price cannot be calculated for such security on such date in the manner provided above, the Trading Price shall be the
fair market value as mutually determined by the Borrower and the Holder for which the calculation of the Trading Price is required in
order to determine the Conversion Price of such Notes. If at any time the Conversion Price as determined hereunder for any conversion
would be less than the par value of the Common Stock, then at the sole discretion of the Holder, the Conversion Price hereunder may equal
such par value for such conversion and the Conversion Amount for such conversion may be increased to include Additional Principal, where
 Additional Principal means such additional amount to be added to the Conversion Amount to the extent necessary to cause
the number of conversion shares issuable upon such conversion to equal the same number of conversion shares as would have been issued
had the Conversion Price not been adjusted by the Holder to the par value price. The Note has a term of one (1) year and bears interest
at 10 annually. As part and parcel of the foregoing transaction, each of the Investors was issued 1,533 shares of common stock as Commitment
shares and a warrant (the Warrant granting the holder the right to purchase up to 44,444 shares of the Company s
common stock at an exercise price of 22.50 for a term of 5-years. The transaction closed on October 19, 2021 As of June 30, 2024, 39,388
principal was due on the Quick Capital Note and 69,900 principal was due on the BHP Capital Note.

Cash
Flows 

We
had net cash provided by (used in) operating activities for the six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 of 261,745 and (120,236),
respectively. 

We
had net cash provided in investing activities for the six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 of 173,610 and 51,585, respectively.
First quarter 2024 proceeds were from the sale of Amwaste rolloff operations. 

We
had net cash provided (used) by financing activities for the six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 of (684,358) and 62,330,
respectively. First quarter use of funds were used to pay back the 2023 funding that was needed for our large remediation project at
Vanderbilt University Medical Center. 

Required
Capital Over the Next Twelve Months 

We
expect to incur losses from operations for the near future. We believe we will have to raise an additional 500,000 to expand our operations
over the next twelve months, including roughly 50,000 to remain current in our filings with the SEC. The additional funds will be utilized
for hiring ancillary staff and key personnel, corporate website and SEO development, acquisition(s) in the waste and recycling management
sector and day-to-day operations. 

Future
financing may include the issuance of equity or debt securities, obtaining credit facilities, or other financing mechanisms. Even if
we are able to raise the funds required, it is possible that we could incur unexpected costs and expenses or experience unexpected cash
requirements that would force us to seek alternative financing. Furthermore, if we issue additional equity or debt securities, existing
holders of our securities may experience additional dilution or the new equity securities may have rights, preferences or privileges
senior to those of existing holders of our securities. 

If
additional financing is not available or is not available on acceptable terms, we may be required to delay or alter our business plan
based on available financing.

C ritical
Accounting Policies and Estimates 

The
SEC issued Financial Reporting Release No. 60, Cautionary Advice Regarding Disclosure About Critical Accounting Policies 
suggesting that companies provide additional disclosure and commentary on their most critical accounting policies. In Financial Reporting
Release No. 60, the SEC has defined the most critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of a company s
financial condition and operating results and require management to make its most difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result
of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. Based on this definition, we have identified the following significant
policies as critical to the understanding of our financial statements. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make a variety of estimates and assumptions that affect (i) the reported amounts
of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and (ii) the
reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods covered by the financial statements. Our management expects to
make judgments and estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. As the number of variables and assumptions affecting
the future resolution of the uncertainties increase, these judgments become even more subjective and complex. Although we believe that
our estimates and assumptions are reasonable, actual results may differ significantly from these estimates. Changes in estimates and
assumptions based upon actual results may have a material impact on our results. 

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements 

We
did not have, during the periods presented, and we do not currently have, any relationships with any organizations or financial partnerships,
such as structured finance or special purpose entities, that would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance
sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes.

Disclosure
Controls and Procedures 

The
Company has adopted and maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information
required to be disclosed in the reports filed under the Exchange Act, such as this Form 10-Q, is collected, recorded, processed, summarized
and reported within the time periods specified in the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Company s disclosure
controls and procedures are also designed to ensure that such information is accumulated and communicated to management to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure. As required under Exchange Act Rule 13a-15, the Company s management, including the Principal
Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, has conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of disclosure controls and procedures
as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon that evaluation, the Company s President concluded that the Company s
disclosure controls and procedures are not effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports
that the Company files or submits under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified
in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including
the Company s President, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

During
the quarter ended June 30, 2024, there was no change in internal control over financial reporting that has materially affected or is
reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.

ITEM
1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 

On
December 31, 2022, management became aware of a Summons of Notice filed by Owen May and MD Global Partners with the State of New York
which names Lloyd T. Spencer and Deep Green Waste Recycling. The summons claims breach of contract and other unsubstantiated accusations
seeking 350,000 in compensatory damages and 3,500,000 in punitive damages. Deep Green retained legal counsel in Manhattan, NY to refute
the claims. On 5/29/2024, a Stipulation to Discontinue with Prejudice was filed with the Supreme Court of the State of New York, and
accepted on May 30, 2024. 

Other
than the aforementioned case which has now been dismissed, we are not a party to any material pending legal proceedings, nor are we aware
of any pending litigation or legal proceeding against us that would have a material adverse effect upon our results of operations or
financial condition.
