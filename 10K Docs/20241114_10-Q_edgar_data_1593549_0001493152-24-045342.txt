Notes
to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements 

during the said period. On September 11, 2014, we filed a Current Report on Form 8-K indicating
that we were no longer a shell company as defined by Rule12b-2 of the Exchange Act in light of our operations through the quarter that
ended June 30, 2014. 

On
December 26, 2014, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger Nugene Merger Agreement with NuGene Inc., a California
corporation NuGene ). On December 29, 2014 (the Closing Date ), we filed a certificate of merger in the State
of California whereby our subsidiary, NG Acquisition Inc. Acquisition Sub ), merged with NuGene. As a result, NuGene, the
surviving entity, became our wholly owned subsidiary. The transaction under the Nugene Merger Agreement was deemed to be a reverse merger,
whereby the Company (the legal acquirer) is considered the accounting acquiree and NuGene is considered the accounting acquirer, and
NuGene (the legal acquiree) is considered the accounting acquirer. The assets, liabilities, and operations of the acquired entity, NuGene,
were brought forward at their book value, and no goodwill was recognized. 

In
connection with the NuGene Merger Agreement, we entered into a Business Transfer and Indemnity Agreement dated December 29, 2014 (the
 Indemnity Agreement with our former Chief Executive Officer and Director, Dena Kurland providing for: 

The
 transfer of our jewelry business operations existing on the date of the Indemnity Agreement (the BMI Business 

The
 assumption by Ms. Kurland of all liabilities of our Company and the indemnification by Ms. Kurland holding our Company harmless for
 any and all liabilities arising at or before the date of the Indemnity Agreement; 

The
 payment by NuGene to Ms. Kurland of in cash; and 

The
 surrender by Ms. Kurland of shares (before giving effect to the Stock Split discussed below) (the Indemnity Shares of our Company s common stock representing of the then outstanding common stock (all of which shares have been deemed cancelled
 by the Company). 

Pursuant
to the terms of the Nugene Merger Agreement, shares of Company common stock and Company a newly designated Series
A Preferred Stock were issued to the former NuGene shareholders. The Series A Preferred Stock was: (i) , (ii) shares of Series A Preferred Stock outstanding, the holders
of the Series A Preferred Stock had the right to elect a majority of the board of directors and (iii) . 

On
December 26, 2014, . 

On
December 29, 2014, we completed the sale of shares of our common stock to 18 purchasers Stock Placement for
proceeds totaling , including (a) of cash and (b) automatic conversion of promissory notes in the principal amount
of . 

NuGene
was incorporated in California in December 2006 and formed and funded by our founders, Ali Kharazmi and Mohammed Kharazmi, M.D. The initial
focus of NuGene was to develop and market customized skin care products. As part of that focus, NuGene sought to leverage the working
relationships developed by our founders with the plastic surgery community. NuGene directed significant time and resources on developing
anti-aging and scar treatment/reduction products. 

In
2007 Nugene continued to focus on age-defying products utilizing peptide complexes (see further description below) and
nano-encapsulation for absorption into the skin (see additional description below). We introduced a limited product line under the NuGene
name and co-branded the products with an affiliated entity, Genetic Institute of Anti-Aging, Inc. GIAA ), which the Kharazmi
owned. We utilized the services of a Korean-based contract manufacturer to supply our products. This product line (the GIAA Line was based on peptides and did not utilize stem cells. We had very modest sales in 2007, with our sole customer GIAA, a related party. 

In
2008 we stopped production of the GIAA Line, and sales were limited to selling the remaining inventory through medical offices and GIAA.
With the GIAA Line discontinued, we spent the remainder of 2008 considering different formulations and methodologies for improved anti-aging
products. 

In
2009 and 2010, we had limited activity and minimal sales. Our sales were mainly overseas and limited to the remaining inventory of the
GIAA Line. We continued to explore how we might advance our formulations and methodologies. We expended funds on research and development,
carried out mainly by scientists engaged by the Company. 

In
2011 our founders decided to use adult adipose human stem cells (undifferentiated cells found throughout the body that multiply by cell
division to replenish dying cells and regenerate tissues) as the foundation of the formulation for its products. In 2011 the Company
developed a proprietary process to extract human adult stem cells from fat cells that the Company then used in its customized NuGene
line explicitly made for those client(s). Throughout 2011 we continued to provide autologous, or mature, fat-derived stem cells for use
in clinical procedures utilizing this technology. Through this process, the Company refined its ability to culture adult human stem cells
to render human-conditioned stem cell media at a proprietary concentration, a primary ingredient in the NuGene line of cosmeceuticals.
The Company believes that this proprietary concentration, combined with our unique formulations, will provide NuGene with a significant
competitive advantage. 

In
2012 we completed our initial line of cosmeceutical products based on these adipose-derived stem cells. We branded this advanced skincare
line solely under the NuGene name (the NuGene Line ). We eliminated the unpleasant odor associated with stem cells by adding
a fragrance with a very low incidence of allergic reaction. The packaging of this new product line bears no resemblance to the prior
GIAA Line. We also manufactured the NuGene Line ourselves at a small laboratory facility that we leased from an affiliated entity owned
by one of our founders. 

Throughout
2013 we continued to expand the product offerings of the NuGene Line. The Company focused its stem cell work on surgical and orthopedic
regeneration. These services were delivered to one client, which was an affiliated entity. Sales of the NuGene Line were limited as we
were in an initial rollout and branding phase. 

During
2014, we focused our efforts on transitioning to a cosmeceutical skincare business for mass distribution. With this transition and expanded
attention to our consumer products, we sought to develop our marketing plan and distribution channels. By the end of 2014, we had wholesalers
distributing products from the NuGene Line to medical offices and medical spas throughout the United States. December 31, 2014, we had
about 50 locations selling our products. In addition to the NuGene Line, we generated revenues from an affiliate, Advanced Surgical Partners ASP ), which is also owned by our CEO and Chairman of the Board, Messrs. Ali and Mohammed Kharazmi, respectively. Revenues
generated from ASP resulted from NuGene providing Plasma Rich Platelet and Stem Cell injections for orthopedic and plastic surgery procedures
to ASP. We provided these products and services to ASP as we transitioned into commercializing our cosmeceutical product lines. We expect
further to minimize these product sales and services to ASP in early 2015. 

Our
target customers primarily consisted of middle-aged men and women concerned with their aging skin and hair loss. Although our distributors
were primarily west of the Mississippi River, our products were sold throughout the United States. 

By
2017, our cosmeceutical skincare business had been discontinued as we could not obtain financing for operations on reasonable terms and
became inactive. Our corporate charter was revoked in Nevada 

On
January 26, 2020, Emergent, LLC Emergent ), a Nevada LLC controlled by Milan I Hoffman, was appointed the custodian of
the Company and proceeded to revive the Company s existence and resolve its outstanding indebtedness. This was completed as to
all indebtedness except for one convertible rate promissory note of . See Litigation. In March 2022, Ms. Hoffman sold her Series
A Preferred stock in the Company and certain shares of Series C Preferred Stock to Livento Group, LLC. Also in March 2022, David Stybr,
our CEO and the sole owner of Livento Group, LLC, agreed to contribute Livento Group, LLC to the Company in exchange for a transfer to
him of the Series A Preferred Stock which gave Mr. Stybr voting control of the Company. The Series C Preferred Stock purchased by Livento
Group, LLC was cancelled. As a result of these transactions our current operations are the operations of Livento Group, LLC 

Livento
Group operations started in 2017 as the internal team spearheaded the development of financial management software based on artificial
intelligence for investment entities. This software currently provides several clients with data processing and analytical services in
the investment management sector. Management believes that this segment of our operations will provide meaningful revenue, but we can
give no assurance that this will happen. The product is best described as an automated system that can analyze large quantities of data,
focusing on selected parameters and predicting short-term future behavior within a specific portfolio of selected assets. The software
chooses assets with the highest potential based on a set of specifications and properties, predicting short-term future behavior within
a particular portfolio.

Beneficial
conversion feature The issuance of the convertible debt generated a beneficial conversion feature BCF ), which
arises when a debt or equity security is issued with an embedded conversion option that is beneficial to the investor or in the money
at inception because the conversion option has an effective strike price that is less than the market price of the underlying stock at
the commitment date. The Company recognized the BCF by allocating the intrinsic value of the conversion option, which is the number of
shares of common stock available upon conversion multiplied by the difference between the effective conversion price per share and the
fair value of common stock per share on the commitment date, resulting in a discount on the convertible debt (recorded as a component
of additional paid-in capital). 

as of September 30, 2024 were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share
on the condensed consolidated statements of operations because the Company reported a net loss during the three months ended September
30, 2024, and December 31, 2023 and therefore the effect would be anti-dilutive. 

On
June 20, 2018, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2018-07, Compensation Stock
Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Nonemployee Share-Based Payment Accounting . ASU 2018-07 is intended to reduce cost and
complexity and to improve financial reporting for share-based payments to nonemployees (for example, service providers, external legal
counsel, suppliers, etc.). Under the new standard, companies will no longer be required to value non-employee awards differently from
employee awards. Meaning that companies will value all equity classified awards at their grant-date under ASC718 and forgo revaluing
the award after this date. The guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018. 

In
January 2017, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued an Accounting Standards Update ASU 2017-01, Business Combinations (Topic 805) Clarifying the Definition of a Business . The amendments in this update clarify the
definition of a business with the objective of adding guidance to assist entities with evaluating whether transactions should be accounted
for as acquisitions or disposals of assets or businesses. The definition of a business affects many areas of accounting including acquisitions,
disposals, goodwill, and consolidation. The guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017 and
should be applied prospectively on or after the effective date. The Company is in the process of evaluating the impact of this accounting
standard update. 

In
February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) . ASU 2016-02 requires lessees to recognize lease assets and lease
liabilities on the balance sheet and requires expanded disclosures about leasing arrangements. ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years
beginning after December 31, 2018 and interim periods in fiscal years beginning after December 31, 2018, with early adoption permitted.
The Company is in the process of evaluating the impact of this accounting standard update. 

The
Company has implemented all new accounting pronouncements that are in effect. These pronouncements did not have any material impact on
the financial statements unless otherwise disclosed, and the Company does not believe that there are any other new accounting pronouncements
that have been issued that might have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations. 

Other
accounting standards that have been issued or proposed by FASB that do not require adoption until a future date are not expected to have
a material impact on the consolidated financial statements upon adoption. The Company does not discuss recent pronouncements that are
not anticipated to have an impact on or are unrelated to its financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or disclosures.

RESULTS
OF OPERATIONS 

Comparison
of three months ended September 2024 and 2023 

The
following analysis of the results of operations for the three months ended September, 2024 and 2023 should be read in conjunction with
our condensed consolidated financial statements and the notes to those financial statements that are included elsewhere in this Quarterly
Report on Form 10-Q. Our discussion includes forward-looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties,
such as our plans, objectives, expectations, and intentions. Actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those
anticipated in these forward-looking statements because of a number of factors. An investment in our common stock involves a high degree
of risk. Readers of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q should carefully consider the risks set forth in the Risk Factors and Business
sections of our 10-12G/A. We use words such as anticipate, estimate, plan, project, 
 continuing, ongoing, expect, believe, intend, or similar expressions,
variations of those terms or the negative of those terms to identify forward- looking statements. The forward-looking statements specified
in the following information have been compiled by our management on the basis of assumptions made by management and considered by management
to be reasonable. Our future operating results, however, are impossible to predict and no representation, guaranty, or warranty is to
be inferred from those forward-looking statements.

Revenues 

Revenues
generated during the three months ended September 30, 2024 totaled 577,588. These came from sales of Elisee and our management services
for Global Dot Logistics and movie projects. We see similar result as three months ended September 30, 2023 with 586,120 which is due
to the fact that company focuses on movie development and the income is booked in Other income. 

Most
of the revenue for the quarter that ended September 30, 2024, was derived from software fees in the USA and Europe markets, Global Dot
Logistics management services and as well movie projects under BOXO Productions. Movie revenues belong to acquired movies during 2024
where initial two movies out of our 45 projects successfully entered distribution. Movie income is shown in Other income as a part of
profits BOXO will receive from finished movie package. Elisee is constantly serving to clients in Europe and USA and we see stable source
of income. 

Cost
of Revenues 

Our
costs of goods sold consist of Amortization of Intangible Assets in amount of 526,176, Professional fees of key professionals and consulting
fee that is related to generation of income from the Elisee in amount of 241,566. Our services sell for margins comparable with others
in industries similar to ours. Our margins will reflect our efficiency in our services, the desirability of our services and our ability
to grow revenue in order to scale our operations. Our relationships with our suppliers will also be important in procuring materials
at better pricing.

Advertising
and promotion 

Advertising
and promotion totaled approximately 37,385 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to approximately 283,907 for the
three months ended September 30, 2023. The use was mainly for online promotion and new marketing campaigns that we started during these
months focused on our products and company. 

Selling,
general and administrative 

Selling,
general and administrative expenses SGA totaled approximately 3,820 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared
to approximately 7,341 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease is linked to company s saving processes. 

Professional
fees 

Professional
fees totaled approximately 733 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to approximately 26,591 for the three months
ended September 30, 2023. The amount is mainly used to cover our services on other projects and internal Livento structure. The decrease
is caused by re-allocation of Livento services to specific cost centers. 

Comparison
of nine months ended September 2024 and 2023 

Revenues 

Revenues
generated during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 totaled 1,392,916. These came from sales of Elisee, Global Dot Logistics
management services and movie projects under BOXO Productions, Inc. We see approximately 100,000 difference compared to nine months ended
September 30, 2023 with 1,509,294. Important is to mention that company is booking income from movies into Other income. It totaled
 1,490,203 as of 30 th of September 2024.

CAPITAL
RESOURCES 

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements 

There
are no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition,
changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that
are material to investors. 

Inflation 

Inflation
and changing prices have had no material effect on our net sales and revenues or on our income from continuing operations over our two
most recent fiscal years. 

Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates 

Our
management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements,
which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements
requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and expenses and the disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities in our financial statements. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including
those related to the fair market value of our assets and accrued stock-based compensation expense. We base our estimates on historical
experience, known trends and events and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results
of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other
sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. In making estimates and judgments,
management employs critical accounting policies. 

Item
3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 

Not
applicable. 

Item
4. Controls and Procedures. 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Management
have established disclosure controls and procedures to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports
that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in SEC rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and made known to the officers who certify the Company s
financial reports and to other members of senior management and the Board of Directors as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure. Changes in internal control over financial reporting. 

Based
on their evaluation as of September 30, 2024, the principal executive officer and principal financial officer of the Company have concluded
that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934) are effective. 

Changes
in Internal Controls There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the second quarter of
fiscal 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART
II OTHER INFORMATION 

Item
1. Legal Proceedings. 

As
disclosed in Note 8 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company is not engaged in any legal matters, and to confirm
with the disclosure set forth in Note 8, the company currently doesn t have any active legal proceedings. 

Item
1A. Risk Factors. 

An
investment in the Company is highly speculative and involves a high degree of risk. 

Risks
Related to our Business 

We
have limited resources, and We may not be able to raise additional capital as it is needed to fund our operations and planned increased
investment levels. 

We
operated at a net loss of 1,081,767 for the period ended September 30, 2024, in addition to our cash resources, which were about 2,641
on September 30, 2024, which are inadequate to execute our growth plans, but should allow us to operate at current levels. The loss is
impacted by Amortization and Stock Based Compensations. We are dependent upon the additional investment of which there can be no assurance
and the proceeds of the rent of Elisse, Novelti software and movie projects. 

Cybersecurity 

Our
movie projects and Elisee software are stored online and thus are subject to potential thread of cybersecurity. We maintain data in clouds
that are highly protected, and we use firewall and antivirus tools to keep data safe. 

Financial
liabilities 

Our
results are affected by the timing and occurrence of payments from our clients and in case they have financial difficulties we can face
cash flow problems to pay our liabilities. Our management seeks to minimize this risk through close monitoring and relationship with
our clients. 

BOXO s
Movie Production Requires Substantial Capital and Continued Participation from Many Parties. 

BOXO s
production projects are capital intensive, frequently costing over 30 Million. Most of the required funds are provided by investors
who invest in entities formed for a particular project. Until and unless investor funds are received, it is challenging to retain directors,
actors, and others required for movie production. Management believes that the success or failure of each project can impact BOXO s
ability to raise funds for the next project timely. Suppose we were to have several consecutive projects on which investors did not realize
hoped-for returns. In that case, raising funds for future projects that provide a reasonable return for the Company or on any terms might
become significantly more challenging. Delays in raising capital may substantially and negatively affect BOXO s results. 

BOXO
relies on personal relationships rather than written agreements. 

The
BOXO team has worked on many projects together over decades and we rely on these personal relationships rather than formal agreements
to keep our team together. Accordingly, one or more of our key consultants may leave us at any time and this could adversely affect our
ability to produce new movies. 

The
Software Development Market is Highly Competitive and Fragmented. The business software development market is highly competitive and
includes many large and small competitors. While we have developed what we believe to be a unique platform that will prove commercially
viable, however, there is no assurance that this will prove to be the case or that in the future, software developers working for our
competitors will not expand upon or enhance our best features putting us at a competitive disadvantage. 

Minority
stockholders will likely not have a meaningful vote in corporate actions. 

18 

Our
officers and directors own over all of our super-voting preferred stock. All future actions requiring shareholder approval and the election
of our directors will be entirely in their control. 

Reporting
requirements under the Exchange Act and compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, including establishing and maintaining acceptable
internal controls over financial reporting, are costly and may increase substantially. 

The
rules and regulations of the SEC require a public company to prepare and file periodic reports under the Exchange Act, which will require
that the Company engage in legal, accounting, auditing, and other professional services. The engagement of such services is costly, and
we are likely to incur losses that may adversely affect our ability to continue as a going concern. Additionally, the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act of 2002 requires, among other things, that we design, implement, and maintain adequate internal controls and procedures over financial
reporting. The costs of complying with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may make it difficult for us to design, implement and maintain adequate
internal controls over financial reporting. If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls or discover material weaknesses
in our internal controls, in that case, we may not be able to produce reliable financial reports or report fraud, which may harm our
overall financial condition and result in a loss of the investor confidence and a decline in our share price. 

We
cannot assure you that our Common Stock will be listed on the OTCQB or any other stock exchange. 

Our
common stock is currently traded on the Pink Sheets under the symbol NUGN. Our goal is to become a fully reporting company, establish
a market price above 1.00, and be included on the OTCQB or a higher exchange, if possible. However, we cannot assure you that we will
be able to meet the initial listing standards of the OTCQB or any other stock exchange or quotation medium or that we will be able to
maintain a listing of our Common Stock on any stock exchange. After the filing of this Form 10, we expect that our Common Stock would
continue to be eligible to trade on the pink sheets, where our stockholders may find it more difficult to affect a transaction
in our Common Stock or obtain accurate quotations as to the market value of our Common Stock. In addition, we would be subject to an
SEC rule that, if we failed to meet the criteria outlined in such rule, imposes various practice requirements on broker-dealers who sell
securities governed by such rule to persons other than established customers and accredited investors. Consequently, such a rule may
deter broker-dealers from recommending or effecting transactions in our Common Stock, which may further affect its liquidity. This would
also make it more difficult for us to raise additional capital following a business combination. 

Risks
Related to our Stockholders and Shares of Common Stock 

We
are currently controlled by our principal stockholders, who include our sole director and executive officers. 

At
present, David Stybr, our CEO, owns all 100 of the issued and outstanding shares of our super-voting preferred stock, which gives him
51 of the shareholder voting power of the Company. Consequently, he can affect total control of the operations of the Company and, even
if additional shares of our Common Stock are sold, he will continue to have the ability to influence or control substantially in all
matters submitted to stockholders for approval, including: 

Electing
 our entire board of directors, which currently consists of only Mr. David Stybr; 

Removing
 directors; 

Amending
 our certificate of incorporation and bylaws; 

Approving
 a business combination with an acquisition candidate; and 

Adopting
 measures that could delay or prevent a change in control or impede a merger, takeover, or other business combination of the Company. 

This
concentration of ownership and management by itself may impede a merger, consolidation, takeover, or other business consolidation or
discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer for our Common Stock. 

Our
Common Stock will likely be considered a penny stock, which may make it more difficult for investors to sell their shares
due to suitability requirements. 

19 

Our
common stock is currently deemed penny stock, as that term is defined under the Exchange Act. Penny stocks generally are
equity securities with a price of less than 5.00 (other than securities registered on certain national securities exchanges or quoted
on the NASDAQ system, provided that the exchange or system provides current price and volume information concerning transactions in such
securities). Penny stock rules impose additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers who sell to persons other than established
customers and accredited investors. The term accredited investor generally refers to institutions with assets
over 5,000,000 or individuals with a net worth in excess of 1,000,000 or an annual income exceeding 200,000 or 300,000 jointly with
their spouse. 

The
penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, before a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from the rules, to deliver a standardized
disclosure document in a form prepared by the SEC, which provides information about penny stocks and the nature and level of risks in
the penny stock market. Moreover, brokers/dealers are required to determine whether an investment in a penny stock is suitable for a
prospective investor. A broker/dealer must receive a written agreement to the transaction from the investor setting forth the identity
and quantity of the penny stock to be purchased. These requirements may reduce the potential market for our common stock by reducing
the number of potential investors. This may make it more difficult for investors in our common stock to sell shares to third parties
or dispose of them. This could cause our stock price to decline. 

We
have never paid dividends on our Common Stock, but we plan to do so in the future. 

We
have never paid dividends on our Common Stock, but once the situation in Company allows that, we have this option as valid to discuss
on the management level and approve it. We would be delighted to share success in our projects with our shareholders. 

We
are an emerging growth company under the JOBS Act of 2012. We cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements
applicable to emerging growth companies will make our common stock less attractive to investors. 

We
are an emerging growth company, as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 JOBS Act ).
We may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that apply to other public companies that are not emerging
growth companies, including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of section
404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements,
and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any
golden parachute payments not previously approved. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because
we may rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive, there may be a less active trading market for
our common stock, and our stock price may be more volatile. 

In
addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended
transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other
words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of specific accounting standards until those standards would otherwise
apply to private companies. We are taking advantage of the extended transition period to comply with new or revised accounting standards. 

We
will remain an emerging growth company for up to five years, although we will lose that status sooner if our revenues exceed
 1 billion, if we issue more than 1 billion in non-convertible debt in three years, or if the market value of our common stock that
is held by non-affiliates exceeds 700 million as of any year end. 

Our
status as an emerging growth company under the JOBS Act of 2012 may make it more challenging to raise capital as and when
we need it. 

Because
of the exemptions from various reporting requirements provided to us as an emerging growth company and because we will
have an extended transition period for complying with new or revised financial accounting standards, we may be less attractive to investors,
and it may be difficult for us to raise additional capital as and when we need it. Investors may be unable to compare our business with
other companies in our industry if they believe that our financial accounting is not as transparent as other companies in our industry.
If we cannot raise additional capital as and when we need it, our financial condition and results of operations may be materially and
adversely affected. 

20 

We
have the right to issue shares of preferred stock. If we were to issue preferred stock, it is likely to have rights, preferences, and
privileges that may adversely affect the common stock. 

We
have designated 10,000,000 shares as Series C Preferred Stock and 4,000,000 shares as Series D Preferred Stock. As of September 30, 2024,
3,502,456 shares of our Series C Preferred Shares were issued and outstanding, and 1,957,674 shares of Series D Preferred Stock were
outstanding and issued. Each share of Series C or Series D Preferred Stock converts into 100 shares of common stock as the common stock
is presently constituted but has no rights to dividends. Upon liquidation of the Company, holders of Series C or Series D Preferred Stock
will receive such amount as the holder would have received had they converted to common stock immediately before the liquidation. The
only difference between the Series C Preferred Stock and the Series D Preferred Stock is that the Series C Preferred Stock is not adjusted
for stock splits and combinations. At the same time, the Series D Preferred Stock will have a proportional adjustment, and holders of
Series C Stock may not affect a conversion that would place their total ownership of the shares of common stock above 4.99 of the outstanding. 

We
have the right to issue shares of preferred stock. If we were to issue preferred stock, it is likely to have rights, preferences, and
privileges that may adversely affect the common stock.

during the quarter ended September 30, 2024.
