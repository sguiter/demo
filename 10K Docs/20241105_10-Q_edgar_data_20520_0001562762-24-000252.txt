 As a result of special termination benefit enhancements related to a voluntary separation plan, Frontier remeasured its pension plan and postretirement benefit plan obligations, resulting in remeasurement gains of million and million, respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. In the first nine months of 2023, Frontier amended the medical coverage for certain postretirement benefit plans, which resulted in a million net remeasurement gain. The net gain was comprised of a loss of million in the first quarter, offset by a remeasurement gain of million in the second quarter, and a gain of million in the third quarter, primarily due to discount rate changes . Pension and OPEB benefit (cost) consists of interest costs, expected return on plan assets, amortization of prior service (costs) and recognition of actuarial (gain) loss.

The 2024 Incentive Plan permits stock-based awards to be made to employees, directors, or consultants of the Company or its affiliates, as determined by the Compensation and Human Capital Committee of the Board. Available shares under the previous plan of were rolled into the new 2024 plan for a total of shares reserved for issuance. Equity awards have been issued in the form of time-based restricted stock units (RSUs) and performance-based stock units (PSUs). As of September 30, 2024, there were shares available to grant. Restricted Stock Units The following summary presents information regarding unvested restricted stock under the 2024 Incentive Plan: Restricted stock units granted Restricted stock units vested Restricted stock units forfeited Balance at September 30, 2024 
 For purposes of determining compensation expense, the fair value of each restricted stock grant is estimated based on the closing price of our common stock on the date of grant. The non-vested restricted stock units granted in 2022, 2023, and 2024 generally vest, and are expensed, on a ratable basis over from the grant date of the award. Total remaining unrecognized compensation cost associated with unvested restricted stock awards that is deferred at September 30, 2024 was million and the weighted average vesting period over which this cost is expected to be recognized is approximately years. None of the restricted stock awards may be sold, assigned, pledged, or otherwise transferred, voluntarily or involuntarily, by the employees until the restrictions lapse, subject to limited exceptions. The restrictions are time-based. Compensation expense, recognized in Selling, general, and administrative expenses , of million and million for the nine month-periods ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively, has been recorded in connection with restricted stock . Performance Stock Units We currently have outstanding performance stock units PSU that were granted in 2022, 2023 and 2024. Under these awards, a target number of PSUs are granted to each participant with respect to a three-year performance period The Measurement Period ). For the 2024 PSU awards, for example, the Measurement Period is from January 1, 2024, through December 31, 2026. The performance metrics under the 2024 PSU awards consist of (1) Adjusted Fiber EBITDA, (2) Fiber Revenue and (3) Relative Total Shareholder Return TSR ). Relative TSR is based on our total return to stockholders over

 PART I. FINANCIAL INFORMATION (Continued) FRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS PARENT, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES (Unaudited) 

, the goals for the relative TSR metric have been fully set, and the goals for the remaining metrics have been set for the first portion of the Measurement Period. The performance metrics under the 2022 and 2023 PSU awards are (1) Adjusted Fiber EBITDA, (2) Fiber Locations Constructed and (3) Expansion Fiber Penetration with an overall relative TSR modifier. Each performance metric is weighted and goals for each metric have been set for the full Measurement Period. Achievement of the metrics for outstanding PSUs will be measured separately, and the number of awards earned will be determined based on actual performance relative to the targets of each performance metric. Achievement is measured on a cumulative basis for each performance metric individually at the end of the three-year Measurement Period with a TSR modifier for the 2022 and 2023 plans. The payout of the 2022, 2023 and 2024 PSUs can range from to a maximum award payout of of the target units. The 2021 PSU awards paid out at of target on March 1, 2024. The number of PSUs earned at the end of the Measurement Period may be more or less than the number of target PSUs granted as a result of performance. An executive must maintain a satisfactory performance rating during the Measurement Period and, except for limited circumstances, must be employed by Frontier on the determination date in order for the award to vest. The Compensation and Human Capital Committee will determine the number of shares earned for the Measurement Period in the first quarter of the year following the end of the Measurement Period. PSUs awards, to the extent earned, will be paid out in the form of common stock on a -for-one basis. Under ASC 718, Stock Based Compensation Expense, a grant date, and the fair value of a performance award are determined once the targets are finalized. For the 2022 and 2023 PSU awards, targets for all of the metrics have been fully set for each performance period and the related expense will be amortized over the appropriate performance period. For the 2024 PSU awards, the targets related to two of the three performance metrics have not been established. As a result, as of September 30, 2024, we have recognized associated expense with respect to 1/3 of the aggregate outstanding 2024 PSU awards.

 The components of net periodic benefit cost other than the service cost component are included in Investment and other income on the consolidated statements of operations. The value of our pension plan assets increased million from million at December 31, 2023 to million at September 30, 2024. This increase primarily resulted from changes in the market value of investments of million, net of plan expenses, and contributions of million, offset by benefit payments to participants of million. As a result of special termination benefit enhancements related to a voluntary separation plan, Frontier remeasured its pension plan obligations, resulting in a remeasurement gain of million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and a remeasurement gain of million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The pension plan contains provisions that provide certain employees with the option of receiving a lump sum payment upon retirement. Frontier s accounting policy is to record these payments as a settlement only if, in the aggregate, they exceed the sum of the annual service and interest costs for the Pension Plan s net periodic pension benefit cost. In the first nine months of 2024, the Company recognized a charge of million to reflect the cost of pension special termination benefit enhancements related to a voluntary separation plan.

million resolving a dispute with the Chief Executive Officer of Frontier s predecessor company, who left his position with the company in 2004, concerning split-dollar life insurance benefits granted during his employment. In November 2021, Congress passed the IIJA which provides 65 billion to fund broadband connectivity programs, including broadband deployment to unserved and underserved locations. The National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) is administering the principal last mile infrastructure funding program in the amount of 42.5 billion, the Broadband Equity, Access Deployment Program (BEAD), and will distribute funding through direct grants to states, who will then award the funds based on competitive grant programs. The NTIA has allocated approximately 25.5 billion to states in Frontier s footprint. We are closely tracking implementation of the BEAD program, including participating in state address challenge and pre-application processes. We are actively pursuing awards of these stimulus funds; however, we continue to evaluate our opportunities as the process is complex and any awards that we ultimately receive under the IIJA may require significant up-front capital expenditures or other costs. On April 14, 2024, we detected that a third party had gained unauthorized access to portions of our information technology environment. Upon detection, the Company immediately activated its incident response plan, took action to contain the incident, launched an investigation with the assistance of leading cybersecurity experts, and notified law enforcement and applicable regulatory authorities. We worked with a leading e-discovery firm to undertake a thorough review of the impacted data to identify and provide notice to individuals whose information was impacted. Since the incident, the Company has also taken steps to further strengthen its information technology security. In October 2013, the California Attorney General s Office notified certain Verizon companies, including one of the subsidiaries that we acquired in the CTF transaction, of potential violations of California state hazardous waste statutes primarily arising from the disposal of electronic components, batteries, and aerosol cans at certain California facilities. We are cooperating with this investigation. We have accrued an amount for potential penalties that we deem to be probable and reasonably estimable, and we do not expect that any potential penalties, if ultimately incurred, will be material. We accrue an expense for pending litigation when we determine that an unfavorable outcome is probable, and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Legal defense costs are expensed as incurred. None of our existing accruals for pending matters, after considering insurance coverage, is material. We monitor our pending litigation for the purpose of adjusting our accruals and revising our disclosures accordingly, when required. Litigation is, however, subject to uncertainty, and the outcome of any particular matter is not predictable. We will vigorously defend our interests in pending litigation, and as of this date, we believe that the ultimate resolution of all such matters, after considering insurance coverage or other indemnities to which we are entitled, will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or our cash flows. In 2015, Frontier accepted the FCC s CAF Phase II offer, which provided million in annual support through 2021 in our current 25 states in return for the Company s commitment to make broadband available to households within the CAF II eligible areas. The Company was required to complete the CAF II deployment by December 31,

million over to build gigabit-capable broadband over a fiber-to-the-premises network to approximately locations in states (California, Connecticut, Florida, Illinois, New York, Pennsylvania, Texas, and West Virginia). We began receiving RDOF funding in the second quarter of 2022 and we will be required to complete the buildout to the awarded locations by December 31, 2028, with interim target milestones over this period. To the extent Frontier is unable to meet the milestones or construct to all locations by the required deadlines, Frontier could be required to return a portion of funds previously received and may be subject to certain fines, requirements and obligations. Fines and penalties could also be assessed to the extent Frontier were ever to decide to surrender RDOF locations previously awarded. The FCC previously classified consumer broadband internet services as information services, subject to light-touch regulation. On April 25, 2024, the FCC approved an order that would reclassify certain retail broadband internet access services as lightly regulated telecommunications services, thereby imposing certain network neutrality requirements on the reclassified internet services. Although the FCC order has been appealed to the courts, the majority of these rules were scheduled to take effect on July 22, 2022. On August 1, 2024, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit stayed the implementation of the rules. Unless overturned by the court, these rules could increase our regulatory and compliance obligations and associated costs. On July 24, 2024, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit held that certain delegations of authority in the USF contribution system are unconstitutional. The court remanded the case to the FCC. The Fifth Circuit subsequently stayed the decision to allow the FCC to file a petition with the U.S. Supreme Court seeking review. The stay allows the continued collection of USF contributions while the Supreme Court considers the case. The precise impact of the case is unclear at this time, including the extent to which the decision applies to parties other than the petitioner. We cannot predict how this or future court decisions will impact the company s ability to receive federal universal service funds in the future. We conduct certain of our operations in leased premises and lease certain equipment and other assets pursuant to operating leases. The lease arrangements have terms ranging from to years and several contain rent escalation clauses providing for increases in monthly rent at specific intervals. When rent escalation clauses exist, we record annual rental expense based on the total expected rent payments on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Certain leases also have renewal options. Renewal options that are reasonably assured are included in determining the lease term. As of September 30, 2024, we had total Accounts payable and accrued liabilities of million, of which million is related to accounts payable. As of December 31, 2023, we had total Accounts payable and accrued liabilities of billion, of which million is related to accounts payable. Although from time to time we make short-term purchasing commitments to vendors with respect to capital expenditures, we generally do not enter into firm, written contracts for such activities. In connection with the fiber expansion build, we have prioritized diversifying our vendor base and solidifying partnership agreements with vendors for relevant labor and materials, to enable our build growth and customer expansion. Some of these key supplier agreements have multi-year terms and purchase commitments as we deem advisable in order to strengthen future supply. In addition, we have negotiated favorable payment terms with some of our vendors that allow for a longer payment period than our normal customary terms (referred to as vendor financing), which are excluded from capital expenditures and reported as financing activities on the statement of cash flows. As of September 30, 2024, we had million of vendor financing liabilities included in Other

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Ana lysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Frontier Communications Parent, Inc. is a leading communications and technology provider offering gigabit speeds to approximately 3.1 million broadband subscribers, with approximately 13,000 employees, operating in 25 states as of September 30, 2024. We are building critical infrastructure across the country with our fiber-optic network and cloud-based solutions, enabling secure high-speed connections. Driven by our purpose of Building Gigabit America TM , we are focused on supporting a digital society, closing the digital divide, and working toward a more sustainable environment. Business Overview In 2020, we began the expansion and transformation of our fiber network to meet the rapidly increasing demand for data from our consumer and business customers. We believe that a fiber network has competitive advantages to meet this growing demand, including faster download speeds, faster upload speeds, and lower latency levels than alternative broadband services. In August 2021, we announced our plan to pass 10 million total locations with fiber. As of September 30, 2024, we have passed over 7 million total locations with fiber. We prioritize our activities to locations that we believe will provide the highest investment returns. As we implement our fiber expansion plan, we expect our business mix will shift significantly, with a larger percentage of revenue coming from fiber. Our strategy focuses on four strategic priorities: fiber deployment, fiber penetration, improving the customer experience, and operational efficiency. We accomplished the following objectives in the third quarter of 2024: We added approximately 381,000 fiber passings. As of September 30, 2024, we had approximately 7.6 million total locations passed with fiber. We added 108,000 fiber broadband customer net additions, resulting in fiber broadband customer growth of 19 as compared to the prior year period. In our Base Fiber Network of 3.2 million locations, we reached broadband penetration of 45.7 . Fiber broadband customer net additions continued to outpace copper broadband customer net losses, resulting in 47,000 total broadband customer net additions. Fiber revenue growth of 14 offset copper revenue declines of 9 , resulting in overall positive revenue growth year-over-year. Issued 750 million fiber securitization notes and refinanced term loan, on July 1, 2024 to further fund fiber build at a lower cost of capital, while proactively extending maturities. On September 4, 2024 we entered into the Merger Agreement with Verizon, pursuant to which, subject to certain terms and conditions therein, Verizon will acquire Frontier for 38.50 per share in cash, representing a premium of 43.7 to Frontier s 90-Day volume-weighted average share price (VWAP) on September 3, 2024, the last full trading day prior to published market speculation regarding a potential sale of Frontier. See Note 2 - Merger Agreement to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I of this Quarterly Report for more detail. Our fiber build plans include significant expenditures which could be adversely impacted by supply chain delays, actual or perceived inflation, tight labor markets, increased fuel and electricity costs, increased cost of borrowing, and other risks. In addition to higher costs, the availability of building materials and other supply chain risks could negatively impact our ability to achieve the fiber build plans we are executing against. We continue to closely monitor and evaluate the impact these and other factors may have on our business, including demand for our products and services, our ability to execute on our strategic priorities and our financial condition and results of operations.

Financial Overview Operating Income We reported operating income of 86 million and 114 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, a decrease of 28 million. We reported operating income of 267 million and 372 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, a decrease of 105 million. Operating income decreased primarily due to decreases in revenue from voice and video services, and increases in depreciation and amortization expenses, restructuring costs and other charges, and selling, general and administrative expenses. These factors were partially offset by an increase in revenue from data and internet services, as well as decreases in cost of service expenses, as compared to the corresponding period in 2023. Presentation of Results of Operations The sections below include tables that present customer counts, average monthly consumer revenue per customer ARPC ), average monthly revenue per unit ARPU ), and consumer customer churn. We define churn as the number of consumer customer deactivations during the month divided by the number of consumer customers at the beginning of the month and utilize the average of each monthly churn in the period. Management believes that consumer customer counts, ARPC, ARPU, and consumer customer churn are important factors in evaluating our consumer customer trends. Among the key services we provide to consumer customers are voice service, data service and video service. We continue to explore the potential to provide additional services to our customer base, with the objective of meeting our customers communications needs. The following section should be read in conjunction with the unaudited interim consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

Fiber Broadband Customers Our investment strategy is focused on expanding our fiber network. In conjunction with this strategy, we are also working to improve our product positioning in both existing and new fiber markets. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we added approximately 104,000 and 279,000 consumer fiber broadband customers, compared to 75,000 and 222,000 net additions for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. Customers who migrated from our copper base constituted a minor portion of these consumer fiber broadband customer net additions in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we added approximately 4,000 and 9,000 business and wholesale fiber broadband customers compared to approximately 4,000 and 12,000 net additions for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. Our focus on expanding and improving our fiber network has contributed to improved customer retention. Our average monthly consumer fiber broadband churn was 1.49 and 1.38 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 1.47 and 1.36 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. These consistent results were driven by our increased focus on key customer touchpoints such as installation and first bill as well as retention activities associated with inflation-related pricing actions and promotional pricing expiration. o The average monthly consumer fiber broadband revenue per customer consumer ARPU increased 0.91, or 1 to 65.40 and 2.31, or 4 to 65.41 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the prior year period. o The increase in consumer ARPU for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was due to customer shifts to higher broadband speeds, customers rolling off promotional pricing, inflation-related price increases, all partially offset by increased retention activity and autopay take rates. Copper Broadband Customers For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we lost approximately 55,000 and 156,000 consumer copper broadband customers compared to a loss of approximately 58,000 and 173,000 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, Frontier lost approximately 6,000 and 18,000 business and wholesale copper broadband customers, compared to a loss of approximately 6,000 and 16,000 in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. Our average monthly consumer copper broadband churn was 2.37 and 2.11 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 2.18 and 1.91 in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The increase in consumer copper broadband churn was driven primarily by the impact of inflationary price increases. Consumer Customers Consumer customers increased 2 as of September 30, 2024, as compared to the prior year period. Consumer customer gains were driven by net additions of fiber broadband customers, partially offset by reductions in our copper broadband and stand-alone voice customers. Customer preferences as well as our fiber investment initiatives resulted in an increase in the number of our consumer broadband customers and a migration of our customer base to fiber. We gained approximately 22,000 and 47,000 consumer customers for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , compared to a loss of approximately 9,000 and 15,000 consumer customers for the three

and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, driven by, growth in fiber broadband customers, offset by losses in copper broadband, voice and video customers. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , we experienced a net gain of consumer broadband customers of approximately 49,000 and 123,000 as compared to a net gain of approximately 17,000 and 49,000 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 , respectively . o The average monthly consumer revenue per customer consumer ARPC decreased 0.87, or 1 , to 83.12 and increased 1.02, or 1 , to 83.51 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively , compared to the prior year period. The decrease in the three-month period was driven by declines in voice and video services, partially offset by growth in fiber data and value-added services along with price increases. The increase for the nine-month period was driven primarily by growth in fiber data and value-added services along with price increases, partially offset by declines in voice and video services. We have de-emphasized the sale of low margin video products, which has historically been a material part of the overall ARPC.

Our revenue streams are primarily a result of recurring data, voice, and video services delivered over our network. Revenues are considered fiber or copper based on the last-mile technology used to connect the customer location. With our investment strategy to expand and improve our fiber network and the corresponding fiber focus of our sales and marketing efforts, we are experiencing growth in fiber revenue and a decline in copper revenue. We expect this trend to continue and accelerate due to strong fiber demand and the migration of customers from copper to fiber as we expand our fiber network.

 (1) Includes lease revenue of 13 million and 40 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 14 million and 44 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. We conduct business with a range of consumer, business and wholesale customers and we generate both recurring and non-recurring revenues. Recurring revenues are primarily billed at fixed recurring rates, with some services billed based on usage. Revenue recognition is not dependent upon significant judgments by management. Consumer For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 : Consumer revenues were up less than 1 and 2 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , as compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 . The revenue growth was the result of growth in fiber data and value-added service revenues along with inflationary price increases, offset by declines in voice, video, and copper broadband. o We experienced 22 and 23 improvement in consumer fiber broadband revenues for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , as compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 . o This improvement is a result of higher consumer fiber broadband ARPU as well as increased consumer fiber broadband net customers additions due to our expanded fiber footprint and continued focus on product positioning in both new and existing markets. We experienced a decline of approximately 16 and 13 in consumer copper broadband revenues for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 . As our copper footprint transitions to fiber, we expect fewer copper sales opportunities and will proactively migrate certain existing broadband customers from copper to fiber, both of which will reduce our copper customer base and revenues.

Business and Wholesale For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, our business and wholesale revenues were up 8 and 4 , respectively, as compared to the prior year period. This increase was driven by increases in data and internet services, partially offset by decreases in voice services revenue, predominantly in business. The increase in data and internet services was due to the continued growth of our fiber broadband customer base with a shift towards higher broadband speeds, and unit price increases in network access services. The table below presents our revenue by product and service type for the periods indicated: For the three months ended September 30, Increase Increase in millions 2024 2023 (Decrease) (Decrease) Data and Internet services 1,004 895 109 12 Voice services 301 341 (40) (12) Video services 83 104 (21) (20) Other 83 81 2 2 Revenue from contracts with customers (1) 1,471 1,421 50 4 Subsidy and other revenue 18 15 3 20 Total revenue 1,489 1,436 53 4 For the nine months ended September 30, Increase Increase in millions 2024 2023 (Decrease) (Decrease) Data and Internet services 2,934 2,637 297 11 Voice services 934 1,044 (110) (11) Video services 265 333 (68) (20) Other 250 253 (3) (1) Revenue from contracts with customers (1) 4,383 4,267 116 3 Subsidy and other revenue 48 58 (10) (17) Total revenue 4,431 4,325 106 2

We categorize our products, services, and other revenues into the following five categories: Data and Internet Services We provide data and Internet services to our consumer, business, and wholesale customers. Data and Internet services consist of fiber broadband services, copper broadband services, and network access revenues (data transmission services and dedicated high-capacity circuits including data services to wireless providers commonly called wireless backhaul). Network access services are provided primarily to our business and wholesale customers, while fiber and copper broadband are provided to all customer segments.

Our fiber expansion strategy positively impacts data and Internet services. Fiber network expansion provides faster, symmetrical broadband speeds and provides both customer and revenue growth opportunities for fiber broadband and network access products like ethernet. We believe this initiative will create opportunities for us to provide more fiber-based services to our customers. in millions) For the three months ended For the nine months ended Data and Internet services revenue, September 30, 2023 895 2,637 Change in fiber broadband revenue 77 233 Change in copper broadband revenue (28) (68) Change in other data and internet services 60 132 Data and Internet services revenue, September 30, 2024 1,004 2,934 
 Data and internet services revenue increased 109 million, or 12 , to 1,004 million and 297 million, or 11 , to 2,934 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to the prior year period. The increase was driven by growth in fiber broadband and network access revenues, partly offset by declines in copper broadband revenue. Voice services We provide voice services consisting of traditional local and long-distance service and voice over Internet protocol (VoIP) service provided over our fiber and copper broadband networks. Voice services also include enhanced features such as call waiting, caller identification, and voice messaging services. Voice services revenue declined 40 million, or 12 , to 301 million and 110 million, or 11 , to 934 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the prior year period. The decline was primarily due to net losses in business and consumer customers in addition to fewer customers bundling voice services with broadband as compared to the prior year period, all partially offset by higher voice services ARPU. Video services Video services include revenues generated from traditional television (TV) services provided directly to consumer customers as well as satellite TV services provided through various satellite providers. Video services also include pay-per-view revenues, video on demand, equipment rentals, and video advertising. We have made the strategic decision to limit new subscriber sales of traditional TV services, focusing on our broadband products and OTT video options. We are partnering with OTT video providers and expect this to grow as OTT options are offered with our broadband products. Video services revenue declined 21 million, or 20 , to 83 million and 68 million, or 20 , to 265 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the prior year period. The decline was primarily driven by traditional video customer losses, partially offset by price increases as compared to the prior year period. Other Other customer revenue includes non-recurring equipment sales, network facility rental income, ancillary customer fees, directory listing services and switched access revenue. Switched access revenue includes revenue derived from allowing other carriers to use our network to originate and/or terminate their local and long-distance voice traffic. These switched access services are primarily billed on a minutes-of-use basis applying tariffed rates filed with the FCC or state agencies. Other customer services revenue increased 2 million, or 2 , to 83 million and decreased 3 million, or 1 , to 250 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , as compared to the prior year periods, driven by 

 43 
 PART I. FINANCIAL INFORMATION (Continued) FRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS PARENT, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES (Unaudited) 

decreases in switched network access revenue, partially offset by increases in pole rentals, related application fees and equipment sales. Subsidy and other revenue Subsidy and other revenue increased 3 million, or 20 , to 18 million, and decreased 10 million, or 17 , to 48 million, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , respectively, compared to the prior year period, driven by increased grants and CIAC for the current quarter, and decreases in subsidies, and other revenue for the current nine month period.

 Cost of service Cost of service expenses include access charges and other third-party costs directly attributable to connecting customer locations to our network, and video content costs. Such access charges and other third-party costs exclude depreciation and amortization, and employee related expenses. Cost of service decreased 7 million and 39 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the prior year periods. The decrease in cost of service expense was driven by lower video content costs as a result of declines in video customers, non-renewal of certain content agreements, and decreased CPE costs. These decreases more than offset higher benefits costs and outside service rate increases resulting from higher inflation . Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses Selling, general, and administrative expenses SG A expenses include the salaries, wages and related benefits and costs of corporate and sales personnel, travel, insurance, non-network related rent, advertising, and other administrative expenses. SG A expenses increased by 22 million and 54 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to the prior year periods. These increases were primarily due to increases in marketing

costs, third party commissions, property taxes, and a settled dispute with the Chief Executive Officer of Frontier s predecessor company, partially offset by lower compensation and benefit costs, and other fees. Depreciation and Amortization For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 depreciation and amortization expenses increased 54 million and 156 million, respectively, the increased depreciation and amortization expense was driven by higher depreciation expense as a result of higher property, plant and equipment in service. Restructuring costs and other charges Restructuring costs and other charges consist of consulting and advisory fees, workforce reductions, transformation initiatives, and other restructuring expenses. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, restructuring costs and other charges increased 12 million, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to higher severance and employee costs, pension/OPEB special termination benefit enhancement costs related to a voluntary severance program, costs associated with the Verizon merger and other restructuring activities . For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, restructuring costs and other charges increased 40 million, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to higher pension/OPEB special termination benefit enhancement costs related to a voluntary severance program, costs associated with the Verizon merger and other restructuring activities, slightly offset by lower severance and employee costs . Pension and Other post-employment benefits OPEB costs We allocate certain pension/OPEB expense to cost of service and SG A expenses.

The decrease for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily driven by a post-retirement remeasurement loss of 21 million, partially offset by a pension remeasurement gain of 23 million. The increase for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily driven by a post-retirement remeasurement gain of 6 million, a pension remeasurement gain of 25 million, and a combined increase in pension benefit and OPEB costs accruals of 19 million, as compared to a remeasurement gain for our other post-retirement benefit obligation of 46 million and 38 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. Interest expense For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, interest expense increased 33 million and 141 million, as compared to the corresponding periods in 2023. The increase in interest expense was primarily driven by a higher debt balance. Income tax expense During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded an income tax benefit of 6 million and 13 million , on pre-tax loss of 88 million and 217 million. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded an income tax expense of 0 million and 1 million on pre-tax loss of 11 million and pre-tax income of 13 million, respectively. Our effective tax rates for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, was 7.4 and 6.2 and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 was 0.7 and 9.7 , respectively. The effective tax rate fluctuates from year to year and from quarter to quarter largely based on the magnitude of the company s recognized income or loss for the applicable period.

(b) Liquidity and Capital Resources As of September 30, 2024, we had liquidity of approximately 1,980 million, comprised of 1,320 million of cash and cash equivalents, and available capacity on our undrawn revolving credit facility of 660 million. On July 1, 2024, Frontier Holdings amended its Secured Fiber Network Revenue Variable Funding Notes, Series 2023-2, Class A-1 facility (the VFN Amendment to reduce the available Variable Funding Notes commitment amount to 0, with the ability to increase the commitment amount up to 500 million in the future upon the satisfaction of certain conditions, and to extend the maturity date to June 2028. Analysis of Cash Flows As of September 30, 2024 , we had cash and cash equivalents aggregating 1,320 million. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , we used cash flow from operations, cash on hand, and cash from borrowings principally to fund our cash investing and financing activities, which were primarily capital expenditures. As of September 30, 2024, we had a working capital deficit of 567 million compared to a 506 million surplus at December 31, 2023. The primary drivers for the change to the working capital deficit at September 30, 2024 were a decrease in short-term investments of 1,075 million, and an increase of 141 million in other current liabilities, partially offset by an increase of 195 million in cash and cash equivalents, an increase of 58 million in accrued interest and a decrease accounts payable of 39 million, as compared to the period ended December 31, 2023. Cash Flows provided from Operating Activities Cash flows provided from operating activities increased 279 million to 1,327 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The overall increase in operating cash flows was primarily the result of changes in depreciation and amortization and accounts payable and other liabilities offset by a decrease in profit. We received 8 million in tax refunds during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. We paid 1 million in net cash taxes during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Cash Flows used by Investing Activities Cash flows used by investing activities were 898 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to cash flows used by investing activities of 2,451 million for the prior year period, due to a decrease of 891 million in capital expenditures and an increase from the activity of purchases and sales of short term investments as compared to the prior year period. Capital Expenditures For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, our capital expenditures were 1,991 million and 2,882 million, respectively. The decrease in capital expenditures is due to lower levels of build prework and materials and supplies purchases in 2024 when compared to the prior year period. Cash Flows used by Financing Activities Cash flows used by financing activities decreased 2,323 million to 188 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the corresponding period in 2023. The decrease in financing activities was primarily driven by the decrease in net proceeds from long-term debt borrowings, an increase in long-term debt principal payments and an increase in vendor financing payments in 2024.

Capital Resources Our primary anticipated uses of liquidity are to fund the costs of operations, working capital and capital expenditures and to fund interest payments on our long-term debt. Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations, cash on hand and borrowing capacity under our 925 million Revolving Facility (as reduced by 265 million of revolver Letters of Credit). In addition, potential future sources of capital may include debt and equity (or equity-linked) financing and the 500 million Variable Funding Notes facility, subject to the satisfaction of the conditions laid out in the VFN Amendment. We have negotiated payment terms with certain of our vendors, (referred to as vendor financing), which are excluded from capital expenditures and reported as financing activities. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 we had 56 million and 263 million, respectively, of vendor financing liabilities included in Other current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet. Capital expenditures for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 1,991 million, and when including 415 million cash paid for vendor financing, capital investment was 2,406 million. We have assessed our current and expected funding requirements and our current and expected sources of liquidity, and have determined, based on our forecasted financial results and financial condition as of September 30, 2024 , that our operating cash flows and existing cash balances, will be adequate to finance our working capital requirements, fund capital expenditures, make required debt interest and principal payments, pay taxes and make other payments over the next twelve months. A number of factors, including but not limited to, loss of customers, pricing pressure from increased competition, lower subsidy and switched access revenues, and the impact of economic conditions may negatively affect our cash generated from operations. On May 22, 2024, Frontier Communications Holdings, LLC, a subsidiary of Frontier Frontier Holdings ), entered into an amendment (the 2024 Credit Agreement Amendment to its existing credit agreement that governs its senior secured credit facility with certain revolving credit lenders (the Revolving Facility which, among other things, (i) increased the aggregate amount of certain additional obligations permitted to be outstanding, including first lien debt, and securitization and receivables facilities, and non-loan party debt, from 2,500 million to 5,500 million; provided that at least 40 of the net available cash from the first 1,915 million in securitization and receivables facilities received after May 22, 2024 (excluding net available cash received from drawings with respect to 500 million of commitments of variable funding notes) is applied to prepay the Borrower s existing term loans and other applicable indebtedness, and 100 of the net available cash from securitization and receivables facilities in excess thereof (up to the cap of 5,500 million) shall be applied to prepay the Borrower s existing term loans and other applicable indebtedness; (ii) limited future securitizations and receivables facilities to assets located in Texas and/or Florida; and (iii) amended the financial maintenance covenant for the benefit of the Revolving Facility by, commencing with the period ending June 30, 2024, (a) including outstanding securitization and receivables facilities in the calculation of indebtedness and (b) increasing the maximum financial maintenance covenant leverage ratio thereunder to 5.25:1.00, with a step-down to 4.75:1.00 commencing with the period ending March 31, 2027, and continuing thereafter. The 2024 Credit Agreement Amendment became effective on July 1, 2024, when 402 million of net available cash from the securitization closing on such date was applied to prepay existing term loans. On July 1, 2024, Frontier Holdings entered into an amendment to the existing Term Loan Facility which, among other things (i) extended the maturity date of 1.025 billion of the Term Loan to July 1, 2031 ; (ii) lowered (x) the margin over adjusted Term SOFR with respect to the Term Loan from 3.75 to 3.50 and (y) the margin over the alternative base rate with respect to the Term Loan from 2.75 to 2.50 ; and (iii) eliminated the credit spread adjustment previously applicable to the Term Loan. On July 1, 2024, Frontier Issuer LLC Frontier Issuer ), the Company s limited-purpose, bankruptcy remote, subsidiary completed the issuance of 750 million aggregate principal amount of secured fiber network revenue term notes consisting of 530 million 6.19 Series 2024-1, Class A-2 term notes, 73 million 7.02 Series 2024-1, Class B term notes and 147 million 11.16 Series 2024-1, Class C term notes, each with an anticipated repayment term of seven years (collectively, the Notes ). Collectively, the Notes have a weighted average yield of approximately 7.4 . The Notes are secured by certain of Frontier s fiber assets and associated customer contracts in the North

Texas Area, in addition to those in the Dallas Metropolitan Area contributed in the Series 2023-1 Notes offering, and qualify as green bonds. On July 30, 2024, Frontier Holdings entered into a further amendment to its existing credit agreement that governs its Revolving Facility, pursuant to which 50 million of revolving credit commitments of a terminating lender were replaced by 75 million of commitments from a new lender, increasing overall capacity from 900 million to 925 million. The maturity date of the Revolving Facility will be the earliest of (a) April 30, 2028, (b) 91 days prior to the maturity of the term loan facility, (c) unless such notes have been repaid and/or redeemed in full, the date that is 91 days prior to the stated maturity date of our 5.875 First Lien Notes due 2027, and (d) unless such notes have been repaid and/or redeemed in full, the date that is 91 days prior to the stated maturity date of our 5.000 First Lien Notes due 2028. Debt Covenants and Borrowing Capacity Our Amended and Restated Credit Agreement includes usual and customary negative covenants for loan agreements of this type, including covenants limiting us and our restricted subsidiaries (other than certain covenants therein which are limited to subsidiary guarantors) ability to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness, create liens on assets, make investments, loans or advances, engage in mergers, consolidations, sales of assets and acquisitions, pay dividends and distributions and make payments in respect of certain material subordinated indebtedness, in each case subject to customary exceptions for loan agreements of this type. Our Amended and Restated Credit Agreement also contains a financial covenant which provides that, commencing with the period ending June 30, 2024, our financial maintenance covenant leverage ratio shall not exceed as of the last day of each fiscal quarter 5.25:1.00, with a step-down to 4.75:1.00 commencing with the period ending March 31, 2027, and continuing thereafter. This financial covenant is only applicable for the benefit of the Revolving Lenders (as defined in the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement) thereunder and failure to comply with the financial covenant would not cause an Event of Default with respect to any loans pursuant to our term loan facility unless and until the Required Revolving Lenders (as defined in the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement) have declared all amounts outstanding under the revolving facility to be immediately due and payable and all outstanding commitments under the revolving facility to be immediately terminated. The indentures governing our First Lien Notes and Second Lien Notes also include usual and customary negative covenants for debt securities of this type, including covenants limiting us and our restricted subsidiaries (other than certain covenants therein which are limited to subsidiary guarantors) ability to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness, create liens on assets, make investments, loans or advances, engage in mergers, consolidations, sales of assets and acquisitions, pay dividends and distributions and make payments in respect of certain material subordinated indebtedness, in each case subject to customary exceptions for debt securities of this type. The indentures governing the outstanding subsidiary debentures include covenants that limit such subsidiary s ability to create liens and/or merge or consolidate with other companies. These covenants are subject to important exceptions and qualifications. The indenture governing Frontier Issuer s Fiber Term Notes includes covenants and restrictions customary for transactions of this type. These covenants and restrictions include (i) that Frontier Issuer maintains a required reserve amount, satisfied either in the form of a letter of credit or cash held in a liquidity reserve account, to be used to make required payments in respect of the Fiber Term Notes, provisions relating to prepayments, required indemnification payments in certain circumstances. The Fiber Term Notes are also subject to rapid amortization in the event of a failure to maintain a stated debt service coverage ratio. A rapid amortization may be cured if the debt service coverage ratio exceeds a certain threshold for a certain period of time, upon which cure, regular amortization, if any, will resume. The Fiber Term Notes are also subject to certain customary events of default, including events relating to non-payment of required interest, principal or other amounts due on or with respect to the Fiber Term Notes, failure to comply with 

 49 
 PART I. FINANCIAL INFORMATION (Continued) FRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS PARENT, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES (Unaudited) 

covenants within certain time frames, certain bankruptcy events, breaches of specified representations and warranties, failure of security interests to be effective and certain judgments. The Fiber Term Notes are subject to covenants and restrictions customary for transactions of this type, including (i) that the Issuer maintains specified reserve accounts to be used to make required payments in respect of the Fiber Term Notes and pay certain reserved fixed costs of the fiber networks, (ii) provisions relating to optional and mandatory prepayments of the Fiber Term Notes and the related payment of specified amounts, including specified make-whole payments in the case of prepayments of the Fiber Term Notes under certain circumstances, (iii) certain indemnification payments in the event, among other things, the assets pledged as collateral for the Fiber Term Notes are in stated ways defective or ineffective, and (iv) covenants relating to recordkeeping, access to information and similar matters. In addition, the terms of the indenture governing the Fiber Term Notes provide that a larger portion of Frontier Issuer s available funds will be used towards the repayment of the Fiber Term Notes during a cash sweep period, which period would result from, among other things, the failure to maintain a certain debt service coverage ratio or a certain minimum penetration rate in the markets that were securitized at closing. The Fiber Term Notes are also subject to customary rapid amortization events provided for in the Indenture, including events tied to failure to maintain stated debt service coverage ratios, the acceleration of the maturity of the Fiber Term Notes following the occurrence of an event of default and the failure to repay or refinance on the applicable anticipated repayment date. The customary events of default to which the Fiber Term Notes are subject include events relating to non-payment of required interest, principal or other amounts due on or with respect to the Fiber Term Notes, failure to comply with covenants within certain time frames, certain bankruptcy events, breaches of specified representations and warranties, failure of security interests to be effective and certain judgments. In addition, the Indenture and the related management agreement contain various covenants that limit the ability of the Company s securitized subsidiaries to engage in specified types of transactions, subject to certain exceptions, including, for example, to incur or guarantee additional indebtedness, sell certain assets, create or incur liens on certain assets to secure indebtedness or consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of their assets. As of September 30, 2024 , we were in compliance with all of the covenants under our existing indentures and the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. Net Operating Losses In connection with our emergence from bankruptcy, we consummated a taxable disposition of substantially all of the assets and/or subsidiary stock of the Company. Certain of the net operating losses NOLs were utilized in offsetting gains from the disposition, certain of the NOLs were extinguished as part of attribute reduction and certain subsidiary NOLs were carried over. Under Section 338(h)(10) of the Code, predecessor Frontier Communications Corporation and Frontier made elections to step-up tax basis of certain subsidiary assets. Such Section 338(h)(10) elections will generate depreciation and amortization expense going forward, which may result in NOLs. Such net operating losses would be carried forward indefinitely but would be subject to an 80 limitation on U.S. taxable income. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We do not maintain any off-balance sheet arrangements, transactions, obligations or other relationships with unconsolidated entities that would be expected to have a material current or future effect upon our financial statements. Future Contractual Obligations and Commitments There have been no material changes outside the ordinary course of business to the information provided with respect to our contractual obligations, including indebtedness and purchase and lease obligations, as disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Future Commitments See Regulatory Developments immediately below for information regarding Frontier s known and potential future commitments related to our participation in the FCC s CAF Phase II program and RDOF Phase I auction.

 PART I. FINANCIAL INFORMATION (Continued) FRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS PARENT, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES (Unaudited) 

Regulatory Developments Connect America Fund CAF )/ Rural Digital Opportunity Fund RDOF : In 2015, Frontier accepted the FCC s CAF Phase II offer, which provided 313 million in annual support through 2021 in return for the Company s commitment to make broadband available to households within the CAF II areas in our existing 25 states. The Company was required to complete the CAF II deployment by December 31, 2021. Thereafter, USAC and the FCC have been reviewing carriers CAF II program completion data, and should USAC or the FCC determine that the Company did not satisfy certain applicable CAF Phase II requirements, Frontier could be required to return a portion of the funds previously received and may be subject to certain other fines, requirements and obligations. On January 30, 2020, the FCC adopted an order establishing the RDOF competitive reverse auction to provide support to serve high-cost areas. The FCC announced the results of its RDOF Phase I auction on December 7, 2020. Frontier was awarded approximately 371 million over ten years to build gigabit-capable broadband over a fiber-to-the-premises network to approximately 127,000 locations in eight states (California, Connecticut, Florida, Illinois, New York, Pennsylvania, Texas, and West Virginia). We began receiving RDOF funding in the second quarter of 2022 and we will be required to complete the buildout to the awarded locations by December 31, 2028, with interim target milestones over this period. To the extent that Frontier is unable to meet the milestones or construct to all locations by the required deadlines, Frontier could be required to return a portion of funds previously received and may be subject to certain fines, requirements and obligations. Fines and penalties could also be assessed to the extent Frontier were ever to decide to surrender RDOF locations previously awarded. As part of its RDOF order, the FCC indicated it would hold a follow-on auction for the unawarded funding following the Phase I auction. However, it remains uncertain whether any such follow-on auction will occur given the recent passage of significant federal funding for broadband infrastructure. In November 2021, Congress passed the IIJA which provides 65 billion to fund broadband connectivity programs, including broadband deployment to unserved and underserved locations. The National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) is administering the principal last mile infrastructure funding program in the amount of 42.5 billion, the Broadband Equity, Access Deployment Program (BEAD), and will distribute funding through direct grants to states, who will then award the funds based on competitive grant programs. The NTIA has allocated approximately 25.5 billion to states in Frontier s footprint. We are closely tracking implementation of the BEAD program, including state determinations regarding subsidy award criteria. We are actively pursuing awards of these stimulus funds, however, we continue to evaluate our opportunities as the process is complex and any awards that we ultimately receive under the IIJA may require significant up-front capital expenditures or other costs. Internet : The FCC previously classified consumer broadband internet services as information services, subject to light-touch regulation. On April 25, 2024, the FCC approved an order that would reclassify certain retail broadband internet access services as lightly regulated telecommunications services, thereby imposing certain network neutrality requirements on the reclassified internet services. Although the FCC order has been appealed to the courts, the majority of these rules were scheduled to take effect on July 22, 2022. On August 1, 2024, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit stayed the implementation of the rules. Unless overturned by the court, these rules could increase our regulatory and compliance obligations and associated costs. Universal Service: On July 24, 2024, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit held that certain delegations of authority in the USF contribution system are unconstitutional. The court remanded the case to the FCC. The Fifth Circuit subsequently stayed the decision, to allow the FCC to file a petition with the U.S. Supreme Court seeking review. The stay allows the continued collection of USF contributions while the Supreme Court considers the case. The precise impact of the case is unclear at this time, including the extent to which the decision applies to parties other than the petitioner. We cannot predict how this or future court decisions will impact the company s ability to receive federal universal service funds in the future. Privacy: Our businesses are subject to federal and state laws and regulations that impose various restrictions and obligations related to privacy and the handling of customers personal information. Privacy-related legislation has been adopted in a number of states in which we operate. Certain state requirements give consumers increased rights 

 51 
 PART I. FINANCIAL INFORMATION (Continued) FRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS PARENT, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES (Unaudited) 

including the right to know what personal information is being collected about them and obtain a copy of such information, opt-out of the sale of personal information or sharing of personal information for purposes of certain targeted advertising, and to request the correction or deletion of this information. Complying with such laws, as well as other legislative and regulatory action related to privacy, could result in increased costs of compliance, claims against the Company or investigations related to compliance, and increased uncertainty in the use and availability of certain consumer data. Video Programming : Federal, state, and local governments extensively regulate the video services industry. Our linear video services are subject to, among other things: subscriber privacy regulations; requirements that we carry a local broadcast station or obtain consent to carry a local or distant broadcast station; rules for franchise renewals and transfers; the manner in which program packages are marketed to subscribers; and program access requirements. We provide video programming in some of our markets including California, Connecticut, Florida, Indiana, and Texas pursuant to franchises, permits and similar authorizations issued by state and local franchising authorities. Most franchises require payment of a franchise fee as a requirement to the granting of authority. Many franchises establish facilities and service requirements, as well as specific customer service standards and monetary penalties for non-compliance. We believe that we are meeting all material standards and requirements. Franchises are generally granted for fixed terms and must be periodically renewed. Environmental Regulation : The local exchange carrier subsidiaries we operate are subject to federal, state, and local laws, and regulations governing the use, storage, disposal of, and exposure to hazardous materials, the release of pollutants into the environment and the remediation of contamination. As an owner and former owner of property, we are subject to environmental laws that could impose liability for the entire cost of cleanup at contaminated sites, including sites formerly owned by us or our predecessors, regardless of fault or the lawfulness of the activity that resulted in contamination. We believe that our operations are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of our financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions. There are inherent uncertainties with respect to such estimates and assumptions; accordingly, it is possible that actual results could differ from those estimates and changes to estimates could occur in the near term. These critical accounting estimates have been reviewed with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. There have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates from the information provided in Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Recent Accounting Pronouncements For additional information regarding FASB Accounting Standards Updates ASU s) that have been issued but not yet adopted and that may impact the Company, refer to Note 3 Recent Accounting Pronouncements to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I of this report for additional information related to recent accounting literature . Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitativ e Disclosures about Market Risk We are exposed to market risk in the normal course of our business operations due to ongoing investing and funding activities, including those associated with our pension plan assets. Market risk refers to the potential change in fair value of a financial instrument as a result of fluctuations in interest rates and equity prices. We do not hold or issue derivative instruments, derivative commodity instruments or other financial instruments for trading purposes. As a result, we do not undertake any specific actions to cover our exposure to market risks, and we are not party to any market risk management agreements other than in the normal course of business. Our primary market risk exposures from interest rate risk and equity price risk are as follows: 

 52 
 PART I. FINANCIAL INFORMATION (Continued) FRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS PARENT, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES (Unaudited) 

Interest Rate Exposure Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the interest-bearing portion of our pension investment portfolio and the related actuarial liability for pension obligations, as well as our floating rate indebtedness. As of September 30, 2024, 91 of our total debt had fixed interest rates. We had no interest rate swap agreements in effect at September 30, 2024. We believe that our currently outstanding obligation exposure to interest rate changes is minimal. Our objectives in managing our interest rate risk are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower our overall borrowing costs. To achieve these objectives, only our 1.0 billion term loan facility has a floating rate at September 30, 2024. The annual impact of a 100 basis points increase in the SOFR would result in approximately 10 million of additional interest expense, provided that the SOFR rate exceeds the SOFR floor. An adverse change in interest rates would increase the amount that we pay on our variable rate obligations and could result in fluctuations in the fair value of our fixed rate obligations. Based upon our overall interest rate exposure, a near-term change in interest rates would not materially affect our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. At September 30, 2024, the fair value of our debt was estimated to be approximately 11.8 billion, based on quoted market prices, our overall weighted average borrowing rate was 6.997 and our overall weighted average maturity was approximately 4.8 years. Our discount rate assumption for our pension benefit obligation is determined at least annually, or whenever required, with assistance from our actuaries. The discount rate is based on the pattern of expected future benefit payments and the prevailing rates available on long-term, high quality corporate bonds with durations approximate to that of our benefit obligation. As of December 31, 2023, the discount rate utilized in calculating our benefit plan obligation was 5.20 . As of September 30, 2024, the discount rate utilized in calculating our benefit plan obligation was 5.00 . The discount rate assumption for our OPEB obligation is determined in a similar manner to the pension plan. As of December 31, 2023, our discount rate utilized in calculating our benefit plan obligation was 5.20 . As of September 30, 2024, the discount rate utilized in calculating our benefit plan obligation was 5.00 . Equity Price Exposure Our exposure to market risks for changes in equity security prices as of September 30, 2024 is primarily limited to our pension plan assets. We have no other security investments of any significant amount. The value of our pension plan assets increased 198 million from 2,268 million at December 31, 2023 to 2,466 million at September 30, 2024. This increase primarily resulted from changes in the market value of investments of 235 million, net of plan expenses, and contributions of 108 million, offset by benefit payments to participants of 145 million. Item 4. Controls a nd Procedures (a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls a nd Procedures We carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, regarding the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended). Based upon this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded, as of the end of the period covered by this report, September 30, 2024, that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective. (b) Changes in internal control over financial reporting There have been no changes to our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) identified in an evaluation thereof that occurred during the first nine months of 2024 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting 

 53 
 PART II OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings We are party to various legal proceedings (including individual, class and putative class actions as well as federal and state governmental investigations) arising in the normal course of our business covering a wide range of matters and types of claims including, but not limited to, general contracts, billing disputes, rights of access, taxes and surcharges, consumer protection, trademark, copyright and patent infringement, employment, regulatory, tort, claims of competitors and disputes with other carriers. Such matters are subject to uncertainty and the outcome of individual matters is not predictable. However, we believe that the ultimate resolution of these matters, after considering insurance coverage or other indemnities to which we are entitled, will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. For more information regarding pending and threatened legal actions and proceedings see Note 17 - Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I of this report. Item 1A. Risk Factor s Except as disclosed in our Quarterly Report for the quarterly period ended March 31, 2024 and except for the risks noted below, there have been no material changes to the Risk Factors described in Part 1, Item 1A Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Risks Related to the Proposed Merger The Merger may not be completed on the terms or timeline currently contemplated or at all, which could adversely affect our stock price, business, financial condition and results of operations. On September 4, 2024, the Company entered into the Merger Agreement, which provides that the consummation of the Merger is subject to certain conditions, including (i) the Company Stockholder Approval; (ii) the expiration or early termination of the applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended; (iii) the receipt of certain required consents or approvals from the FCC and certain specified state public utility commissions and local franchise authorities; (iv) the absence of legal restraints prohibiting the Merger; and (v) other customary conditions specified in the Merger Agreement. While it is currently anticipated that the Merger will be consummated by the first quarter of 2026, there can be no assurance that the foregoing conditions will be satisfied in a timely manner or at all, or that an effect, event, development, or change will not transpire that could delay or prevent these conditions from being satisfied. If the Merger is not consummated for any reason, the trading price of our common stock may decline to the extent that the market price of the common stock reflects positive market assumptions that the Merger will be consummated, and the related benefits will be realized. We may also be subject to additional risks if the Merger is not completed, including: the requirement in the Merger Agreement that, under certain circumstances, we pay Verizon a termination fee of 320 million in cash; incurring substantial costs related to the Merger, such as financial advisory, legal, accounting, and other professional services fees that have already been incurred or will continue to be incurred until closing; limitations on our ability to retain and hire key personnel; reputational harm including relationships with investors, customers, and business partners due to the adverse perception of any failure to successfully complete the Merger; and potential disruption to our business and distraction of our workforce and management team to pursue other opportunities that could be beneficial to us, in each case without realizing any of the benefits of having the Merger completed. 

 54 
 PART II OTHER INFORMATION 

The pendency of the Merger could negatively impact our business, financial conditions, and results of operations. The pendency of the Merger could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and may result in our inability to hire or the departure of key personnel. In connection with the Merger, some of our customers and business partners may delay or defer decisions or may end their relationships with us, which could negatively affect our revenues, earnings and cash flows, regardless of whether the Merger is completed. Similarly, our current and prospective employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles with us following the Merger, which may materially adversely affect our ability to attract and retain key personnel during the pendency of the Merger. Until the completion of the Merger or the termination of the Merger Agreement in accordance with its terms, we are prohibited from entering into certain transactions and taking certain actions that might otherwise be beneficial to the Company and its stockholders. From and after the date of the Merger Agreement and prior to completion of the Merger, the Merger Agreement restricts us from taking specified actions without the consent of Verizon and requires that the business of our Company and its subsidiaries be conducted in the ordinary course in all material respects. These restrictions may prevent us from making changes to our business or organizational structure or from pursuing business opportunities that may arise prior to the completion of the Merger. Adverse effects arising from these restrictions during the pendency of the Merger could be exacerbated by any delays in the consummation of the Merger or the termination of the Merger Agreement. We have incurred, and will continue to incur, direct and indirect costs as a result of the Merger. We have incurred, and will continue to incur, significant costs and expenses, including regulatory costs, fees for professional services and other transaction costs in connection with the Merger, for which we have received little or no benefit if the Merger is not completed. There are a number of factors beyond our control that could affect the total amount or the timing of these costs and expenses. Many of these fees and costs will be payable by us even if the Merger is not completed and may relate to activities that we would not have undertaken other than to complete the Merger. Litigation challenging the Merger Agreement may prevent the Merger from being consummated within the expected timeframe or at all. Lawsuits have been filed (see Note 17 - Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I of this Quarterly Report for further discussion), and additional lawsuits may be filed in the future, against us, our Board or other parties to the Merger Agreement, challenging the adequacy of the proxy disclosures or making other claims in connection with the Merger. Such lawsuits have been brought by purported stockholders, and additional lawsuits may be brought by purported stockholders or other interested parties, seeking, among other things, to enjoin consummation of the Merger. One of the conditions to the consummation of the Merger is that the consummation of the Merger is not restrained, made illegal, enjoined or prohibited by any order or legal or regulatory restraint or prohibition of a court of competent jurisdiction or any governmental entity. As such, if the plaintiffs in such current or potential lawsuits are successful in obtaining an injunction prohibiting the defendants from completing the Merger on the agreed upon terms, then such injunction may prevent the Merger from becoming effective within the expected timeframe or at all. Item 5. Other Information (c) During the three months ended September 30, 2024, no director or officer (as defined in Rule 16a-1(f) under the Exchange Act) of the Company or a Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement or trading arrangement, as each term is defined in Item 408(a) of Regulation S-K.
