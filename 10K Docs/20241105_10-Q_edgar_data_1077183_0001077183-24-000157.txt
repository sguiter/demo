 reportable segments for which it recognizes revenue are (1) Clinical Services and (2) Advanced Diagnostics. The Clinical Services segment provides various clinical testing services to community-based pathology practices, oncology practices, hospital pathology labs, reference labs, and academic centers with reimbursement from various payers including client direct billing, commercial insurance, Medicare and other government payers, and patients. The Advanced Diagnostics segment supports pharmaceutical firms in their drug development programs by providing testing services and data analytics for clinical trials and research. 
 Clinical Services Revenue 
 The Company s specialized diagnostic services are performed based on a written test requisition form or an electronic equivalent. The performance obligation is satisfied and revenues are recognized once the diagnostic services have been performed and the results have been delivered to the ordering physician. These diagnostic services are billed to various payers, including client direct billing, commercial insurance, Medicare and other government payers, and patients. Revenue is recorded for all payers based on the amount expected to be collected, which considers implicit price concessions. Implicit price concessions represent differences between amounts billed and the estimated consideration the Company expects to receive based on negotiated discounts, historical collection experience, and other anticipated adjustments, including anticipated payer denials. 
 Advanced Diagnostics Revenue 
 The Company s Advanced Diagnostics segment generally enters into contracts with pharmaceutical and biotech customers as well as other CROs to provide research and clinical trial services. Such services also include validation studies and assay development. The Company records revenue on a unit-of-service basis based on the number of units completed towards the satisfaction of a performance obligation. In addition, certain contracts include upfront fees and the revenue for those contracts is recognized over time as services are performed. 
 Additional offerings within the Advanced Diagnostics portfolio includes Informatics, which involves the licensing of de-identified data to pharmaceutical and biotech customers in the form of either retrospective records or prospective deliveries of data. Informatics revenue is recognized at a point in time upon delivery of retrospective data or over time for prospective data feeds. The Company negotiates billing schedules and payment terms on a contract-by-contract basis, and contract terms generally provide for payments based on a unit-of-service arrangement. 
 Amounts collected in advance of services being provided are deferred as contract liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The associated revenue is recognized and the contract liability is reduced as the contracted services are subsequently performed. Contract assets are established for revenue recognized but not yet billed. These contract assets are reduced once the customer is invoiced and a corresponding receivable is recorded. Additionally, Advanced Diagnostics incurs sales commissions in the process of obtaining contracts with customers. Sales commissions that are payable upon contract award are recognized as assets and amortized over the expected contract term. The amortization of commission expense is based on the weighted average contract duration for all commissionable awards in the respective business in which the commission expense is paid, which approximates the period over which goods and services are transferred to the customer. For offerings with primarily short-term contracts, such as Informatics, the Company applies the practical expedient which allows costs to obtain a contract to be expensed when incurred, if the amortization period of the assets that would otherwise have been recognized is one year or less. Contract assets and capitalized commissions are included in other current assets and other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
 Most contracts are terminable by the customers, either immediately or according to advance notice terms specified within the contracts. All contracts require payment of fees to the Company for services rendered through the date of termination and may require payment for subsequent services necessary to conclude the study or close out the contract.

Amortization of capitalized commissions for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was million and million, respectively. Amortization of capitalized commissions for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 was million and million, respectively. 
 Disaggregation of Revenue 
 The Company considered various factors for both its Clinical Services and Advanced Diagnostics segments in determining appropriate levels of homogeneous data for its disaggregation of revenue, including the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows. Clinical Services categories align with the types of customers due to similarities of billing method, level of reimbursement, and timing of cash receipts. Unbilled amounts are accrued and allocated to payer categories based on historical experience. In future periods actual billings by payer category may differ from accrued amounts. Advanced Diagnostics relate to contracts with large pharmaceutical and biotech customers as well as other CROs. Because the nature, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows are similar and primarily driven by individual contract terms, Advanced Diagnostics revenue is not further disaggregated.

 patents, U.S. Patent No. 11,530,454 the 454 Patent ), and U.S. Patent No. 11,519,035 the 035 Patent ). On July 31, 2023, Natera moved for a preliminary injunction. On December 27, 2023, the district court issued a preliminary injunction prohibiting the Company from making, using, selling or offering the RaDaR 1.0 assay on the basis of a likelihood of infringement of the 035 Patent. Natera posted a million bond with the court on January 12, 2024 and the preliminary injunction went into effect. The injunction specifically allows patients already using RaDaR 1.0 to continue their use. In addition, the order explicitly allows research projects and studies that are in progress, as well as clinical trials that are in progress or have been approved, to continue. On December 28, 2023, NeoGenomics appealed the preliminary injunction to the Federal Circuit. On July 12, 2024, the Federal Circuit affirmed the injunction. On September 23, 2024, the Federal Circuit issued a Stipulated Permanent Injunction, consented to by both the Company and Natera and based on the partial settlement agreement entered into by the Company and Natera, on the same terms as the preliminary injunction. The litigation related to the 454 Patent is in discovery and the trial is expected for October 2025. The Company recorded the settlement entered into by the Company and Natera within general and administrative expense on the Consolidated Statement of Operations, the impact of which was immaterial. The Company believes that it has good and substantial defenses to the claims alleged in these suits, but there is no guarantee that the Company will prevail. At the time of filing the outcome of these matters is not estimable or probable. 
 On December 16, 2022, a purported shareholder class action captioned Daniel Goldenberg v. NeoGenomics, Inc., Douglas VanOort, Mark Mallon, Kathryn McKenzie, and William Bonello was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, naming the Company and certain of the Company s current and former officers as defendants the Goldenberg Matter ). This lawsuit was filed by a stockholder who claims to be suing on behalf of anyone who purchased or otherwise acquired the Company s securities between February 27, 2020 and April 26, 2022. The lawsuit alleges that material misrepresentations and/or omissions of material fact were made in the Company s public disclosures in violation of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder. The alleged improper disclosures relate to statements regarding the Company s menu of tests, business operations and compliance with health care laws and regulations. The Company filed a motion to dismiss the Goldenberg Matter on February 5, 2024 and the plaintiff filed its opposition to the motion on March 21, 2024. The parties are awaiting the court's ruling on the motion to dismiss. The plaintiff seeks unspecified monetary damages on behalf of the putative class and an award of costs and expenses, including attorney s fees and expert fees. On April 27, 2023, a shareholder of the Company filed a shareholder derivative action on behalf of the Company captioned Puskarich v. VanOort, et al. in Clark County Nevada, naming certain of the Company s current and former officers and directors as defendants. The allegations are substantially similar to the allegations asserted in the Goldenberg Matter. Substantially similar shareholder derivative actions were subsequently filed in Lee County, Florida and in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, captioned Wong v. VanOort, et al. and Mellema v. VanOort, et al., respectively. The court in each of these cases stayed the proceedings pending the outcome of the Goldenberg Matter. The Company believes that it has valid defenses to the claims alleged in the lawsuits, but there is no guarantee that the Company will prevail. At the time of filing the outcome of these matters is not estimable or probable. 
 Regulatory Matter 
 With the assistance of outside counsel, the Company voluntarily conducted an internal investigation that focused on the compliance of certain consulting and service agreements with federal healthcare laws and regulations, including those relating to fraud, waste and abuse. Based on this internal investigation, the Company voluntarily notified the Office of Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services OIG of the Company s internal investigation in November 2021. The Company s interactions with regulatory authorities and the Company s related review of this matter are ongoing. The Company has a reserve of million in other long-term liabilities as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 on the Consolidated Balance Sheets for potential damages and liabilities primarily associated with the federal healthcare program revenue received by the Company in connection with the agreements at issue that were identified during the course of this internal investigation. This reserve reflects management s best estimate of the minimum probable loss associated with this matter. As a result of the internal investigation and ongoing interactions with regulatory authorities, the Company may accrue additional reserves for any related potential damages and liabilities arising out of this matter. The Company was notified on June 30, 2022, that the Department of Justice DOJ will be participating in the investigation of this matter. At this time, the Company is unable to predict the duration, scope, result or related costs associated with any further investigation, including by the OIG, DOJ, or any other governmental authority, or what penalties or remedial actions they may seek. Accordingly, at this time, the Company is unable to estimate a range of possible loss in excess of the amount reserved. Any determination that the Company s operations or activities are not in compliance with existing laws or regulations, however, could result in the imposition of civil or criminal fines, penalties, disgorgement, restitution, equitable relief, exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs or other losses or conduct restrictions, which could be material to the Company s financial results or business operations.

 Overview 
 We operate a network of cancer-focused testing laboratories in the United States and the United Kingdom. Our mission is to save lives by improving patient care. Our vision is to become the world s leader in cancer testing, information, and decision support by providing uncompromising quality, exceptional service, and innovative solutions. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we operated College of American Pathologists CAP accredited and Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 CLIA certified laboratories in Fort Myers, Florida; Aliso Viejo and Carlsbad, California; Research Triangle Park, North Carolina; and Houston, Texas; and a CAP accredited full-service, sample-processing laboratory in Cambridge, United Kingdom. We also have several, small, non-processing laboratory locations across the United States for providing analysis services. We currently offer the following types of testing services: 
 Cytogenetics karyotype analysis the study of normal and abnormal chromosomes and their relationship to disease. Cytogenetics involves analyzing the chromosome structure to identify changes from patterns seen in normal chromosomes. Cytogenetic studies are often performed to provide diagnostic, prognostic and occasionally predictive information for patients with hematological malignancies. 
 Fluorescence In-Situ Hybridization FISH a molecular cytogenetic technique that focuses on detecting and localizing the presence or absence of specific DNA sequences and genes on chromosomes. The technique uses fluorescent probes that bind to only those parts of the chromosome with which they show a high degree of sequence similarity. Fluorescence microscopy is used to visualize the fluorescent probes bound to the chromosomes. FISH can be used to help identify numerous types of gene alterations, including amplifications, deletions, and translocations. 
 Flow cytometry a technique utilized to measure the characteristics of cell populations. Typically performed on liquid samples such as peripheral blood and bone marrow aspirate, it may also be performed on solid tissue samples such as lymph nodes following additional processing steps. Cells are labeled with selective fluorescent antibodies and analyzed as they flow in a fluid stream through a beam of light. The properties measured in these antibodies include the relative size, relative granularity or internal complexity, and relative fluorescence intensity. These fluorescent antibodies bind to specific cellular antigens and are used to identify abnormal and/or malignant cell populations. Flow cytometry is typically utilized in diagnosing a wide variety of hematopoietic and lymphoid neoplasms. Flow cytometry is also used to monitor patients during the course of therapy to identify extremely low levels of residual malignant cells, known as minimal residual disease MRD monitoring. 
 Immunohistochemistry IHC and Digital Imaging the process of localizing cellular proteins in tissue sections and relies on the principle of antigen-antibody binding. IHC is widely used in the diagnosis of abnormal cells such as those found in cancer. Specific surface membrane, cytoplasmic, or nuclear markers may be identified. IHC is also widely used to understand the distribution and localization of differentially expressed proteins. Digital imaging allows clients to visualize scanned slides and also perform quantitative analysis for certain stains. Scanned slides are received online in real time and can be previewed often a full day before the glass slides can be shipped back to clients. 
 Molecular testing a rapidly growing field which includes a broad range of laboratory techniques utilized in cancer testing. Most molecular techniques rely on the analysis of DNA and/or RNA, as well as the structure and function of genes at the molecular level. Common molecular testing technologies include DNA fragment length analysis; polymerase chain reaction PCR analysis; reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction RT-PCR analysis, real-time (or quantitative) polymerase chain reaction qPCR analysis; bi-directional Sanger sequencing analysis; and next-generation sequencing NGS analysis.

NEOGENOMICS, INC. 
 MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Morphologic analysis the process of analyzing cells under the microscope by a pathologist, usually for the purpose of diagnosis. Morphologic analysis may be performed on a wide variety of samples, such as peripheral blood, bone marrow, lymph nodes, and other sites such as lung, breast, etc. The services provided at NeoGenomics may include primary diagnosis, in which a sample is received for processing and our pathologists provide the initial diagnosis; or may include secondary consultations, in which slides and/or tissue blocks are received from an outside institution for second opinion. In the latter setting, the expert pathologists at NeoGenomics assist our client pathologists on their most difficult and complex cases. 
 Clinical Services Segment 
 The clinical cancer testing services we offer to community-based pathologists and oncologists are designed to be a natural extension of, and complementary to, the services that they perform within their own practices. We believe our relationship as a non-competitive partner to community-based pathology practices, hospital pathology labs, reference labs, and academic centers can empower them to expand their breadth of testing to provide a menu of services that could match or exceed the level of service found in any center of excellence around the world. Community-based pathology practices and hospital pathology labs may order certain testing services on a technical component only TC or tech-only basis, which allows them to participate in the diagnostic process by performing the professional component PC interpretation services without having to hire laboratory technologists or purchase the sophisticated equipment needed to perform the technical component of the tests. We also support our pathology clients with interpretation and consultative services using our own specialized team of pathologists for difficult or complex cases and we provide overflow interpretation services when requested by clients. 
 We are a leading provider of Heme oncology Dx testing, which includes Molecular and NGS testing, and one of the key providers of solid tumor NGS testing solutions. These tests are interpreted by NeoGenomics team of molecular experts and are often ordered in conjunction with other testing modalities. NGS panels are one of our fastest growing testing areas, and clients can often receive a significant amount of biomarker information from very limited samples. These comprehensive panels can allow for faster treatment decisions for patients as compared to a series of single-gene molecular tests being ordered sequentially. We have a broad molecular testing menu, and our targeted NeoTYPE panels include genes relevant to a particular cancer type. These tests are complemented by IHC and FISH tests, as necessary. In addition, we offer molecular-only NGS-targeted and comprehensive panels which combine DNA and RNA into a single work stream in order to report a full spectrum of genomic alterations, including mutations, fusions, copy number variations, and splicing mutations, as well as tumor mutation burden (TMB) and microsatellite instability (MSI) for solid tumor cases. This comprehensive molecular test menu allows our clients to obtain most of their molecular oncology testing needs satisfied by our laboratory. This is attractive to our clients as patient samples do not need to be split and then managed across several laboratories. The acquisition of Inivata in June of 2021 provided us with oncology liquid biopsy technology capabilities. InVisionFirst -Lung is a highly sensitive, targeted plasma-based assay for patients with non-small cell lung cancer, and RaDaR is a liquid biopsy assay designed to detect residual disease and recurrence in plasma samples from patients with solid tumor malignancies. We expect our molecular laboratory and NGS capabilities to be a key growth driver in the coming years. 
 In addition, we directly serve oncology, dermatology and other clinician practices that prefer to have a direct relationship with a laboratory for cancer-related genetic testing services. We typically serve these types of clients with a comprehensive service offering where we perform both the technical and professional components of the tests ordered. In certain instances, larger clinician practices have begun to internalize pathology interpretation services, and our tech-only service offering allows these larger clinician practices to also participate in the diagnostic process by performing the PC interpretation services on TC testing performed by us. In these instances we will typically provide all of the more complex, molecular testing services. 
 Advanced Diagnostics Segment 
 Our Advanced Diagnostics revenue consists of three revenue streams: 
 Clinical trials and research; 
 Validation laboratory services; and 
 Informatics. 
 Our Advanced Diagnostics segment supports pharmaceutical firms in their drug development programs by supporting various clinical trials and research. This portion of our business often involves working with the pharmaceutical firms sponsors on study design as well as performing the required testing. Our medical team often advises the sponsor and works closely with them as specimens are received from the enrolled sites. We also work on developing tests that will be used as part of a companion diagnostic to determine patients responses to a particular drug. As studies unfold, our clinical trials team reports the data and often provides key analysis and insights back to the sponsors. 
 Our Advanced Diagnostics segment provides comprehensive testing services in support of our pharmaceutical clients oncology programs from discovery to commercialization. In biomarker discovery, our aim is to help our customers discover the right content. We help our customers develop a biomarker hypothesis by recommending an optimal platform for molecular screening 
 26 

NEOGENOMICS, INC. 
 MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

and backing our discovery tools with the informatics to capture meaningful data. In other pre-clinical and non-clinical work, we can use our platforms to characterize markers of interest. Moving from discovery to development, we seek to help our customers refine their biomarker strategy and, if applicable, develop a companion diagnostic pathway using the optimal technology for large-scale clinical trial testing. 
 Whether serving as the single contract research organization or partnering with one, our Advanced Diagnostics team provides significant technical expertise, working closely with our customers to support each stage of clinical trial development. Each trial we support comes with rapid turnaround time, dedicated project management and quality assurance oversight. We have experience in supporting submissions to the Federal Drug Administration FDA for companion diagnostics. Our Advanced Diagnostics strategy is focused on helping to bring more effective oncology treatments to market through providing world-class laboratory services in oncology to key pharmaceutical companies in the industry. 
 We believe that we are well positioned to service sponsors across the full continuum of the drug development process. Our Advanced Diagnostics team can work with these sponsors during the basic research and development phase as compounds come out of translational research departments, as well as work with clients from Phase I, Phase II and Phase III clinical trials as the sponsors work to demonstrate the efficacy of their drugs. The laboratory biomarker tests that are developed during this process may become companion diagnostic CDx tests that will be used on patients to determine if they could respond to a certain therapy. We are able to offer these CDx tests to the market immediately after FDA approval as part of our Day 1 readiness program. This ability helps to speed the commercialization of a drug and can enable sponsors to reach patients through our broad distribution channel in the Clinical Services segment. 
 We are committed to connecting patients with life-altering therapies and trials. In carrying out these commitments, we aim to provide transparency and choice to patients regarding the handling and use of their data through our Notice of Privacy Practices and have invested in leading technologies to secure the data we maintain. We are continuing to develop and broaden our informatics and data-related tools to leverage our unique market position and oncology expertise to help our stakeholders solve real-world problems such as identifying patients for clinical trials or providing clinical decision support tools for physicians and providers. 
 
 2024 Focus Areas: 
 We are committed to sustainable growth while transforming cancer care for patients and providers. Our focus for 2024 is to sustain a purpose driven culture that maintains excellence in service and performance while growing through innovation. We expect the following initiatives to allow us to continue on our path to become one of the world s leading cancer testing and information companies:

Competitive Strengths 
 In addition to the competitive strengths discussed below, we believe that our superior testing technologies and instrumentation, laboratory information system, client education programs and domestic and international presence also differentiate NeoGenomics from its competitors. 
 Turnaround Times 
 We consistently focus on improving turnaround times for test results to our clients nationwide in the Clinical Services segment. By providing information to our clients in a timely manner, physicians can begin treating their patients as soon as possible. Timeliness of results by our Clinical Services segment is a driver of additional testing requests by referring physicians. Turnaround times allow for the performance of other adjunctive tests within an acceptable diagnosis window in order to augment or confirm results and more fully inform treatment options. Additionally, we believe that our rapid turnaround time on testing and our project milestones are key factors in our Advanced Diagnostics segment. 
 Innovative Service Offerings 
 We believe we currently have one of the most extensive menus of tech-only FISH services in the United States as well as extensive and advanced tech-only flow cytometry and IHC testing services. These types of testing services allow the professional interpretation component of a test to be performed and billed separately by our physician clients. Our tech-only services are designed to give pathologists the option to choose, on a case-by-case basis, whether they want to order only the technical component of testing so they can perform the professional interpretation, or order global services and receive a comprehensive test report which includes a NeoGenomics pathologist s interpretation of the test results. Our clients appreciate the flexibility to access NeoGenomics medical staff for difficult or complex cases or when they are otherwise unavailable to perform professional interpretations. 
 We offer a comprehensive suite of technical and professional interpretation services to meet the needs of clients who are not credentialed and/or trained in interpreting various testing modalities and who require NeoGenomics' pathology specialists to interpret their testing results. In our global service offerings, our lab performs the technical component of testing and our MDs and PhDs provide the professional component of testing by interpreting the results of those tests. Our professional staff is also available for post-test consultative services. Clients using our global service offering rely on the expertise of our medical team to give them the answers they need in a timely manner to help inform their diagnoses and treatment decisions. 
 Our Molecular and NGS Clinical Services segment test menus provide clients with the ability to order single gene molecular tests, targeted NeoTYPE panels that include the relevant actionable genes for a particular cancer type, as well as comprehensive NGS panels. Our Advanced Diagnostics segment offers a full range of sequencing testing including whole exome and whole genome sequencing. 
 National Direct Sales Force 
 Our direct sales force has been trained extensively in cancer genetic testing and consultative selling skills to service the needs of clients. Our sales team for the Clinical Services segment is organized into nine regions in the United States Northeast, Northwest, Mid-Atlantic, South, Southeast, North Central, West, Great Lakes, and South Central. Our sales team is focused on value-based care solutions and end-to-end client experience as a growth driver. Our Advanced Diagnostics segment has a dedicated team of business development specialists who are experienced in working with sponsors and helping them with the testing needs of their research and development projects as well as Phase I, II and III studies. These sales representatives utilize our custom Customer Relationship Management System CRM to manage their territories, and we have integrated the key customer care functionality within our LIMS into the CRM so that our sales representatives can stay informed of emerging issues and opportunities within their regions. Our in-house customer care team is aligned with our field sales team to serve the needs of our clients by utilizing the same LIMS and CRM. Our field teams can see in real time when a client calls the laboratory, the reason for the call and the resolution, and determine if face-to-face interaction is needed for follow-up. Our sales force educates clients on new test offerings and their proper utilization, and our representatives are often seen as trusted advisors by our clients. 
 
 Seasonality 
 The majority of our clinical testing volume is dependent on patients being treated by hematology/oncology professionals and other healthcare providers. The volume of our testing services generally declines modestly during the summer vacation season, year-end holiday periods and other major holidays, particularly when those holidays fall during the middle of the week. In addition, the volume of our testing tends to decline due to extreme adverse weather conditions, such as excessively hot or cold spells, heavy snow, hurricanes or tornadoes in certain regions, consequently reducing revenues and cash flows in any affected period. 
 28 

NEOGENOMICS, INC. 
 MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

In our Advanced Diagnostics segment, we enter into both short-term and long-term contracts, ranging from one month to several years. While the volume of this testing is not as directly affected by seasonality as described above, the testing volume does vary based on the terms of the contract. Our volumes are often based on how quickly sponsors can get patient enrollees for their trials and seasonality can impact how quickly patients are enrolled. Many of our long-term contracts contain specific performance obligations where the testing is performed on a specific schedule. In addition, this results in a backlog that can be significant and highly dependent on pharmaceutical clinical trial enrollment. 
 
 Laboratory Developed Tests 
 On April 29, 2024, the FDA announced a final rule on the regulation of Laboratory Developed Tests LDTs which amends the FDA's regulations to make explicit that LDT's are devices under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act FD C Act ). The FDA issued a policy to phase out, over the course of four years, its general enforcement discretion approach to LDTs and also issued targeted enforcement discretion policies for certain categories of LDTs. The FDA is allowing currently marketed tests offered as LDTs (that were first marketed before May 6, 2024) to stay on the market without requiring pre-market review and approval by the FDA. Similarly, the FDA will not require pre-market review and approval by the FDA for tests approved by the New York State Department of Health Clinical Laboratory Evaluation Program.

 Consolidated cost of revenue increased 3.7 and 6.4 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, when compared to the same periods in 2023. The increases were primarily due to higher compensation and benefit costs, an increase in supplies expense, and an increase in depreciation expense. 
 Gross profit margin for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 44.6 and 43.6 , respectively, compared to 41.0 and 40.6 , respectively, in the same periods of 2023. The increases of 3.6 and 3.0 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, were primarily related to the increase in revenue offset by higher compensation and benefit costs and an increase in supplies expense. 
 General and Administrative Expenses 
 General and administrative expenses consist of compensation and benefit costs for our executive, billing, finance, human resources, information technology, and other administrative personnel, as well as stock-based compensation. We also allocate professional services, facilities expenses, IT infrastructure costs, depreciation, amortization and other administrative-related costs to general and administrative expenses.

 General and administrative expenses increased 5.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, when compared to the same period in 2023. This increase was partially due to a 4.8 million increase in legal and professional fees including a settlement payment for IP litigation, a 1.1 million increase in technology and equipment costs, and a 0.5 million increase in compensation and benefit costs. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of 0.5 million in amortization expense.

General and administrative expenses increased 12.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, when compared to the same period in 2023. This increase was partially due to a 9.7 million increase in legal and professional fees including a settlement payment for IP litigation, and a 5.4 million increase in compensation and benefit costs. These increases were partially offset by a 1.4 million decrease in amortization expense, and a 0.6 million decrease in technology and equipment costs. 
 Research and Development Expenses 
 Research and development expenses relate to costs of developing new proprietary and non-proprietary genetic tests, compensation and benefit costs including stock-based compensation, maintenance of laboratory equipment, laboratory supplies (reagents), and outside consultants and experts assisting our research and development team. 
 Consolidated research and development expenses for the periods presented are as follows: Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, in thousands) 2024 2023 Change Change 2024 2023 Change Change Research and development 7,684 5,285 2,399 45.4 23,190 20,182 3,008 14.9 As a of revenue 4.6 3.5 4.7 4.6 
 Research and development expenses increased 2.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the same period in 2023. This increase was primarily due to a 1.9 million decrease in research and development tax credits, a 0.3 million increase in technology and equipment costs, and a 0.1 million increase in compensation and benefits costs. 
 Research and development expenses increased 3.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the same period in 2023. This increase was primarily due to a 1.5 million decrease in research and development tax credits, a 0.9 million increase in technology and equipment costs, and a 0.7 million increase in compensation and benefits costs. 
 We anticipate research and development expenditures will increase in the future as we continue to invest in development activities for innovation projects and bringing new tests to market. 
 Sales and Marketing Expenses 
 Sales and marketing expenses are primarily attributable to employee-related costs including sales management, sales representatives, sales and marketing consultants, and marketing and customer service personnel. 
 Consolidated sales and marketing expenses for the periods presented are as follows: Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, in thousands) 2024 2023 Change Change 2024 2023 Change Change Sales and marketing 20,415 17,610 2,805 15.9 62,313 52,770 9,543 18.1 As a of revenue 12.2 11.6 12.8 12.1 
 Sales and marketing expenses increased 2.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the same period in 2023. This increase was primarily due to a 2.6 million increase in compensation and benefit costs due to the expansion of our sales force as well as higher commissions due to increases in sales volume. 
 Sales and marketing expenses increased 9.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the same period in 2023. This increase was primarily due to a 9.0 million increase in compensation and benefit costs and travel expenses due to the expansion of our sales force as well as higher commissions due to increases in sales volume. 
 We expect higher commissions expense in the coming quarters as our sales representatives generate new business in our business segments. We expect our sales and marketing expenses over the long term to align with changes in revenue and we continue to evaluate the effectiveness of our incentive compensation plans.

Non-GAAP Measures 
 Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 In order to provide greater transparency regarding our operating performance, the financial results and financial guidance include the use of certain non-GAAP financial measures that involve adjustments to GAAP results. Non-GAAP financial measures exclude certain income and/or expense items that management believes are not directly attributable to our core operating results and/or certain items that are inconsistent in amounts and frequency, making it difficult to perform a meaningful evaluation of our current or past operating performance. Management believes that the presentation of operating results using non-GAAP financial measures provides useful supplemental information to investors by facilitating the analysis of our core test-level operating results across reporting periods and when comparing those same results to those published by our peers. These non-GAAP financial measures may also assist investors in evaluating future prospects. Management also uses non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision making, planning and forecasting purposes and to manage the business. These non-GAAP financial measures do not replace the presentation of financial information in accordance with U.S. GAAP financial results, should not be considered measures of liquidity, and are unlikely to be comparable to non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. 
 Definitions of Non-GAAP Measures 
 Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA 
 Adjusted EBITDA is defined by NeoGenomics as net (loss) income from continuing operations before: (i) interest income, (ii) interest expense, (iii) tax (benefit) or expense, (iv) depreciation and amortization expense, (v) stock-based compensation expense, and, if applicable in a reporting period, (vi) restructuring charges, (vii) intellectual property IP litigation costs, (viii) CEO transition costs, and (ix) other significant or non-operating (income) or expenses, net.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 To date, we have financed our operations primarily through cash generated from operations, public and private sales of debt and equity securities, and bank debt borrowings. 
 The following table presents a summary of our consolidated cash flows for operating, investing and financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 as well balances of cash and cash equivalents and working capital: 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, (in thousands) 2024 2023 Net cash (used in) provided by: Operating activities (2,777) (19,737) Investing activities 18,322 59,512 Financing activities 3,959 3,284 Net change in cash and cash equivalents 19,504 43,059 Cash and cash equivalents, beginning of period 342,488 263,180 Cash and cash equivalents, end of period 361,992 306,239 Working Capital (1) , end of period 
 293,835 494,024 
 (1) Defined as current assets less current liabilities. 
 Cash Flows from Operating Activities 
 Cash used in operating activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 2.8 million compared to 19.7 million in the same period in 2023. This 17.0 million decrease was primarily driven by our operating results (net loss adjusted for depreciation, amortization of intangibles, and other non-cash charges) which resulted in 16.4 million of lower cash used by operating activities year-over-year and a 0.6 million decrease in cash used resulting from net changes in operating assets and liabilities. The decrease in cash used related to our operating activities was primarily driven by an improvement in gross profit of 35.8 million. In addition, timing of cash receipts and cash payments in the ordinary course of business caused operating cash flow to fluctuate from period to period. 
 Cash Flows from Investing Activities 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, cash provided by investing activities was 18.3 million compared to 59.5 million in the same period in 2023. This change was primarily due to a 40.2 million decrease in proceeds from maturities of marketable securities, partially offset by an increase in purchases of property and equipment of 7.8 million including the costs associated with implementing LIMS and the build out of our Research Triangle Park facility. 
 Cash Flows from Financing Activities 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, cash provided by financing activities was 4.0 million compared to 3.3 million in the same period in 2023. The cash provided by financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 consisted of 4.0 million for the net issuance of common stock. The primary reason for the increase in cash provided by financing activities year-over-year was the timing of cash payments for stock option exercises which can fluctuate from period to period. 
 Liquidity Outlook 
 We had 362.0 million in unrestricted cash and cash equivalents as of September 30, 2024 in addition to 25.8 million of marketable securities available to support current operational liquidity needs. We anticipate that the cash on hand, marketable securities and cash collections are sufficient to fund our near-term capital, and operating needs for at least the next 12 months. Operating needs include, but are not limited to, the planned costs to operate our business, including amounts required to fund working capital including the convertible senior notes due 2025, capital expenditures, continued research and development efforts, and potential strategic acquisitions and investments. 
 
 Capital Expenditures 
 We forecast capital expenditures in order to execute on our business plan and maintain growth; however, the actual amount and timing of such capital expenditures will ultimately be determined by the volume of business. We currently anticipate that our capital expenditures for the year ending December 31, 2024 will be in the range of 35.0 million to 40.0 million. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we purchased, with cash, approximately 29.5 million of capital equipment, software and leasehold improvements. We have funded and plan to continue funding these capital expenditures with cash.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with United States generally accepted accounting principles GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Our management routinely makes judgments and estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. Please refer to our critical accounting policies as disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 and Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, in the accompanying notes to the unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements for a complete description of our significant accounting policies. 
 36 

NEOGENOMICS, INC. 

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 We are exposed to market risks, including changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 In May 2020, we issued 201.3 million aggregate principal amount of the 2025 Convertible Notes. The 2025 Convertible Notes have a fixed annual interest rate of 1.25 ; therefore, we do not have economic interest rate exposure with respect to the 2025 Convertible Notes. In January 2021, we issued 345.0 million aggregate principal amount of the 2028 Convertible Notes. The 2028 Convertible Notes have a fixed annual interest rate of 0.25 ; therefore, we do not have economic interest rate exposure with respect to the 2028 Convertible Notes. However, the fair value of the 2025 Convertible Notes and 2028 Convertible Notes is exposed to interest rate risk. Generally, the fair market value will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. In addition, the fair value is affected by our common stock price. The fair value will generally increase as our common stock price increases and will generally decrease as our common stock price declines. We carry the 2025 Convertible Notes and 2028 Convertible Notes at face value less unamortized debt discount and debt issuance costs on our balance sheet, and we present the fair value for required disclosure purposes only. 
 The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk. To achieve this objective, we invest in highly liquid and high-quality U.S. government and other highly credit rated debt securities. Our investments are exposed to market risk due to fluctuations in interest rates, which may affect our interest income and the fair market value of our investments. To minimize our exposure due to adverse shifts in interest rates, we invest in short-term securities with short maturities. If a 1 change in interest rates were to have occurred on September 30, 2024, this change would not have had a material effect on the fair value of our investment portfolio as of that date. Due to the short holding period of our investments, we do not believe that we have a material financial market risk exposure and do not expect our operating results or cash flows to be materially affected by a sudden change in market interest rates. While we believe our marketable securities do not contain excessive risk, we cannot provide absolute assurance that in the future our investments will not be subject to adverse changes in market value. 
 Foreign Currency Exchange Risk 
 We have operations in Cambridge, United Kingdom. Our international revenues and expenses denominated in foreign currencies (primarily British Pounds), expose us to the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar. We do not hedge foreign currency exchange risks and do not currently believe that these risks are significant. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. 
 As required by SEC Rule 15d-15, our management carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based on that evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at a reasonable assurance level as of the end of the period covered by this report. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Amended and Restated Equity Incentive Plan, as most recently amended and subsequently approved by a majority of stockholders on May 25, 2017 (the Prior Plan ). Both the 2023 Plan and the Prior Plan allow participants to surrender already-owned shares having a fair market value equal to the required withholding tax related to the vesting of restricted stock. Pursuant to a share withholding election made by participants in connection with the vesting of such awards, all of which were outside of a publicly announced repurchase plan, we acquired from such participants the shares noted in the table above to satisfy tax withholding obligations related to the vesting of their restricted stock. The average prices listed in the above table are averages of the fair market prices at which we valued shares withheld for purposes of calculating the number of shares to be withheld.

Exhibit 14.1 

 INTRODUCTION 
 This Code has been adopted by the Board of Directors of NeoGenomics, Inc. Company to promote honest and ethical conduct, full, fair, accurate, timely, and understandable disclosure in the Company s periodic reports, and compliance with applicable laws, rules, and regulations Applicable Laws by the Company s directors, officers and employees. This Code summarizes the legal, ethical and regulatory standards that the Company follows and is a reminder to all of the Company s directors, officers, and employees of the seriousness of that commitment. This Code applies to all of the Company s directors, officers and employees. 
 Our business is becoming increasingly complex, both in terms of the geographies in which we function and the Applicable Laws with which we must comply. In light of these complexities, we have created this Code to help us better understand what is expected of each of us in carrying out our respective responsibilities and sustaining an ethical culture. 
 
 DECISION MAKING USING THE CODE 
 While this Code covers a wide range of business activities and expectations, it is not intended to cover every situation or replace good judgement. Instead, the Code sets out basic principles to help each of us feel more confident in making the right decision. Put in more simplistic terms, the Code helps guide our decision making when we may not be certain what to do. The following questions can also help when the answer is uncertain 
 Is my decision aligned with NeoGenomics mission and values 
 Could my decision create even the perception of unethical or inappropriate behavior 
 How would I feel if my decision was made public in tomorrow s news 
 Could my decision cause any type of harm to the Company, my colleagues, the patients our Company serves, or other individuals 
 If uncertainty still exists after referring to the Code and asking yourself these questions, you should ask your supervisor, the Compliance & Ethics Team, or your Human Resources partner for guidance. 
 
 OUR RESPONSIBILITIES UNDER THE CODE 
 As a condition of employment or affiliation with the Company, all Company directors, officers and employees are required to read, understand, and agree to comply with the ethical standards described in this Code. Depending on the circumstances, a violation of Applicable Laws, our corporate policies or this Code by a Company director, officer, or employee may lead to disciplinary action, including termination of employment or service with the Company. 
 NeoGenomics management team and supervisors have special responsibilities for exemplifying the principles of the Code and creating an ethical culture. These responsibilities include helping their teams to understand the Code and how to apply it, identifying and correcting situations in which their employees are not acting in accordance with the Code, and reporting any instances of suspected or known behavior that is inconsistent with the Code and organizational values. 
 Failure to adhere to the Code or carry out business in an ethical manner is a serious matter and can result in disciplinary action, up to an including termination of employment or affiliation with NeoGenomics.

 OUR VALUES 
 Quality 
 We know that patients lives depend on us, and our clients place great trust in us. We earn that trust with every test, every interaction, and every result. We listen and respond to our customers as we seek their loyalty and trust. We constantly strive to exceed customer expectations with disciplined management, flawless execution and continuous improvement. 
 Integrity 
 Our reputation is our most important asset. We always strive to do the right thing. We are professional and honest in our relationships, and treat one another with fairness and respect. We hold ourselves to the highest legal, ethical and performance standards, and are committed and dedicated to maintaining outstanding compliance processes and best practices. 
 Accountability 
 We take personal responsibility for our behaviors, commitments, and results. Our focus is to find solutions rather than place blame. We work hard and do not take shortcuts on quality and service. We actively engage in discussions, involve others in decisions and plans, take ownership, and keep our promises. We say what we will do and do what we say. 
 Teamwork 
 We greatly value our employees, and we work together to achieve our goals. We embrace the diversity of our experiences, skills and talents. We communicate openly to engage people and to foster the innovative and collaborative culture we seek. We are passionate about creating an environment of mutual respect, continuous learning, and personal growth. We support, recognize and celebrate the success of our fellow employees. We succeed individually when we succeed as a team. 
 Innovation 
 We are entrepreneurial, and have courage in our belief that we can change things for the better. We constantly look to adapt, improve, and solve problems by offering ideas for new products, processes, and services. We encourage the best ideas to surface from anywhere in the organization. We are willing to take thoughtful and measured risks to put our ideas into action. 
 
 OUR RELATIONSHIPS WITH COLLEAGUES 
 Honest and Ethical Conduct 
 We place the highest value on the integrity of our directors, officers and employees, and demand this level of integrity in all our dealings. We insist on not only ethical dealings with

Exhibit 14.1 

 others, but on the ethical handling of actual or apparent conflicts of interest between personal and professional relationships. 
 Safety, Diversity, Harassment-Free and Anti-Retaliation Workplace 
 The Company is committed to promoting a workplace that is safe, diverse and free from discrimination, harassment, and retaliation. We comply with federal, state, and local health and safety laws and expect employees to create and maintain a safe working environment that minimizes workplace injuries and protects the health and safety of our employees and visitors. Hiring decisions are based on the qualifications and experience of the individual and comply with Applicable Laws pertaining to labor and employment. We embrace diversity and foster a work environment that is free from unlawful workplace discrimination, harassment, and retaliation. Additional information concerning the Company s employment and workplace policies may be found in the Company s Employee Handbook. 
 Background Checks and Screening 
 The Company ensures that all Company personnel, as well as outside third parties doing business with and on behalf of the Company, are subject to background checks prior to hire or affiliation with the Company consistent with Applicable Laws. In addition, the Company conducts regular screening of Company personnel, clients and third parties against government sanction and exclusion lists to ensure each individual and entity s good standing and eligibility to participate in applicable state and federal programs. 
 
 OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH CUSTOMERS AND BUSINESS PARTNERS 
 Competition and Fair Dealing 
 All directors, officers and employees are required to deal honestly and fairly with our customers, suppliers, competitors, other employees, business partners and other third parties. We seek to outperform our competition fairly and honestly. No director, officer or employee should take unfair advantage of anyone through manipulation, concealment, abuse of privileged information, misrepresentation of material facts or any other intentional unfair practice, and our directors, officers and employees should be diligent in preventing or terminating any such prohibited activity by the respective individual involved. 
 Business Courtesies and Gifts 
 The acceptance of gifts can inappropriately cause a gift recipient to put their own interests above those of the Company, our customers, and ultimately, the patients we serve. The provision of business courtesies and gifts can also unduly influence the actions of our customers and business partners and create unfair business advantages in the market. Our directors, officers, and employees are prohibited from soliciting, offering, giving or accepting business courtesies or gifts which have the potential to influence decisions for personal gain over other interests. Additional guidance can be found in the Employee Gift Acceptance Policy and Commercial Code of Conduct. 
 Data Privacy and Security 
 Global data privacy laws require the Company to ensure the privacy and security of personally identifiable information PII of patients, employees, business partners, and clients it receives and maintains in the course of providing our services. These laws also specify individuals rights of access and control of their PII, and we have implemented mechanisms to comply with those requirements. It is important that all Company personnel and business partners who have or may have access to PII as part of their job responsibilities or business affiliation with the Company comply with all applicable data privacy and security

Exhibit 14.1 

 requirements to prevent unauthorized disclosure of or access to PII without proper authorization. Company personnel should refer to the Company s Privacy and Security policies and procedures for additional information. 
 Business Continuity 
 Our customers and the patients they serve depend on NeoGenomics as a partner in the health care continuum. Our commitment to our mission of saving patient lives doesn t stop when disaster or other uncontrollable events occur that can impact our business. For this reason, we implement plans to quickly protect our people, our operations, and fulfill our commitments to our customers and patients during unexpected and sudden changes in the operating environment. 
 
 OUR OBLIGATIONS TO THE COMPANY 
 Conflicts of Interest 
 Our directors, officers and employees should not be involved in any activity that creates or gives the appearance of a conflict of interest between their personal interests and the interests of the Company. A conflict of interest occurs when an individual s private interest interferes in any way or may appear to interfere with the interests of the Company as a whole. 
 A conflict situation can arise when a director, officer or employee takes actions or has interests that may make it difficult to perform his or her work for the Company objectively and effectively. Conflicts of interest may also arise when a director, officer or employee, or a member of his or her family, receives an improper personal benefit as a result of his or her position with the Company. It may be a conflict of interest for a director, officer or employee to work simultaneously for a competitor, customer or supplier. The best policy is to avoid any direct or indirect business connection with our customers, suppliers, partners or competitors, except on the Company s behalf. All directors, officers, and employees are required to complete a Conflict of Interest Attestation form upon hire or affiliation with the Company and, then, at least annually and or if a situation where an actual or potential conflict arises. 
 Without limiting the generality of this Code s prohibition on conflicts of interest by directors, officers and employees, examples of conflicts of interest include, but are not limited to 
 Engaging in outside employment with a competitor while simultaneously employed with the Company without the prior written consent of the Company. 
 Using the Company s time or assets for personal benefit 
 Accepting, directly or indirectly, gifts, loans, services or entertainment of more than nominal value, from a competitor, customer, supplier, or other party doing or seeking to do business with the Company 
 Acquiring any interest or asset of any kind for the purpose of selling or leasing it to the Company 
 Doing business with close relatives on behalf of the Company unless authorized after the relationship has been fully disclosed and 
 Failure to disclose any ownership interests in any companies in which the Company may be doing business or may be pursuing as an acquisition candidate.

Exhibit 14.1 

Directors, officers and employees must notify the General Counsel of the existence of any actual or potential conflict of interest including any actual or potential conflict of interest involving their subordinate employees (if applicable) of which they become aware. Our General Counsel will work with Executive Management to make a determination that a particular transaction or relationship will not result in a conflict of interest covered by this policy. Any waivers of this Code provision may only be approved by the Board of Directors or the Compliance Committee. If you are not sure whether a potential matter constitutes a conflict of interest, please contact our General Counsel, who will assist you in the determination. 
 Confidentiality 
 All directors, officers and employees are required to maintain the confidentiality of information entrusted to them by the Company or by its customers, suppliers or partners, except when disclosure is expressly authorized or legally required. Confidential information includes all non-public information (regardless of its source) that might be of use to competitors or harmful to the Company or its customers, suppliers or partners if disclosed. Examples of confidential information include, but are not limited to, intellectual property such as trade secrets, patents, trademarks, business, marketing and financial plans, databases, client lists, price lists, internal policies and procedures, testing validation documentation, internal audit results and copyrights, as well as business, marketing and service plans, fee schedules, contracts, engineering and manufacturing ideas, designs, databases, records, and any unpublished financial data and reports. Unauthorized use or distribution of this information would violate Company policy, could be illegal and may result in civil or even criminal penalties. In addition, each director, officer and employee is required to abide by the Confidentiality Agreement they signed in connection with their employment or service with the Company. 
 Use of Company Assets 
 All directors, officers and employees are required to protect the Company s assets and ensure their efficient use. Theft, carelessness and waste have a direct impact on the Company s profitability. Any suspected incident of asset misuse, fraud or theft should be immediately reported for investigation. Company equipment should not be used for non-Company business, though incidental personal use may be permitted. 
 External Communications and Social Media 
 If an employee is contacted to discuss the Company s business with the media, investors or market analysts, the employee should refrain from providing information and refer the caller to the Company s Vice President of Investor Relations. 
 Social media should never be used in a way that violates this Code, the Company s policies, or the Company s obligations regarding patient information and the clients the Company serves. If the social media activity of a Company director, officer or employee would violate any of the Company s policies in another forum, it will also violate them in an online forum. Company directors, officers and employees may not post on social networking sites or blogs information that violates the Company s confidentiality and proprietary right policies, including confidential or unpublished financial information regarding the Company or patient information or the clients we serve. Communication of this type is forbidden and could result in immediate termination.

 Political Activities

 Employees engaging in political activity will do so as private citizens and not as representatives of the Company or with the use of any of the Company s funds, assets, or other Company resources.

 Insider Trading 
 Our directors, officers and employees who have access to material, nonpublic information about the Company or another company learned in the course of services as a director, officer or employee of the Company are not permitted to use or share that information for stock trading purposes. Such non-public information should be considered confidential information. To use non-public information for personal financial benefit or to tip others who might make an investment decision on the basis of this information is not only unethical but also illegal. All directors, officers and employees are required to comply with our Insider Trading Policy and are reminded that trading in the Company s stock during certain black-out periods is prohibited. 
 
 OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH THE REGULATORY AUTHORITIES 
 Compliance with Applicable Laws 
 We are committed to full compliance with all Applicable Laws, rules and regulations pertaining to our business. Meeting these requirements is imperative to sustaining our ethical culture and upholding our Value of Integrity. 
 Prevention of Fraud and Abuse 
 The Federal False Claims Act prohibits individuals and entities participating in federal health care programs from submitting false or fraudulent claims or make false statements in order to obtain payment from, or avoid making payments owed to, the federal government. 
 The Federal Anti-kickback Statute AKS generally prohibits the offering or receiving of any remuneration, in cash or kind, in order to induce the referral of federal health care program business. The Federal Stark Law prohibits physicians from referring Medicare patients for designated health care services, such as clinical laboratory testing, to entities in which they have a financial interest. Many states have similar physician self-referral and AKS statutes, as such prohibited practices seek to interfere with objective medical decision-making and promote overutilization of health care items and services. 
 Depending on the circumstances, violation of these and other health care laws could subject the Company and Company personnel to civil and criminal penalties and fines. Accordingly, 
 It is the user's responsibility to ensure the latest revision of this document is utilized. 
 Property of NeoGenomics. May not be used, divulged, published, or otherwise disclosed without the consent of NeoGenomics. 

Exhibit 14.1 

 to ensure the Company s compliance with applicable fraud and abuse laws, all Company personnel must ensure that the Company maintains accuracy in the submission of claims for its services. This includes ensuring that the Company only bills for services that are actually rendered, are medically necessary, contain correct billing codes, and are not duplicative. In addition, the Company should ensure that all of its relationships with physicians and other health care referral sources are in compliance with such laws or meet applicable exceptions and safe harbors. 
 Antibribery and Anticorruption 
 In order to promote fairness and ethical conduct in the marketplace, employees and company agents are trained and expected to follow policies supporting applicable requirements of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the UK Bribery Act, and other similar laws in the countries in which NeoGenomics operates its business. It is unlawful for NeoGenomics personnel and agents to offer or make payment or any other inducement or accept or receive any prohibited payment to improperly influence the official conduct of a foreign official or other covered person. 
 Research and Development and Clinical Research 
 Whether we are conducting our own research activities to develop new live saving technologies or we are providing services to a customer to support their own clinical research and trials, we implement processes to ensure human subject rights are strictly observed, we share true, accurate, and fair information that can help advance the practice of medicine, and we do not tolerate scientific misconduct of any kind. All employees involved in research or development activities at NeoGenomics are expected to act ethically and with integrity at all times while performing their duties. 
 Environmental Protection and Sustainability 
 NeoGenomics is committed to playing an active role in creating a better, more sustainable planet. We recognize that in our work to improve patient testing, we must also contribute to a stable climate, clean water supplies, and clear skies. A healthy environment and stable climate create a strong foundation to better withstand and prevent threats to human health. NeoGenomics complies with applicable local, state and federal environmental policies, laws, and regulations, and expects our suppliers and contractors to do the same. NeoGenomics practices responsible sourcing of products that reduce consumption and waste of natural resources and participates in recycling and other green activities. We have implemented programs to comply with the environmental laws governing our facilities and monitor adherence to these requirements regularly. NeoGenomics measures our greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, energy consumption, and water usage in order to establish reduction targets. We have also established waste disposal guidelines to divert waste out of landfills and into waste energy recovery. For more detailed information on NeoGenomics commitment to sustainability, refer to our ESG Report under the Governance section of our Investor Relations site at ir.neogenomics.com. 
 Changing Regulatory Environment 
 As the Company continues to grow in an ever-changing regulatory environment and increases its collaboration with other companies conducting business globally, we need to understand and comply with national and local laws of the countries within which we operate. Examples of such laws include those pertaining to immigration, customs, tax and exchange, and export control. As non-compliance with these and other applicable international laws may subject the Company and Company personnel to potential civil and or criminal liability, constant learning, awareness, and adherence to changes in the laws governing our business is a strict condition of employment or affiliation with the Company.
