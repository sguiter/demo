properties (including properties classified as held for sale and unconsolidated properties). Our company is headquartered in Chicago, Illinois with additional corporate offices in Louisville, Kentucky and New York, New York. 
 
 We elected to be taxed as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code (the Code ), commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 1999. Provided we qualify for taxation as a REIT, we generally will not be required to pay U.S. federal corporate income taxes on our REIT taxable income that is currently distributed to our stockholders. In order to maintain our qualification as a REIT, we must satisfy a number of highly technical requirements, which impact how we invest in, operate or manage our assets. 
 
 We operate through reportable business segments: senior housing operating portfolio, which we also refer to as SHOP, outpatient medical and research portfolio, which we also refer to as OM R, and triple-net leased properties, which we also refer to as NNN. Non-segment assets consist primarily of corporate assets, including cash, restricted cash, loans receivable and investments and miscellaneous accounts receivable as well as investments in unconsolidated entities. Our investments in unconsolidated entities include investments made through our third-party institutional capital management business, Ventas Investment Management VIM ). Through VIM, we partner with third-party institutional investors to invest in real estate through various joint ventures and other co-investment vehicles where we are the sponsor or general partner, including our open-ended investment vehicle, the Ventas Life Science Healthcare Real Estate Fund. 
 
 Our chief operating decision maker evaluates performance of the combined properties in each reportable segment and determines how to allocate resources to these segments based on net operating income NOI for each segment. See Note 16 Segment Information. For a discussion of our definition of NOI and for a reconciliation of NOI to our net income attributable to common stockholders, as computed in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles GAAP ), see Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Non-GAAP Financial Measures.

See Non-GAAP Financial Measures included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional disclosure and a reconciliation of net income attributable to common stockholders, as computed in accordance with GAAP, to NOI. 
 (2) NOI for non-segment includes management fees and promote revenues, net of expenses related to our third-party institutional capital management business, income from loans and investments and corporate-level expenses not directly attributable to any of our reportable business segments.

 Exchangeable Senior Notes 
 
 In June 2023, Ventas Realty issued million aggregate principal amount of its Exchangeable Senior Notes due 2026 (the Exchangeable Notes in a private placement.

shares of our common stock per 1,000 principal amount of Exchangeable Notes (equivalent to an initial exchange price of approximately per share of common stock). The initial exchange rate is subject to adjustment, including in the event of the payment of a quarterly dividend in excess of per share, but will not be adjusted for any accrued and unpaid interest. Upon exchange of the Exchangeable Notes, Ventas Realty will pay cash up to the aggregate principal amount of the Exchangeable Notes to be exchanged and pay or deliver (or cause to be delivered), as the case may be, cash, shares of common stock or a combination of cash and shares of common stock, at Ventas Realty s election, in respect of the remainder, if any, of its exchange obligation in excess of the aggregate principal amount of the Exchangeable Notes being exchanged. Prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding March 1, 2026, the Exchangeable Notes will be exchangeable at the option of the noteholders only upon the satisfaction of specified conditions and during certain periods described in the indenture governing the Exchangeable Notes. On or after March 1, 2026, until the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the maturity date, the Exchangeable Notes will be exchangeable at the option of the noteholders at any time regardless of these conditions or periods. 
 
 We have evaluated and concluded that the exchange options embedded in our exchangeable senior notes are eligible for the entity s own equity scope exception from ASC 815 and therefore, do not need to be bifurcated. Accordingly, we record our exchangeable senior notes as liabilities (included in senior notes payable and other debt on our Consolidated Balance Sheets).

 Derivatives and Hedging 
 
 In the normal course of our business, interest rate fluctuations affect future cash flows under our variable rate debt obligations, loans receivable and marketable debt securities, and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations affect our operating results. We follow established risk management policies and procedures, including the use of derivative instruments, to mitigate the impact of these risks. 
 
 We do not use derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes, and we have a policy of entering into contracts only with major financial institutions based upon their credit ratings and other factors. When considered together with the underlying exposure that the derivative is designed to hedge, we do not expect that the use of derivatives in this manner would have any material adverse effect on our future financial condition or results of operations. 
 
 Periodically, we enter into and designate interest rate locks to partially hedge the risk of changes in interest payments attributable to increases in the benchmark interest rate during the period leading up to the probable issuance of fixed-rate debt. We designate our interest rate locks as cash flow hedges. Gains and losses when we settle our interest rate locks are amortized over the life of the related debt and recorded in interest expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, our variable rate debt obligations of billion reflect, in part, the effect of million notional amount of interest rate swaps with maturities in March 2027, that effectively convert fixed rate debt to variable rate debt. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, our fixed rate debt obligations of billion reflect, in part, the effect of million and C million notional amount of interest rate swaps with maturities ranging from February 2025 to April 2031, in each case, that effectively convert variable rate debt to fixed rate debt. 
 
 2024 Activity 
 
 From June through September 2024, we entered into an aggregate million treasury locks to hedge interest rate risk on future debt issuances. In September 2024, we terminated the treasury locks in conjunction with the issuance of the million aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes due 2035.

million and a benefit of million, respectively. Our consolidated provision for income taxes for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was an expense of million and a benefit of million, respectively. The income tax expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 is primarily due to the enactment of Bill C-59 in Canada, which limits the amount of interest expense we can deduct with respect to our Canadian entities. Bill C-59 is retrospectively applied to October 1, 2023 and the cumulative effect tax of such interest limitation was recognized in the second quarter of 2024. The impact of the interest limitation was partially offset by reversal of valuation allowances recorded against the net deferred tax assets of certain of our TRS entities and losses in certain of our TRS entities. The income tax benefit for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to losses in certain of our TRS entities as well as an million benefit from internal restructurings of our U.S. TRS entities. 
 
 Each TRS is a tax paying component for purposes of classifying deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax liabilities with respect to our TRS entities totaled million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, and related primarily to differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of fixed and intangible assets, net of loss carryforwards. Deferred tax assets with respect to our TRS entities totaled million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, and related primarily to loss carryforwards.

reportable business segments: SHOP, outpatient medical and research portfolio and triple-net leased properties. In our SHOP segment, we invest in senior housing communities throughout the United States and Canada and engage operators to operate those communities. In our outpatient medical and research portfolio segment, we primarily acquire, own, develop, lease and manage outpatient medical buildings and research centers throughout the United States. In our triple-net leased properties segment, we invest in and own senior housing communities, skilled nursing facilities SNFs ), long term acute care hospitals LTACs ), freestanding inpatient rehabilitation facilities IRFs and other healthcare facilities throughout the United States and the United Kingdom and lease those properties to tenants under triple-net or absolute-net leases that obligate the tenants to pay all property-related expenses, including maintenance, utilities, repairs, taxes, insurance and capital expenditures. Information provided for non-segment includes management fees and promote revenues, net of expenses related to our third-party institutional capital management business, income from loans and investments and various corporate-level expenses not directly attributable to any of our reportable business segments. Non-segment assets consist primarily of corporate assets, including cash, restricted cash, loans receivable and investments and miscellaneous accounts receivable as well as investments in unconsolidated entities. Our investments in unconsolidated entities include investments made through our third-party institutional capital management business, Ventas Investment Management VIM ). 
 
 Our chief operating decision maker evaluates performance of the combined properties in each reportable business segment and determines how to allocate resources to those segments based on NOI for each segment. We define NOI as total revenues, less interest and other income, property-level operating expenses and third party capital management expenses. We consider NOI useful because it allows investors, analysts and our management to measure unlevered property-level operating results and to compare our operating results to the operating results of other real estate companies between periods on a consistent basis. In order to facilitate a clear understanding of our historical consolidated operating results, NOI should be examined in conjunction with net income attributable to common stockholders as presented in our Consolidated Financial Statements and other financial data included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. See Non-GAAP Financial Measures included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional disclosure and reconciliations of net income attributable to common stockholders, as computed in accordance with GAAP, to NOI. 
 
 Interest expense, depreciation and amortization, general, administrative and professional fees, income tax expense and other non-property-specific revenues and expenses are not allocated to individual reportable business segments for purposes of assessing segment performance. There are intersegment sales or transfers.

 This Quarterly Report includes information that has been derived from SEC filings that have been provided to us by our tenants and managers or been derived from SEC filings or other publicly available information of our tenants and managers. We believe that such information is accurate and that the sources from which it has been obtained are reliable. However, we cannot guarantee the accuracy of such information and have not independently verified the assumptions on which such information is based. 

Company Overview 
 
 Ventas, Inc., an S P 500 company, is a real estate investment trust operating at the intersection of healthcare and real estate. We hold a portfolio that includes senior housing communities, outpatient medical buildings, research centers, hospitals and healthcare facilities located in North America and the United Kingdom. As of September 30, 2024, we owned or had investments in approximately 1,350 properties (including properties classified as held for sale and unconsolidated properties). Our company is headquartered in Chicago, Illinois with additional corporate offices in Louisville, Kentucky and New York, New York. 
 
 We elected to be taxed as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code (the Code ), commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 1999. Provided we qualify for taxation as a REIT, we generally will not be required to pay U.S. federal corporate income taxes on our REIT taxable income that is currently distributed to our stockholders. In order to maintain our qualification as a REIT, we must satisfy a number of highly technical requirements, which impact how we invest in, operate or manage our assets. 
 
 29 

We operate through three reportable business segments: senior housing operating portfolio, which we also refer to as SHOP, outpatient medical and research portfolio, which we also refer to as OM R, and triple-net leased properties, which we also refer to as NNN. Non-segment assets consist primarily of corporate assets, including cash, restricted cash, loans receivable and investments and miscellaneous accounts receivable as well as investments in unconsolidated entities. Our investments in unconsolidated entities include investments made through our third-party institutional capital management business, Ventas Investment Management VIM ). Through VIM, we partner with third-party institutional investors to invest in real estate through various joint ventures and other co-investment vehicles where we are the sponsor or general partner, including our open-ended investment vehicle, the Ventas Life Science Healthcare Real Estate Fund. 
 
 Our chief operating decision maker evaluates performance of the combined properties in each reportable segment and determines how to allocate resources to these segments based on net operating income NOI for each segment. See our Consolidated Financial Statements and the related notes, including Note 16 Segment Information, included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 
 The following table summarizes information for our consolidated reportable business segments and non-segment assets for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 (dollars in thousands):

 ______________________________ 
 (1) NOI is defined as total revenues, less interest and other income, property-level operating expenses and third party capital management expenses. See Non-GAAP Financial Measures included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional disclosure and a reconciliation of net income attributable to common stockholders, as computed in accordance with GAAP, to NOI. 
 (2) NOI for non-segment includes management fees and promote revenues, net of expenses related to our third-party institutional capital management business, income from loans and investments and corporate-level expenses not directly attributable to any of our three reportable business segments. 
 
 We enable exceptional environments that benefit a large and growing aging population. We aim to enhance shareholder value by delivering consistent superior total returns through a strategy of (1) delivering profitable organic growth in senior housing, (2) capturing value creating external growth opportunities focused on senior housing, (3) driving strong cash flow generation throughout our portfolio and (4) preserving and enhancing financial strength, flexibility and liquidity. 
 
 Our ability to access capital in a timely and cost-effective manner is critical to the success of our business strategy because it affects our ability to satisfy existing obligations, including the repayment of maturing indebtedness, and to make future investments. Factors such as general market conditions, interest rates, credit ratings on our securities, expectations of our potential future earnings and cash distributions and the trading price of our common stock impact our access to and cost of external capital. For that reason, we generally attempt to match the long-term duration of our investments in real property with long-term financing through the issuance of shares of our common stock or the incurrence of long-term fixed rate debt. 

Market Trends 
 
 Our operations have historically been and are expected to continue to be impacted by economic and market conditions. We expect senior housing to benefit from strong supply/demand fundamentals, including robust projected demand growth combined with low projected supply growth. 
 
 The performance and growth of our business will also depend on the broader macroeconomic environment, including interest rates, inflation and GDP growth. 
 
 See Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of the 2023 Annual Report for additional discussion of risks affecting our business.

Equity Offerings 
 
 In September 2024, we entered into an at-the-market equity offering program 2024 ATM Program ), which provides for the sale, from time to time, of up to 2.0 billion aggregate gross sales price of shares of our common stock. In connection with our entry into the 2024 ATM Program, we terminated our prior at-the-market equity offering program (together with the 2024 ATM Program, the ATM Programs under the ATM Sales Agreement dated November 8, 2021 and amended February 20, 2024, pursuant to which we previously, from time to time, could sell up to 1.0 billion aggregate gross sales price of shares of our common stock. The ATM Programs have allowed us to enter into forward sales agreements, discussed below. By utilizing a forward sales agreement, we can secure a share price on the sale of shares of our common stock at or shortly after the time the forward sales agreement becomes effective, while postponing the receipt of proceeds from the sale of shares until a future date. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, the remaining amount available under our 2024 ATM Program for future sales of our common stock was 1.9 billion.

 Other Items 
 
 In September 2024, we entered into agreements (collectively the 2024 Kindred Agreements with Kindred Healthcare, LLC (with its subsidiaries, Kindred and its parent companies ScionHealth with respect to, among other things, certain LTACs whose lease term was scheduled to mature under the Kindred Master Lease on April 30, 2025 (the Group 2 LTACs ). Under the 2024 Kindred Agreements, among other things, (i) the current term of the Kindred Master Lease for 20 of the Group 2 LTACs (the Extended Group 2 LTACs was extended to April 30, 2030, (ii) the cash contractual base rent commencing May 1, 2025 on the Extended Group 2 LTACs was established at 80 million with annual 2.75 escalators through the extended lease maturity date of April 30, 2030, (iii) we were granted the right to receive additional revenue-sharing rent annually if certain thresholds are met, and (iv) we received warrants for 9.9 of the common equity of ScionHealth exercisable at its pre-transaction value. The current term for the remaining three Group 2 LTACs will expire on April 30, 2025 (the Non-Renewing Group 2 LTACs ). Kindred is contractually required to continue to pay rent on the Non-Renewing Group 2 LTACs until then. For the Non-Renewing Group 2 LTACs, there are other options we may choose to pursue, including, without limitation, transitions to replacement operators, conversions of properties to alternative uses and sale transactions.

 As of September 30, 2024, we held an approximately 6.7 ownership interest in Ardent. One of our executive officers is currently a member of the Ardent Board of Directors. Going forward, we have the right (but not the obligation) to nominate one member of the Ardent Board of Directors for so long as we beneficially own 4 or more of the total voting power of the outstanding common stock of Ardent, pursuant to our nomination agreement with Ardent. Following Ardent s initial public offering, which was consummated in July 2024, our equity stake in Ardent decreased from the issuance of primary shares from 7.5 to approximately 6.7 , which resulted in a gain of 8.7 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, which is included in income (loss) from unconsolidated entities in our Consolidated Statements of Income.

Concentration Risk 
 
 We use concentration ratios to identify, understand and evaluate the potential impact of economic downturns and other adverse events that may affect our asset types, geographic locations, business models, and tenants, operators and managers. We evaluate concentration risk in terms of investment mix and operations mix. Investment mix measures the percentage of our investments that is concentrated in a specific asset type or that is operated or managed by a particular tenant, operator or manager. Operations mix measures the percentage of our operating results that is attributed to a particular tenant, operator or manager, geographic location or business model. See Note 3 Concentration of Credit Risk included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional disclosure on the concentration of our credit risk.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 
 Our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles GAAP for interim financial information set forth in the Accounting Standards Codification ASC ), as published by the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB ), and with the SEC instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions regarding future events that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. We base these estimates on our experience and assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. However, if our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions or other matters had been different, we may have applied a different accounting treatment, resulting in a different presentation of our financial statements. We periodically reevaluate our estimates and assumptions and, in the event they prove to be different from actual results, we make adjustments in subsequent periods to reflect more current estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain. 
 
 34 

Our 2023 Annual Report contains additional information regarding the critical accounting policies that affect our more significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. There have been no material changes to these policies in 2024. 
 
 Recent Accounting Standards 
 
 In November 2023, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2023-07, Segment Reporting Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures ASU 2023-07 ), which requires incremental disclosures related to a public entity s reportable segments. Required disclosures include, on an annual and interim basis, significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker CODM and included within each reported measure of segment profit or loss, an amount for other segment items (which is the difference between segment revenue less segment expenses and less segment profit or loss) and a description of its composition, the title and position of the CODM, and an explanation of how the CODM uses the reported measure(s) of segment profit or loss in assessing segment performance and deciding how to allocate resources. The standard also permits disclosure of more than one measure of segment profit. ASU 2023-07 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. We are finalizing our assessment of the impact of adopting ASU 2023-07 and expect to disclose additional expense details and the title of our CODM in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024. 
 
 In December 2023, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2023-09, Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures ASU 2023-09 ), which requires public entities on an annual basis to (1) disclose specific categories in the rate reconciliation and (2) provide additional information for reconciling items that meet a quantitative threshold (if the effect of those reconciling items is equal to or greater than 5 percent of the amount computed by multiplying pretax income or loss by the applicable statutory income tax rate). ASU 2023-09 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. We are evaluating the impact of adopting ASU 2023-09 on our Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 
 In March 2024, the SEC adopted the final rule under SEC Release No. 33-11275, The Enhancement and Standardization of Climate Related Disclosures for Investors , which requires registrants to disclose climate-related information in registration statements and annual reports. The new rules would be effective for annual reporting periods beginning in fiscal year 2025. However, in April 2024, the SEC exercised its discretion to stay these rules pending the completion of judicial review of certain consolidated petitions with the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit in connection with these rules. We are evaluating the impact of this rule on our Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Results of Operations 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we operated through three reportable business segments: senior housing operating portfolio, outpatient medical and research portfolio and triple-net leased properties. In our SHOP segment, we invest in senior housing communities throughout the United States and Canada and engage operators to operate those communities. In our outpatient medical and research portfolio segment, we primarily acquire, own, develop, lease and manage outpatient medical buildings and research centers throughout the United States. In our triple-net leased properties segment, we invest in and own senior housing communities, skilled nursing facilities SNFs ), long term acute care hospitals LTACs ), freestanding inpatient rehabilitation facilities IRFs and other healthcare facilities throughout the United States and the United Kingdom and lease those properties to tenants under triple-net or absolute-net leases that obligate the tenants to pay all property-related expenses, including maintenance, utilities, repairs, taxes, insurance and capital expenditures. Information provided for non-segment includes income from loans and investments and other miscellaneous income and various corporate-level expenses not directly attributable to any of our three reportable business segments. Non-segment assets consist primarily of corporate assets, including cash, restricted cash, loans receivable and investments and miscellaneous accounts receivable as well as investments in unconsolidated entities. Our investments in unconsolidated entities include investments made through our third-party institutional capital management business, Ventas Investment Management VIM ). 
 
 Our chief operating decision maker evaluates performance of the combined properties in each reportable business segment and determines how to allocate resources to those segments based on NOI for each segment. For further information regarding our reportable business segments and a discussion of our definition of NOI, see Note 16 Segment Information of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. See Non-GAAP Financial Measures included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional disclosure and reconciliations of net income attributable to common stockholders, as computed in accordance with GAAP, to NOI.

 NOI SHOP 
 
 The following table summarizes results of operations in our SHOP segment, including assets sold or classified as held for sale as of September 30, 2024 (dollars in thousands): 
 For the Three Months Ended September 30, Increase (Decrease) to NOI 2024 2023 NOI SHOP: Resident fees and services 845,532 754,417 91,115 12.1 Less: Property-level operating expenses (631,550) (573,715) (57,835) (10.1) NOI 213,982 180,702 33,280 18.4

 36 

Resident fees and services include all amounts earned from residents at our senior housing communities, such as rental fees related to resident leases, extended health care fees and other ancillary service income. Property-level operating expenses related to our SHOP segment include labor, food, utilities, marketing, management and other costs of operating the properties. For senior housing communities in our SHOP segment, occupancy generally reflects average operator-reported unit occupancy for the reporting period. Average monthly revenue per occupied room reflects average resident fees and services per operator-reported occupied unit for the reporting period. 
 
 The NOI increase in our SHOP segment for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 was primarily driven by positive trends in occupancy and revenue per occupied room in 2024, the addition of communities acquired in our SHOP segment and conversions from our triple-net leased properties to our SHOP segment. The revenue increase is partially offset by higher operating expenses, driven by the additions to our SHOP segment and an increase in occupancy in our same-store portfolio. 
 
 The following table compares results of operations for our 488 same-store SHOP communities (dollars in thousands). See Non-GAAP Financial Measures NOI included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional disclosure regarding same-store NOI for each of our reportable business segments. 
 For the Three Months Ended September 30, Increase (Decrease) to NOI 2024 2023 Same-Store NOI SHOP: Resident fees and services 735,948 676,734 59,214 8.7 Less: Property-level operating expenses (542,324) (508,870) (33,454) (6.6) NOI 193,624 167,864 25,760 15.3

 The NOI increase in our same-store SHOP segment for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 was primarily driven by positive trends in occupancy and revenue per occupied room in 2024, partially offset by higher operating expenses driven by an increase in occupancy in 2024. 
 
 NOI Outpatient Medical and Research Portfolio 
 
 The following table summarizes results of operations in our outpatient medical and research portfolio segment, including assets sold or classified as held for sale as of September 30, 2024 (dollars in thousands). For properties in our outpatient medical and research portfolio segment, occupancy generally reflects occupied square footage divided by net rentable square footage as of the end of the reporting period. 
 For the Three Months Ended September 30, (Decrease) Increase to NOI 
 2024 2023 NOI Outpatient Medical and Research Portfolio: Rental income 220,957 226,326 (5,369) (2.4) Third party capital management revenues 618 662 (44) (6.6) Total revenues 221,575 226,988 (5,413) (2.4) Less: Property-level operating expenses (77,479) (78,915) 1,436 1.8 NOI 144,096 148,073 (3,977) (2.7)

 The NOI decrease in our outpatient medical and research portfolio segment for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 was primarily due to dispositions, partially offset by leasing activity, improved parking revenues and a development project placed in service. 
 
 The following table compares results of operations for our 416 same-store outpatient medical and research portfolio (dollars in thousands): 
 For the Three Months Ended September 30, Increase (Decrease) to NOI 2024 2023 Same-Store NOI Outpatient Medical and Research Portfolio: Rental income 209,421 204,307 5,114 2.5 Less: Property-level operating expenses (71,046) (68,084) (2,962) (4.4) NOI 138,375 136,223 2,152 1.6

 The NOI increase in our same-store outpatient medical and research portfolio segment for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 was primarily driven by leasing activity, high tenant retention and improved parking revenues. 
 
 NOI Triple-Net Leased Properties 
 
 The following table summarizes results of operations in our 302 triple-net leased properties segment, including assets sold or classified as held for sale as of September 30, 2024 (dollars in thousands): 
 For the Three Months Ended September 30, Decrease to NOI 
 2024 2023 NOI Triple-Net Leased Properties: Rental income 155,349 159,812 (4,463) (2.8) Less: Property-level operating expenses (4,379) (3,847) (532) (13.8) NOI 150,970 155,965 (4,995) (3.2) 
 
 In our triple-net leased properties segment, our revenues generally consist of fixed rental amounts (subject to contractual escalations) received from our tenants in accordance with the applicable lease terms. We report revenues and property-level operating expenses within our triple-net leased properties segment for real estate tax and insurance expenses that are paid from escrows collected from our tenants. 
 
 38 

The NOI decrease in our triple-net leased properties for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 was primarily driven by communities that converted to our SHOP segment and dispositions, partially offset by contractual rent escalators and acquisitions in 2024. Rental income includes the amortization of the upfront consideration received, totaling 234.6 million 2020 Consideration ), from Brookdale Senior Living, Inc. as part of the lease renewal agreement reached in 2020. As of September 30, 2024, approximately 181.3 million of such 2020 Consideration has been amortized, leaving approximately 53.3 million unamortized. 
 
 Occupancy rates may affect the profitability of our tenants operations. For senior housing communities and post-acute properties in our triple-net leased properties segment, occupancy generally reflects average operator-reported unit and bed occupancy, respectively, for the reporting period. Because triple-net financials are delivered to us following the reporting period, occupancy is reported in arrears. The following table sets forth average continuing occupancy rates for the second quarter of 2024 and 2023 related to the triple-net leased properties we owned at September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The table excludes non-stabilized properties, properties owned through investments in unconsolidated real estate entities, certain properties for which we do not receive occupancy information and properties acquired or properties that transitioned operators for which we do not have a full quarter of occupancy results. 
 
 Number of Properties Owned at September 30, 2024 Average Occupancy for the Three Months Ended June 30, 2024 Number of Properties Owned at September 30, 2023 Average Occupancy for the Three Months Ended June 30, 2023 Senior housing communities

 The following table compares results of operations for our 287 same-store triple-net leased properties (dollars in thousands): 
 For the Three Months Ended September 30, Increase (Decrease) to NOI 
 2024 2023 Same-Store NOI Triple-Net Leased Properties: Rental income 148,092 144,755 3,337 2.3 Less: Property-level operating expenses (4,299) (3,595) (704) (19.6) NOI 143,793 141,160 2,633 1.9 
 
 The NOI increase in our same-store triple-net leased portfolio for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 was primarily driven by contractual rent escalators in 2024. 
 
 NOI Non-Segment 
 
 Non-segment NOI includes management fees and promote revenues, net of expenses, related to our third-party institutional capital management business, income from loans and investments and various corporate-level expenses not directly attributable to any of our three reportable business segments. Non-segment NOI for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 was relatively consistent. 
 
 Company Results 
 
 Interest and other income 
 
 The 5.5 million increase in interest and other income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 was primarily due to interest income earned on cash invested in short-term money market funds. 
 
 39 

Interest expense 
 
 The 2.5 million increase in interest expense, net of higher capitalized interest of 0.8 million, for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 was primarily due to an increase of 3.6 million due to higher effective interest rates, partially offset by a decrease of 0.4 million due to lower debt balances. Our weighted average effective interest rate was 4.44 and 4.33 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Our weighted average debt outstanding was 13.42 billion and 13.46 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 
 Depreciation and amortization 
 
 The 66.1 million decrease in depreciation and amortization expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 was primarily due to a 55.2 million decrease in impairments, an 18.7 million decrease in amortization related to intangible assets that were fully amortized in 2024, partially offset by an 8.5 million increase in depreciation and amortization related to properties acquired or placed into service during or after the third quarter of 2023. 
 
 General, administrative and professional fees 
 
 The 1.8 million increase in general, administrative and professional fees for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 was primarily due to lower turnover and inflationary increases. 
 
 Loss on extinguishment of debt, net 
 
 The 0.6 million change in loss on extinguishment of debt, net for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to a loss recognized in 2023 in connection with the repayment of a loan prior to maturity. 
 
 Transaction, transition and restructuring costs 
 
 Transaction, transition and restructuring costs include transition and integration expenses incurred by properties that have undergone operator or business model transitions; costs and expenses relating to mergers, acquisitions, investments, leases, management agreements and similar arrangements, strategic transactions, such as spin-offs, joint ventures, partnerships and minority investments, and other transactions; and costs and expenses related to organizational or other restructuring activities. The 1.5 million increase in transaction, transition and restructuring costs for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 was primarily due to costs incurred in connection with the lease amendment in the 2024 Kindred Agreements, partially offset by higher transition costs in 2023. 
 
 Recovery of allowance on loans receivable and investments, net 
 
 Recovery of allowance on loans receivable and investments, net for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 was relatively consistent. 
 
 Other expense 
 
 Other expense includes the changes in fair value of stock warrants, net expenses or recoveries related to significant disruptive events and other expenses or income. The 5.5 million decrease in other expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 was primarily due to a 4.5 million change in the fair value of stock warrants. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recognized unrealized loss of 1.0 million and 5.5 million, respectively, relating to the change in fair value of stock warrants. 
 
 Income (loss) from unconsolidated entities 
 
 The 9.7 million change in income (loss) from unconsolidated entities for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 was primarily due to a 8.7 million gain recognized following Ardent s initial public offering in July 2024 and the resulting decrease in our equity stake in Ardent from 7.5 to approximately 6.7 . 
 
 40 

Gain on real estate dispositions 
 
 The 10.4 million decrease in gain on real estate dispositions for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 was primarily due to a net gain of 0.3 million recognized on the sale of four properties in 2024, partially offset by a net gain of 10.7 million recognized in 2023 on the sale of seven properties. 
 
 Income tax (expense) benefit 
 
 The 3.0 million income tax expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 is primarily due to the enactment of Bill C-59 in Canada, which limits the amount of interest expense we can deduct with respect to our Canadian entities. The impact of the interest limitation was partially offset by reversal of valuation allowances recorded against the net deferred tax assets of certain of our TRS entities and losses in certain of our TRS entities. The 1.7 million income tax benefit for the three months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to losses in certain of our TRS entities as well as an 8.0 million benefit from internal restructurings of our U.S. TRS entities.

 The NOI increase in our SHOP segment for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 was primarily driven by positive trends in occupancy and revenue per occupied room, conversions from our triple-net leased properties to our SHOP segment and the addition of communities acquired in our SHOP segment. The revenue increase is partially offset by higher operating expenses in 2024, driven by the additions to our SHOP segment and an increase in occupancy in our same-store portfolio. 
 
 The following table compares results of operations for our 473 same-store SHOP communities (dollars in thousands): 
 For the Nine Months Ended September 30, Increase (Decrease) to NOI 2024 2023 Same-Store NOI SHOP: Resident fees and services 2,065,939 1,909,128 156,811 8.2 Less: Property-level operating expenses (1,506,304) (1,424,996) (81,308) (5.7) NOI 559,635 484,132 75,503 15.6

 The NOI increase in our outpatient medical and research portfolio segment for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 was primarily due to properties acquired, leasing activity, improved parking revenues and a development project placed in service, partially offset by dispositions and higher operating expenses. 
 
 The following table compares results of operations for our 337 same-store outpatient medical and research portfolio (dollars in thousands): 
 For the Nine Months Ended September 30, Increase (Decrease) to NOI 2024 2023 Same-Store NOI Outpatient Medical and Research Portfolio: Rental income 562,713 545,847 16,866 3.1 Less: Property-level operating expenses (181,275) (173,550) (7,725) (4.5) NOI 381,438 372,297 9,141 2.5

NOI Triple-Net Leased Properties 
 
 The following table summarizes results of operations in our 302 triple-net leased properties segment, including assets sold or classified as held for sale as of September 30, 2024 (dollars in thousands): 
 For the Nine Months Ended September 30, Increase (Decrease) to NOI 
 2024 2023 NOI Triple-Net Leased Properties: Rental income 464,651 463,906 745 0.2 Less: Property-level operating expenses (11,623) (11,180) (443) (4.0) NOI 453,028 452,726 302 0.1 
 
 The NOI increase in our triple-net leased properties for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 was primarily driven by acquisitions and contractual rent escalators, partially offset by rental income from communities that converted to our SHOP segment and dispositions. 
 
 The following table compares results of operations for our 265 same-store triple-net leased properties (dollars in thousands): 
 For the Nine Months Ended September 30, Increase (Decrease) to NOI 2024 2023 Same-Store NOI Triple-Net Leased Properties: Rental income 430,717 425,279 5,438 1.3 Less: Property-level operating expenses (10,698) (9,671) (1,027) (10.6) NOI 420,019 415,608 4,411 1.1 
 
 The NOI increase in our same-store triple-net leased properties segment for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 was primarily driven by contractual rent escalators. 
 
 NOI Non-Segment 
 
 Non-segment NOI includes management fees and promote revenues, net of expenses, related to our third-party institutional capital management business, income from loans and investments and various corporate-level expenses not directly attributable to any of our three reportable business segments. The 17.7 million decrease in non-segment NOI for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 was primarily due to the conversion of the outstanding principal amount of a loan to equity in May 2023. 
 
 Company Results 
 
 Interest and other income 
 
 The 14.3 million increase in interest and other income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 was primarily due to interest income earned on cash invested in short-term money market funds. 
 
 Interest expense 
 
 The 30.4 million increase in interest expense, net of higher capitalized interest of 1.8 million, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 was primarily due to an increase of 20.5 million due to higher effective interest rates and an increase of 14.5 million due to higher debt balances. Our weighted average effective interest rate was 4.40 and 4.19 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Our weighted average debt outstanding was 13.4 billion and 13.0 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 
 44 

Depreciation and amortization 
 
 The 12.8 million decrease in depreciation and amortization expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 was primarily due to a 26.5 million decrease in impairments, an 18.7 million decrease in amortization related to intangible assets that were fully amortized in 2024 and a 16.2 million decrease in depreciation and amortization related to properties sold after September 30, 2023, partially offset by a 43.6 million increase in depreciation and amortization primarily related to properties acquired or placed into service during 2023. 
 
 General, administrative and professional fees 
 
 The 9.1 million increase in general, administrative and professional fees for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 was primarily due to lower turnover and inflationary increases. 
 
 (Loss) gain on extinguishment of debt, net 
 
 The 6.9 million decrease to gain on extinguishment of debt, net for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 was primarily due to 8.3 million of gain recognized in 2023 in connection with the repurchase of outstanding indebtedness in 2023 as a result of cash tender offers. 
 
 Transaction, transition and restructuring costs 
 
 Transaction, transition and restructuring costs include transition and integration expenses incurred by properties that have undergone operator or business model transitions; costs and expenses relating to mergers, acquisitions, investments, leases, management agreements and similar arrangements, strategic transactions, such as spin-offs, joint ventures, partnerships and minority investments, and other transactions; and costs and expenses related to organizational or other restructuring activities. The 4.6 million increase in transaction, transition and restructuring costs for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 was primarily due to costs incurred in connection with the lease amendment in the 2024 Kindred Agreements, partially offset by higher transition costs in 2023. 
 
 Recovery of allowance on loans receivable and investments, net and Gain on foreclosure of real estate 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, in connection with the Company s equitization of a mezzanine loan, the Company recognized 49 million in income composed of the derecognition and reversal of a previously recorded allowance and a gain on foreclosure of real estate. These items did not recur in 2024 resulting in 49 million less in income compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2024 (on the recovery of allowance on loans receivable and investments, net and gain on foreclosure of real estate lines). 
 
 Shareholder relations matters 
 
 Shareholder relations matters for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 relates to proxy advisory costs related to our response to a proxy campaign associated with the Company s 2024 annual meeting. There were no such costs incurred for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Other (expense) income 
 
 Other expense includes the changes in fair value of stock warrants, net expenses or recoveries related to significant disruptive events and other expenses or income. The 11.5 million change in other (expense) income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 was primarily due to a 10.9 million decrease in insurance reimbursements received in 2024, net of impairments for damages caused by significant disruptive events. 
 
 (Loss) income from unconsolidated entities 
 
 The 25.9 million increase in loss from unconsolidated entities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 is primarily due to a 1.1 million increase in net losses incurred in our equity method investees, a 33.5 million gain recognized upon the sale of approximately 24 of our 9.8 ownership interest in Ardent in May 2023, partially offset by a 8.7 million gain recognized following Ardent s initial public offering in July 2024 and the resulting decrease in our equity stake from 7.5 to approximately 6.7 . 

45 

Gain on real estate dispositions 
 
 The 28.0 million increase in gain on real estate dispositions was primarily due to a net gain of 50.3 million recognized during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 for the sale of 52 properties, partially offset by a net gain of 22.3 million in 2023 for the sale of 23 properties. 
 
 Income tax (expense) benefit 
 
 The 7.8 million of income tax expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 is primarily due to the enactment of Bill C-59 in Canada, which limits the amount of interest expense we can deduct with respect to our Canadian entities. Bill C-59 is retrospectively applied to October 1, 2023 and the cumulative effect tax of such interest limitation was recognized in the second quarter of 2024. The impact of the interest limitation was partially offset by reversal of valuation allowances recorded against the net deferred tax assets of certain of our TRS entities and losses in certain of our TRS entities. The 14.2 million of income tax benefit for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to losses in certain of our TRS entities as well as an 8.0 million benefit from internal restructurings of our U.S. TRS entities. 

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 
 We consider certain non-GAAP financial measures to be useful supplemental measures of our operating performance. A non-GAAP financial measure is a measure of historical or future financial performance, financial position or cash flows that excludes or includes amounts that are not so excluded from or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. Described below are the non-GAAP financial measures used by management to evaluate our operating performance and that we consider most useful to investors, together with reconciliations of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures. 
 
 The non-GAAP financial measures we present in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q may not be comparable to those presented by other real estate companies due to the fact that not all real estate companies use the same definitions. You should not consider these measures as alternatives for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. In order to facilitate a clear understanding of our consolidated historical operating results, you should examine these measures in conjunction with the most directly comparable GAAP measures as presented in our Consolidated Financial Statements and other financial data included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 
 Funds From Operations and Normalized Funds From Operations Attributable to Common Stockholders 
 
 Historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. However, since real estate values historically have risen or fallen with market conditions, many industry investors deem presentations of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves. For that reason, we consider Funds From Operations attributable to common stockholders FFO and Normalized FFO to be appropriate supplemental measures of operating performance of an equity REIT. We believe that the presentation of FFO, combined with the presentation of required GAAP financial measures, has improved the understanding of operating results of REITs among the investing public and has helped make comparisons of REIT operating results more meaningful. Management generally considers FFO to be a useful measure for understanding and comparing our operating results because, by excluding gains and losses related to sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets, impairment losses on depreciable real estate and real estate asset depreciation and amortization (which can differ across owners of similar assets in similar condition based on historical cost accounting and useful life estimates), FFO can help investors compare the operating performance of a company s real estate across reporting periods and to the operating performance of other companies. We believe that Normalized FFO is useful because it allows investors, analysts and our management to compare our operating performance to the operating performance of other real estate companies across periods on a consistent basis without having to account for differences caused by non-recurring items and other non-operational events such as transactions and litigation. In some cases, we provide information about identified non-cash components of FFO and Normalized FFO because it allows investors, analysts and our management to assess the impact of those items on our financial results. 
 
 We use the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts Nareit definition of FFO. Nareit defines FFO as net income attributable to common stockholders (computed in accordance with GAAP) excluding gains (or losses) from sales of real estate property, including gain (or loss) on re-measurement of equity method investments and impairment write-downs of depreciable real estate, plus real estate depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated entities and noncontrolling interests. Adjustments for unconsolidated entities and noncontrolling interests will be calculated to reflect FFO on the same basis. We define Normalized FFO as Nareit FFO excluding the following income and expense items, without duplication: (a) transaction, transition and restructuring costs; (b) amortization of other intangibles; (c) the impact of expenses 
 46 

related to asset impairment and valuation allowances; (d) the write-off of unamortized deferred financing fees or additional costs, expenses, discounts, make-whole payments, penalties or premiums incurred as a result of early retirement or payment of our debt; (e) the non-cash impact of income tax benefits or expenses; (f) the non-cash impact of changes to our executive equity compensation plan; (g) non-cash charges related to leases; (h) the financial impact of contingent consideration; (i) gains and losses on derivatives and changes in the fair value of financial instruments; (j) gains and losses on non-real estate dispositions and other normalizing items related to noncontrolling interests and unconsolidated entities; (k) net expenses or recoveries related to significant disruptive events; and (l) other items set forth in the Normalized FFO reconciliation included herein. 
 
 The following table summarizes our FFO and Normalized FFO for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (dollars in thousands). Normalized FFO for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased over the same period in 2023 due to increased net operating income from our properties led by our SHOP reportable business segment as a result of increased revenues driven by positive trends in occupancy and revenue per occupied room, partially offset by higher interest expense.

NOI 
 
 We also consider NOI an important supplemental measure because it allows investors, analysts and our management to assess our unlevered property-level operating results and to compare our operating results with those of other real estate companies and between periods on a consistent basis. We define NOI as total revenues, less interest and other income, property-level operating expenses and third party capital management expenses. 
 
 The following table sets forth a reconciliation of net income attributable to common stockholders to NOI (dollars in thousands): 
 For the Three Months Ended September 30, For the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders 19,243 (71,124) 24,318 49,846 Adjustments: Interest and other income (8,204) (2,754) (19,809) (5,529) Interest expense 150,437 147,919 449,629 419,259 Depreciation and amortization 304,268 370,377 944,371 957,185 General, administrative and professional fees 35,092 33,297 121,556 112,494 Loss (gain) on extinguishment of debt, net 612 672 (6,189) Transaction, transition and restructuring costs 8,580 7,125 16,143 11,580 Recovery of allowance on loans receivable and investments, net (56) (66) (166) (20,195) Gain on foreclosure of real estate (29,127) Shareholder relations matters 15,751 Other expense (income) 3,935 9,432 10,729 (765) Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests 1,753 1,565 5,306 4,573 (Income) loss from unconsolidated entities (4,629) 5,119 5,406 (20,512) Gain on real estate dispositions (271) (10,711) (50,282) (22,317) Income tax expense (benefit) 3,002 (1,662) 7,764 (14,237) NOI 513,150 489,129 1,531,388 1,436,066 
 
 See Results of Operations for discussions regarding both NOI and same-store NOI. We define same-store as properties owned, consolidated and operational for the full period in both comparison periods and that are not otherwise excluded; provided, however, that we may include selected properties that otherwise meet the same-store criteria if they are included in substantially all of, but not a full, period for one or both of the comparison periods, and in our judgment such inclusion provides a more meaningful presentation of our segment performance. 
 
 Newly acquired development properties and recently developed or redeveloped properties in our SHOP reportable business segment will be included in same-store once they are stabilized for the full period in both periods presented. These properties are considered stabilized upon the earlier of (a) the achievement of 80 sustained occupancy or (b) 24 months from the date of acquisition or substantial completion of work. Recently developed or redeveloped properties in our outpatient medical and research portfolio and triple-net leased properties reportable business segments will be included in same-store once substantial completion of work has occurred for the full period in both periods presented. Our senior housing operating portfolio and triple-net leased properties that have undergone operator or business model transitions will be included in same-store once operating under consistent operating structures for the full period in both periods presented. 
 
 Properties are excluded from same-store if they are: (i) sold, classified as held for sale or properties whose operations were classified as discontinued operations in accordance with GAAP; (ii) impacted by significant disruptive events such as flood or fire; (iii) for SHOP, those properties that are currently undergoing a significant disruptive redevelopment; (iv) for our outpatient medical and research portfolio and triple-net leased properties reportable business segments, those properties for which management has an intention to institute, or has instituted, a redevelopment plan because the properties may require major property-level expenditures to maximize value, increase NOI, or maintain a market-competitive position and/or achieve property stabilization, most commonly as the result of an expected or actual material change in occupancy or NOI; or (v) for 
 48 

SHOP and triple-net leased properties reportable business segments, those properties that are scheduled to undergo operator or business model transitions, or have transitioned operators or business models after the start of the prior comparison period. 
 
 To eliminate the impact of exchange rate movements, certain of our performance-based disclosures, including same-store NOI for SHOP and NNN, assume constant exchange rates across comparable periods, using the following methodology: the current period s results are shown in actual reported USD, while prior comparison period s results are adjusted and converted to USD based on the average exchange rate for the current period. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 Our principal sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations, proceeds from the issuance of debt and equity securities, borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facility and commercial paper program, and proceeds from asset sales. 
 
 For the next 12 months, our principal liquidity needs are to: (i) fund operating expenses; (ii) meet our debt service requirements; (iii) repay maturing mortgage and other debt; (iv) fund acquisitions, investments and commitments and any development and redevelopment activities; (v) fund capital expenditures; and (vi) make distributions to our stockholders and unitholders, as required for us to continue to qualify as a REIT. Depending upon the availability of external capital, we believe our liquidity is sufficient to fund these uses of cash. We expect that these liquidity needs generally will be satisfied by a combination of the following: cash flows from operations, cash on hand, debt assumptions and financings (including secured financings), issuances of debt and equity securities, dispositions of assets (including, in whole or in part, through joint venture arrangements with third parties) and borrowings under our revolving credit facilities and commercial paper program. However, an inability to access liquidity through multiple capital sources concurrently could have a material adverse effect on us. 
 
 Our material contractual obligations arising in the normal course of business primarily consist of long-term debt and related interest payments, and operating obligations which include ground lease obligations. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our material contractual obligations increased primarily due to net issuances of senior notes in 2024. See Note 10 Senior Notes Payable and Other Debt of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further information regarding our long-term debt obligations and operating obligations, respectively. 
 
 We may, from time to time, seek to retire or purchase our outstanding indebtedness for cash or in exchange for equity securities in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Such repurchases or exchanges, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions, prospects for capital and other factors. The amounts involved may be material. 
 
 Credit Facilities, Commercial Paper, Unsecured Term Loans and Letters of Credit 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we have a 2.75 billion unsecured revolving credit facility priced at SOFR plus 0.10 Adjusted SOFR plus 0.775 which is subject to adjustment based on the Company s debt ratings. Our unsecured revolving credit facility matures in April 2028, and may be extended at our option, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, for two additional periods of six months each. The revolving credit facility also includes an accordion feature that permits us to increase our aggregate borrowing capacity thereunder to up to 3.75 billion, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, including the receipt of additional commitments for such increase. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 2.7 billion of undrawn capacity under our unsecured revolving credit facility with 7.9 million outstanding and an additional 0.8 million restricted to support outstanding letters of credit. We use our unsecured revolving credit facility to support our commercial paper program and for general corporate purposes. 
 
 Our wholly-owned subsidiary, Ventas Realty, Limited Partnership Ventas Realty ), may issue from time to time unsecured commercial paper notes up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of 1.0 billion. The notes are sold under customary terms in the U.S. commercial paper note market and are ranked pari passu with all of Ventas Realty s other unsecured senior indebtedness. The notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Ventas, Inc. As of September 30, 2024, we had no borrowings outstanding under our commercial paper program. 
 
 49 

Ventas Realty has a 500.0 million unsecured term loan priced at Adjusted SOFR plus 0.85 , which is subject to adjustment based on Ventas Realty s debt ratings. This term loan is fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Ventas, Inc. It matures in June 2027 and includes an accordion feature that permits Ventas Realty to increase the aggregate borrowings thereunder to up to 1.25 billion, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, including the receipt of additional commitments for such increase. 
 
 Ventas Realty has a 200.0 million unsecured term loan priced at Adjusted SOFR plus 0.85 , which is subject to adjustment based on Ventas Realty s debt ratings. This term loan is fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Ventas, Inc. It matures in February 2027 and includes an accordion feature that permits Ventas Realty to increase the aggregate borrowings thereunder to up to 500.0 million, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, including the receipt of additional commitments for such increase. 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we repaid a C 500.0 million 369.4 million) unsecured term loan facility priced at Canadian Dollar Offered Rate CDOR plus 0.90 that would otherwise have matured in January 2025. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, our 100.0 million uncommitted line for standby letters of credit had an outstanding balance of 15.4 million. The agreement governing the line contains certain customary covenants and, under its terms, we are required to pay a commission on each outstanding letter of credit at a fixed rate. 
 
 Exchangeable Senior Notes 
 
 In June 2023, Ventas Realty issued 862.5 million aggregate principal amount of its 3.75 Exchangeable Senior Notes due 2026 (the Exchangeable Notes in a private placement. The Exchangeable Notes are senior, unsecured obligations of Ventas Realty and are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on an unsecured and unsubordinated basis by Ventas, Inc. The Exchangeable Notes bear interest at a rate of 3.75 per year, payable semi-annually in arrears on June 1 and December 1 of each year, beginning on December 1, 2023. The Exchangeable Notes mature on June 1, 2026, unless earlier exchanged, redeemed or repurchased. As of September 30, 2024, we had 862.5 million aggregate principal amount of the Exchangeable Notes outstanding. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized approximately 8.1 million and 24.3 million respectively, of contractual interest expense and amortization of issuance costs of 1.7 million and 5.1 million, respectively, related to the Exchangeable Notes. Unamortized issuance costs of 12.0 million as of September 30, 2024 were recorded as an offset to senior notes payable and other debt on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. 
 
 The Exchangeable Notes are exchangeable at an initial exchange rate of 18.2460 shares of our common stock per 1,000 principal amount of Exchangeable Notes (equivalent to an initial exchange price of approximately 54.81 per share of common stock). The initial exchange rate is subject to adjustment, including in the event of the payment of a quarterly dividend in excess of 0.45 per share, but will not be adjusted for any accrued and unpaid interest. Upon exchange of the Exchangeable Notes, Ventas Realty will pay cash up to the aggregate principal amount of the Exchangeable Notes to be exchanged and pay or deliver (or cause to be delivered), as the case may be, cash, shares of common stock or a combination of cash and shares of common stock, at Ventas Realty s election, in respect of the remainder, if any, of its exchange obligation in excess of the aggregate principal amount of the Exchangeable Notes being exchanged. Prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding March 1, 2026, the Exchangeable Notes will be exchangeable at the option of the noteholders only upon the satisfaction of specified conditions and during certain periods described in the indenture governing the Exchangeable Notes. On or after March 1, 2026, until the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the maturity date, the Exchangeable Notes will be exchangeable at the option of the noteholders at any time regardless of these conditions or periods. 
 
 Senior Notes 
 
 In February 2024, Ventas Canada Finance Limited Ventas Canada issued and sold C 650.0 million 478.3 million) aggregate principal amount of 5.10 Senior Notes, Series J due 2029 in a private placement. The proceeds were primarily used to repay a C 500.0 million 369.4 million) unsecured term loan facility due 2025.

 In September 2024, we repaid C 163.3 million 120.8 million) aggregate principal amount of 4.125 Senior Notes due 2024 at maturity with cash on hand. 
 
 Mortgages

 In April 2024, we entered into an aggregate C 103.0 million 75.5 million) fixed rate mortgage loans, which accrue interest at a blended rate of 4.90 , mature in 2029 and are secured by two senior housing communities in Canada. 
 
 In May 2024, we entered into a 52.3 million fixed rate mortgage loan, which accrues interest at 6.02 , matures in 2034 and is secured by one outpatient medical building in California. 
 
 Equity Offerings 
 
 In September 2024, we entered into an at-the-market equity offering program 2024 ATM Program ), which provides for the sale, from time to time, of up to 2.0 billion aggregate gross sales price of shares of our common stock. In connection with our entry into the 2024 ATM Program, we terminated our prior at-the-market equity offering program (together with the 2024 ATM Program, the ATM Programs under the ATM Sales Agreement dated November 8, 2021 and amended February 20, 2024, pursuant to which we previously, from time to time, could sell up to 1.0 billion aggregate gross sales price of shares of our common stock. The ATM Programs have allowed us to enter into forward sales agreements, discussed below. By utilizing a forward sales agreement, we can secure a share price on the sale of shares of our common stock at or shortly after the time the forward sales agreement becomes effective, while postponing the receipt of proceeds from the sale of shares until a future date. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, the remaining amount available under our 2024 ATM Program for future sales of our common stock was 1.9 billion. 
 
 ATM Share Issuances 
 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we issued 5.9 million shares of our common stock under our ATM Programs for gross proceeds of 362.6 million, representing an average price of 61.22 per share, of which 4.5 million shares and 282.0 million of gross proceeds were issued and settled via forward sales agreements. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we issued 16.4 million shares of our common stock under our ATM Programs for gross proceeds of 862.0 million, representing an average price of 52.70 per share, of which 4.5 million shares and 282.0 million of gross proceeds were issued and settled via forward sales agreements. 
 
 Forward Sales Agreements 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we have unsettled forward sales agreements for 2.6 million shares or approximately 158.6 million in gross proceeds with varying maturity dates through December 2025. 
 
 In October 2024, we entered into additional unsettled forward sales agreements for 0.8 million shares or approximately 51.0 million in gross proceeds with varying maturity dates through December 2025. 
 
 Derivatives and Hedging 
 
 In the normal course of our business, interest rate fluctuations affect future cash flows under our variable rate debt obligations, loans receivable and marketable debt securities, and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations affect our 
 51 

operating results. We follow established risk management policies and procedures, including the use of derivative instruments, to mitigate the impact of these risks. 
 
 We do not use derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes, and we have a policy of entering into contracts only with major financial institutions based upon their credit ratings and other factors. When considered together with the underlying exposure that the derivative is designed to hedge, we do not expect that the use of derivatives in this manner would have any material adverse effect on our future financial condition or results of operations. 
 
 Periodically, we enter into and designate interest rate locks to partially hedge the risk of changes in interest payments attributable to increases in the benchmark interest rate during the period leading up to the probable issuance of fixed-rate debt. We designate our interest rate locks as cash flow hedges. Gains and losses when we settle our interest rate locks are amortized over the life of the related debt and recorded in interest expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, our variable rate debt obligations of 0.8 billion reflect, in part, the effect of 142.3 million notional amount of interest rate swaps with maturities in March 2027, that effectively convert fixed rate debt to variable rate debt. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, our fixed rate debt obligations of 13.0 billion reflect, in part, the effect of 526.7 million and C 639.8 million notional amount of interest rate swaps with maturities ranging from February 2025 to April 2031 in each case, that effectively convert variable rate debt to fixed rate debt. 
 
 2024 Activity 
 
 From June through September 2024, we entered into an aggregate 350.0 million treasury locks to hedge interest rate risk on future debt issuances. In September 2024, we terminated the treasury locks in conjunction with the issuance of the 550.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.00 Senior Notes due 2035. 
 
 Dividends 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we declared a dividend of 0.45 per share of our common stock in each of the first, second and third quarter. In order to continue to qualify as a REIT, we must make annual distributions to our stockholders of at least 90 of our REIT taxable income (excluding net capital gain). In addition, we will be subject to income tax at the regular corporate rate to the extent we distribute less than 100 of our REIT taxable income, including any net capital gains. We intend to pay dividends greater than 100 of our taxable income, after the use of any net operating loss carryforwards, for 2024. 
 
 We expect that our cash flows will exceed our REIT taxable income due to depreciation and other non-cash deductions in computing REIT taxable income and that we will be able to satisfy the 90 distribution requirement. However, from time to time, we may not have sufficient cash on hand or other liquid assets to meet this requirement or we may decide to retain cash or distribute such greater amount as may be necessary to avoid income and excise taxation. If we do not have sufficient cash on hand or other liquid assets to enable us to satisfy the 90 distribution requirement, or if we desire to retain cash, we may borrow funds, issue additional equity securities, pay taxable stock dividends, if possible, distribute other property or securities or engage in a transaction intended to enable us to meet the REIT distribution requirements or any combination of the foregoing.

Cash Flows 
 
 The following table sets forth our sources and uses of cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (dollars in thousands): 
 For the Nine Months Ended September 30, Increase (Decrease) to Cash 
 2024 2023 Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash at beginning of period 563,462 170,745 392,717 nm Net cash provided by operating activities 955,984 840,789 115,195 13.7 Net cash used in investing activities (840,875) (141,388) (699,487) nm Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities 489,019 (378,294) 867,313 nm Effect of foreign currency translation (1,893) (106) (1,787) nm Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash at end of period 1,165,697 491,746 673,951 137.1 
 ______________________________ 
 nm - not meaningful 
 
 Cash Flows from Operating Activities 
 
 Cash flows from operating activities increased 115.2 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 primarily due to higher property NOI in 2024, partially offset by higher interest expense and costs related to shareholder relations matters in 2024. 
 
 Cash Flows from Investing Activities 
 
 Net cash used in investing activities increased 699.5 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 primarily due to higher acquisition volume and investment in loans receivable in 2024. 
 
 Cash Flows from Financing Activities 
 
 Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities changed 867.3 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 primarily due to higher issuances of common stock. 
 
 Capital Expenditures 
 
 The terms of our triple-net leases generally obligate our tenants to pay all capital expenditures necessary to maintain and improve our triple-net leased properties. However, from time to time, we may fund the capital expenditures for our triple-net leased properties through loans or advances to the tenants, which may increase the amount of rent payable with respect to the properties in certain cases. We may also fund capital expenditures for which we may become responsible upon expiration of our triple-net leases or in the event that our tenants are unable or unwilling to meet their obligations under those leases. We also expect to fund capital expenditures related to our SHOP and outpatient medical and research portfolio segments with the cash flows from the properties or through additional borrowings. We expect that these liquidity needs generally will be satisfied by a combination of the following: cash flows from operations, cash on hand, debt assumptions and financings (including secured financings), issuances of debt and equity securities, dispositions of assets (in whole or in part through joint venture arrangements with third parties) and borrowings under our revolving credit facilities and commercial paper program. 
 
 To the extent that unanticipated capital expenditure needs arise or significant borrowings are required, our liquidity may be affected adversely. Our ability to borrow additional funds may be restricted in certain circumstances by the terms of the instruments governing our outstanding indebtedness. 
 
 We are party to certain agreements that obligate us to develop senior housing communities, outpatient medical buildings or research centers funded through capital that we and, in certain circumstances, our joint venture partners provide. As of September 30, 2024, we had four active and committed projects pursuant to these agreements, including three projects that are unconsolidated. 
 
 53 

In addition, from time to time, we engage in redevelopment projects with respect to our existing senior housing communities, outpatient medical buildings and research centers to maximize the value, increase NOI, maintain a market-competitive position, achieve property stabilization or change the primary use of the property. 
 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 
 We own interests in certain unconsolidated entities as described in Note 7 Investments in Unconsolidated Entities. Except in limited circumstances, our risk of loss is limited to our investment in the joint venture and any outstanding loans receivable. In addition, we have certain properties which serve as collateral for debt that is owed by a previous owner of certain of our facilities, as described under Note 10 Senior Notes Payable and Other Debt to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Our risk of loss for these certain properties is limited to the outstanding debt balance plus penalties, if any. Further, we use financial derivative instruments to hedge interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate exposure. Finally, as of September 30, 2024, we had 16.3 million outstanding letters of credit obligations. We have no other material off-balance sheet arrangements that we expect would materially affect our liquidity and capital resources except those described above.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 
 The following discussion of our exposure to various market risks contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. These projected results have been prepared utilizing certain assumptions considered reasonable in light of information currently available to us. Nevertheless, because of the inherent unpredictability of interest rates and other factors, actual results could differ materially from those projected in such forward-looking information. 
 
 We are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates with respect to borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facility, commercial paper program and our unsecured term loans, certain of our mortgage loans that are floating rate obligations, mortgage loans receivable that bear interest at floating rates and available for sale securities. These market risks result primarily from changes in benchmark interest rates. To manage these risks, we continuously monitor our level of variable rate debt with respect to total debt and other factors, including our assessment of current and future economic conditions. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the fair value of our secured and non-mortgage loans receivable, based on our estimates of current prevailing rates for comparable loans, was 168.8 million and 53.1 million, respectively. 
 
 The fair value of our fixed rate debt is based on current market interest rates at which we could obtain similar borrowings. Increases in market interest rates typically result in a decrease in the fair value of fixed rate debt while decreases in market interest rates typically result in an increase in the fair value of fixed rate debt. While changes in market interest rates affect the fair value of our fixed rate debt, these changes do not affect the interest expense associated with our fixed rate debt. Therefore, interest rate risk does not have a significant impact on our fixed rate debt obligations until their maturity or earlier prepayment and refinancing. If interest rates have risen at the time we seek to refinance our fixed rate debt, whether at maturity or otherwise, our future earnings and cash flows could be adversely affected by additional borrowing costs. Conversely, lower interest rates at the time of refinancing may reduce our overall borrowing costs. 
 
 To highlight the sensitivity of our fixed rate debt to changes in interest rates, the following summary shows the effects of a hypothetical instantaneous change of 100 basis points in interest rates (dollars in thousands): 
 As of September 30, 2024 As of December 31, 2023 Gross book value 12,984,274 12,458,828 Fair value 13,066,288 11,994,321 Fair value reflecting change in interest rates: -100 basis points 13,567,878 12,457,648 +100 basis points 12,553,108 11,568,461

The table below sets forth certain information with respect to our debt, excluding premiums and discounts (dollars in thousands): 
 As of September 30, 2024 As of December 31, 2023 As of September 30, 2023 Balance: Fixed rate: Senior notes/Exchangeable senior notes 9,833,651 9,302,840 9,273,091 Unsecured term loans 400,000 400,000 400,000 Mortgage loans and other 2,750,623 2,755,988 2,710,912 Subtotal fixed rate 12,984,274 12,458,828 12,384,003 Variable rate: Unsecured revolving credit facility 7,922 14,006 31,677 Unsecured term loans 300,000 677,501 668,270 Commercial paper notes Mortgage loans and other 479,824 418,263 395,412 Subtotal variable rate 787,746 1,109,770 1,095,359 Total 13,772,020 13,568,598 13,479,362 Percentage of total debt: Fixed rate: Senior notes/Exchangeable senior notes 71.4 68.6 68.8 Unsecured term loans 2.9 2.9 3.0 Mortgage loans and other 20.0 20.3 20.1 Variable rate: Unsecured revolving credit facility 0.1 0.1 0.2 Unsecured term loans 2.2 5.0 5.0 Commercial paper notes Mortgage loans and other 3.4 3.1 2.9 Total 100.0 100.0 100.0 Weighted average interest rate at end of period: Fixed rate: Senior notes/Exchangeable senior notes 4.1 3.8 3.8 Unsecured term loans 4.7 4.7 4.7 Mortgage loans and other 4.3 4.2 4.2 Variable rate: Unsecured revolving credit facility 5.5 6.1 6.1 Unsecured term loans 6.0 6.3 6.3 Commercial paper notes Mortgage loans and other 5.7 6.1 6.0 Total 4.2 4.1 4.1 
 
 The variable rate debt as of September 30, 2024 in the table above reflects, in part, the effect of 142.3 million notional amount of interest rate swaps with maturities on March 2027, that effectively convert fixed rate debt to variable rate debt. In addition, the fixed rate debt as of September 30, 2024 in the table above reflects, in part, the effect of 526.7 million and C 639.8 million notional amount of interest rate swaps with maturities ranging from February 2025 to April 2031, in each case, that effectively convert variable rate debt to fixed rate debt. 
 
 The decrease in our outstanding variable rate debt at September 30, 2024 compared to December 31, 2023 is primarily attributable to the repayment of C 500.0 million 369.4 million) unsecured term loan. 
 
 The increase in our outstanding fixed rate debt at September 30, 2024 compared to December 31, 2023 was primarily attributable to the issuance of our 550.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.00 Senior Notes due 2035. 
 
 57 

Assuming a 100 basis point increase in the weighted average interest rate related to our consolidated variable rate debt and assuming no change in our consolidated variable rate debt outstanding as of September 30, 2024 of 787.7 million, interest expense on an annualized basis would increase by approximately 7.9 million, or less than 0.02 per diluted common share. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, our joint venture partners aggregate share of total consolidated debt was 311.7 million and 297.5 million, respectively, with respect to certain properties we owned through consolidated joint ventures. 
 
 Total consolidated debt does not include our portion of unconsolidated debt related to investments in unconsolidated real estate entities, which was 650.2 million and 575.3 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 
 As a result of our Canadian and United Kingdom operations, we are subject to fluctuations in certain foreign currency exchange rates that may, from time to time, affect our financial condition and operating performance. Based solely on our results for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 (including the impact of existing hedging arrangements), if the value of the U.S. dollar relative to the British pound and Canadian dollar were to increase or decrease by one standard deviation compared to the average exchange rate during the year, our Net Income and Normalized FFO for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 would decrease or increase by less than 0.01 per diluted common share. We will continue to mitigate these risks through a layered approach to hedging looking out for the next year and continual assessment of our foreign operational capital structure. Nevertheless, we cannot assure you that any such fluctuations will not have an effect on our earnings.
