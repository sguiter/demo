 NOTES
TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

 (UNAUDITED) 

at June 30, 2024. Accordingly, it requires
capital to fund working capital deficits and for future operating activities to take place. The Company s ability to raise new
funds through the future issuances of debt or common stock is unknown. The obtainment of additional financing, the successful development
of a plan of operations, and its transition, ultimately, to the attainment of profitable operations are necessary for the Company to
continue operations. The ability of the Company to continue its operations is dependent on management s plans, which include the
raising of capital through debt and/or equity markets, with some additional funding from other traditional financing sources, including
term notes, until such time that funds provided by operations are sufficient to fund working capital requirements. The Company may need
to incur additional liabilities with certain related parties to sustain the Company s existence. There can be no assurance that
the Company will be able to raise any additional capital and therefore raise doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a
going concern. 

Future
issuances of the Company s equity or debt securities will be required for the Company to finance operations and continue as a going
concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that may result from the outcome of these uncertainties.

ITEM
2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND PLAN OF OPERATION 

The
following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements
and the related notes, and other financial information included in this Form 10-Q. 

Our
Management s Discussion and Analysis contains not only statements that are historical facts, but also statements that are forward-looking.
Forward-looking statements are, by their very nature, uncertain and risky. Although the forward-looking statements in this Quarterly
Report reflect the good faith judgment of our management, such statements can only be based on facts and factors currently known by them.
Consequently, and because forward-looking statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties, the actual results and outcomes
may differ materially from the results and outcomes discussed in the forward-looking statements. You are urged to carefully review and
consider the various disclosures made by us in this report as we attempt to advise interested parties of the risks and factors that may
affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations and prospects. 

FORWARD
LOOKING STATEMENTS 

The
information contained in this Form 10-Q contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities
Act of 1933, as amended, Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the Private Securities Litigation Reform
Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, including among other things, statements regarding our
capital needs, business strategy and expectations. Any statement which does not contain a historical fact may be deemed to be a forward-looking
statement. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as may , will , should ,
 expect , plan , intend , anticipate , believe , estimate ,
 predict , potential or continue , the negative of such terms or other comparable terminology.
In evaluating forward looking statements, you should consider various factors outlined in our Form 10-K report for the year ended September
30, 2023, filed with the U.S. Securities Exchange Commission SEC and, from time to time, in other reports we file with
the SEC. These factors may cause our actual results to differ materially from any forward-looking statement. We disclaim any obligation
to publicly update these statements or disclose any difference between our actual results and those reflected in these statements. 

Overview 

The
core business of GSTX is manufacturing the materials and technologies for a greener more sustainable future. In line with the UN Sustainable
Development Goals (https://sdgs.un.org/goals), the company is focused on two key sectors, energy and water. GSTX has established/acquired
a portfolio of businesses specializing in using advanced manufacturing to make advanced materials for energy and water production. With
a strong ESG focus the company is committed to establishing local manufacturing of tangible products for local markets. 

In
the energy space, the company is leveraging its existing business and management s core competency to reshore solar manufacturing.
The initial target markets are USA and Australia but exploring opportunities in Southeast Asia and Europe. A made locally approach. 

The
solar market is growing strongly (>10 annual growth). In addition to its strong environmental credentials, solar is now the cheapest
form of electricity generation. The fundamental economics of solar are driving this market growth. With the market adoption, and price
reductions, of short-term battery storage, many solar and battery installations are completely independent of grid-based distribution.
Solar is a mature, proven technology. 

 During
Q1 in the USA alone a record 11GW of solar was installed. This accounted for 75 of new energy installations in America. Currently in
the US alone there are approximately 15GW of solar cell and panel manufacturing factories under construction. There are an additional
approximate 15GW of factories in planning. The solar market in the USA at present is very strong. A solar panel is made up of multiple
solar cells made from silicon wafers. At present 99 of all silicon wafers are made in China. US-based silicon wafer production and the
majority of cell and panel production ceased over a decade ago. As a result, China completely dominates solar manufacturing. All but
one of the new American based factories are relying on Chinese produced wafers for their production. GSTX plans to be the first company
in production of American made silicon wafers during Q3/Q4 2025. 

11 

Silicon
Wafer Manufacturing 

The
solar supply chain can be depicted as follows: 

Quartz
-> silicon -> polysilicon -> silicon ingots -> silicon wafers -> solar cells -> solar modules (panels) 

GSTX
has established a new, wholly owned, subsidiary, The Quartz Silicon Materials Company Ltd QSM to hold its businesses
involved in the solar manufacturing sector. QSM is the parent company for: 

Ausquartz
 Group Holdings (AUSQUARTZ) An Australian based company with world class expertise
 in high purity quartz. Ausquartz operates a test and pilot production facility in Melbourne
 Australia. The company is successfully producing solar and semiconductor grade quartz sand. 

Wafer
 Manufacturing Company (WMC) A USA based company developing silicon wafer manufacturing
 operations for supplying downstream solar cell manufacturers. WMC is a joint venture with
 American Solar Manufacturing Corporation. 

Southern
 Silicon A New Zealand based company developing a silicon metal smelter and a polysilicon
 production plant on the South Island of New Zealand. These two facilities will utilise local
 resources and green (renewable) power. 

These
three key businesses provide an integrated supply chain for the production and delivery of silicon wafers. QSM is structured to take
advantage of the American Inflation Reduction Act and the Australian Made in Australia programs to reshore
critical solar manufacturing. Producing wafers locally (Made in America/Made in Australia) is key to being able to claim government incentives
(production credits). QSM is a low technology risk enterprise, no new inventions, just manufacturing. 

Water
Harvesting 

Water
scarcity is at the center of the world s most significant challenges. The United Nations estimates approximately 30 of the world s
population will face severe water shortages by 2025. Many people do not realise that the atmosphere, the air we breathe, contains a significant
amount of water. Humidity is water in the air. Air can hold 1-2 ounces of water per cubic yard. At any one instant, the Earth s
atmosphere contains 37.5 trillion gallons of water vapor enough to cover the entire surface of the planet with 1.5 inches of
rain if condensed. 

In
parallel, massive population growth and urbanisation has led to an unprecedented demand for fresh water. Investment in infrastructure
has been woefully inadequate, resulting in severe and critical water stress globally. There are an estimated 13 trillion litres (3.4
trillion gal) of water floating in the atmosphere at any one time. There is 6 times as much fresh water in the air as in all rivers and
lakes in the world. 

The
Company is continuing commercialization of a unique water harvesting technology utilizing modular, self-contained units that can be solar
or grid powered, and deployed in urban and rural environments. The water harvesters will extract moisture from the ambient air and collect
as 100 pure fresh water. Each domestic water harvester will be capable of generating 30-50 liters (8-13 gal) of pure fresh water per
day for personal use, with commercial models collecting up to 50,000 liters (13,000 gal) per day. The 100 pure H20 extracted from the
atmosphere is also suitable for industrial use in green hydrogen production and pharmaceutical, semiconductor processing plants. 

A
100 operational subsidiary has been established for the water harvesting products. It will trade as Adaquo, which is a Latin verb meaning
to supply water. The company has engaged the services of two industry veterans (20+ years experience) to assist with commercialization
of the technology. 

Whilst
still undertaking in house development of the company s proprietary solid-state technology, the company is also exploring opportunities
to license and distribute existing products that have been market proven on an exclusive geographical basis.

Graphene
Material 

The
company has a strong interest in the downstream, commercial, applications of graphene. Unfortunately, the graphene sector has struggled
to achieve significant commercial adoption of its materials. In addition, the scalable, bulk, production of graphene is also yet to be
achieved at commercially economic levels. Graphene continues to show early stage promising technological improvements, but larger scale
business opportunities remain elusive. GSTX management remain active in the sector and believe that graphene has a commercial future,
but at present GSTX has paused actively developing its graphene opportunities. Graphene remains an interest of the company and continues
to monitor the sector. The company remains interested in bulk production of graphene for the additive markets. 

US
Thin Films 

GSTX
has recently restructured its shareholding in US Thin-Film Corporation. GSTX is now a minority shareholder (19 of US Thin-Film Corporation. 

Applications
of the proprietary thin film in existing electronics applications outperforms current materials. Key applications include: Electromagnetic
Interference (EMI) Shielding, Flexible Transparent Antennas (4G/5G communications), Transparent Heaters (windows, goggles, etc), Touch
Displays (monitors, phones, tablets), Photovoltaic, OLED Lighting, Flexible Displays, Sensors, and numerous other electronic applications
The US Thin-Film technology is superior to traditional/existing technology with multiple times the electrical conductivity of conventional
ITO based transparent conductive films with a simple manufacturing method protected by the company s patent portfolio. 

The
company is presently in discussions with several contract manufacturing groups to produce initial samples of its thin film technology,
branded Dragonfly film, for product qualification and pre-sales activity purposes. 

Other
areas of interest 

The
Company is also exploring acquisition opportunities for Critical Resource Assets (Minerals with identified supply chain risk), rare earth
mineral extraction, zero emission fossil fuel replacement, green hydrogen, and ammonia production.

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

An
evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Principal Executive and
Interim Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this
report on Form 10-Q. Disclosure controls and procedures are procedures designed with the objective of ensuring that information required
to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, such as this Form 10-Q, is recorded, processed, summarized
and reported, within the time period specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms, and that such information
is accumulated and is communicated to our management, including our Principal Executive [and Financial Officer], or persons performing
similar functions, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on that evaluation, our management
concluded that, as of December 31, 2020, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective. 

Management
conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on the framework
established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in
2013 COSO ). 

As
of period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we have concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was ineffective.
The Company s assessment identified certain material weaknesses which are set forth below: 

Functional
Controls and Segregation of Duties 

Because
of the Company s limited resources, there are limited controls over information processing. 

There
is an inadequate segregation of duties consistent with control objectives. Our Company s management is composed of a small number
of individuals resulting in a situation where limitations on segregation of duties exist. In order to remedy this situation, we would
need to hire additional staff to provide greater segregation of duties. Currently, it is not feasible to hire additional staff to obtain
optimal segregation of duties. Management will reassess this matter in the following year to determine whether improvement in segregation
of duty is feasible. 

Accordingly,
as the result of identifying the above material weakness we have concluded that these control deficiencies resulted in a reasonable possibility
that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by the
Company s internal controls. 

Management s
Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting and for the assessment
of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. As defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission, internal control
over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of our Principal Executive and Financial Officer and implemented
by our Board of Directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of our financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 

15 

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of
any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,
or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

Roger
May, our former Principal Executive Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December
31, 2020 based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations
of the Treadway Commission, or the COSO Framework (2013). Management s assessment included an evaluation of the design of our internal
control over financial reporting and testing of the operational effectiveness of those controls. 

Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

There
was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the period covered by this report that has materially
affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

Management
has addressed the underlying causes for our weaknesses in internal control since early FY 2020. Our efforts to raise both debt and equity
capital soon will allow us to undertake additional engagement of external independent consultants to assist with the processing
of data and drafting financial reports on a timely basis in future reporting periods.
