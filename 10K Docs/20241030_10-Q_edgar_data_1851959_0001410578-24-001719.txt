If the Company is unable to complete the initial Business Combination within such period or during any additional Extension Period (as defined below), the Company will: (1) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up; (2) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account (which interest shall be net of taxes payable (excluding excise taxes), and less up to of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any), (3) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of the Company s remaining stockholders and the board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to the Company s obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to their warrants, which will expire worthless if the Company fails to complete the initial Business Combination within the Combination Period. The Sponsors, officers and directors have agreed to waive: (1) their redemption rights with respect to any Founder Shares and public shares held by them, as applicable, in connection with the completion of the initial Business Combination; (2) their redemption rights with respect to any Founder Shares and public shares held by them in connection with a stockholder vote to approve an amendment to the Company s amended and restated certificate of incorporation (A) to modify the substance or timing of the obligation to allow redemptions in connection with the initial Business Combination or to redeem of the public shares if the Company has not consummated the initial Business Combination within the Combination Period or (B) with respect to any other provision relating to stockholders rights or pre-initial Business Combination activity; and (3) their rights to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to any Founder Shares they hold if the Company fails to complete the initial Business Combination within the Combination Period or during any extended time that the Company has to consummate a Business Combination beyond the Combination Period as a result of a stockholder vote to amend the Company s amended and restated certificate of incorporation (an Extension Period (although they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to any public shares they hold if the Company fails to complete the initial Business Combination within the Combination Period).

Moreover, in the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, the Sponsors will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third-party claims. The Company has not independently verified whether the Sponsor has sufficient funds to satisfy its indemnity obligations and believe that the Sponsor s only assets are securities of the Company and, therefore, the Sponsor may not be able to satisfy those obligations. The Company has not asked the Sponsor to reserve for such obligations. Liquidity and Going Concern Considerations As of September 30, 2024, the Company had cash of held outside of the Trust Account and available for working capital purposes. Further, investment income on the funds held in the Trust Account may be released to the Company to pay taxes (excluding excise taxes) and up to to pay dissolution expenses. Additionally, the Company has incurred an excise tax liability of , of which approximately is payable in October 2024. The Company currently has insufficient funds to pay this liability, absent any additional financing. On March 28, 2024, the Company entered into a subscription agreement (the March Subscription Agreement with the Sponsor and the Capital Contribution Note Investor (see Note 6), pursuant to which the Capital Contribution Note Investor has agreed to provide up to to the Sponsor and, subsequently, the Sponsor would loan the funds to the Company (the Capital Contribution Note through a Promissory Note as discussed in Note 3 and Note 6. As of September 30, 2024, the Company called under the Capital Contribution Note (see Note 6) and subsequently borrowed under a Promissory Note (see Note 3). On May 31, 2024, the Company issued an unsecured promissory note (the Note in the principal amount of up to to the Sponsor, a significant stockholder of the Company, which may be drawn down from time to time prior to the Maturity Date (defined below) upon request by the Company. The Note amended, replaced and superseded in its entirety that certain promissory note, dated May 3, 2022, made by the Company in favor of the Sponsor in the principal amount of up to (the Original Note ), and any unpaid principal balance of the indebtedness evidenced by the Original Note has been merged into and evidenced by the Note. The Note does not bear interest and the principal balance will be payable on the date on which the Company consummates its initial Business Combination (such date, the Maturity Date ). The Note is subject to customary events of default, the occurrence of certain of which automatically triggers the unpaid principal balance of the Note and all other sums payable with regard to the Note becoming immediately due and payable. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there was amount outstanding under the Note. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement with Events.com, the Merger Agreement provides for the parties to cooperate, between the date of the Merger Agreement and the Closing, to raise capital for Events.com through the sale of equity securities, or securities convertible into equity securities (the Interim Financing ). In association with the Merger Agreement, Events.com will be required to pay to the Company an amount based on funds raised by Events.com (see Note 2). If the estimate of the costs of identifying a target business, undertaking in-depth due diligence and negotiating a Business Combination are less than the actual amount necessary to do so, the Company may have insufficient funds available to operate our business prior to completing a Business Combination. Moreover, the Company may need to obtain additional financing either to complete a Business Combination or because the Company becomes obligated to redeem a significant number of additional public shares upon consummation of a Business Combination, in which case the Company may issue additional securities or incur debt in connection with such Business Combination. Subject to compliance with applicable securities laws, the Company would only complete such financing simultaneously with the completion of a Business Combination. In addition, following a Business Combination, if cash on hand is insufficient, the Company may need to obtain additional financing in order to meet its obligations.

Such guidance provides that because the warrants do not meet the criteria for equity treatment thereunder, each warrant must be classified as a liability. Accordingly, the Company classifies each warrant as a liability at its fair value. This liability is subject to re-measurement at each balance sheet date. With each such re-measurement, the warrant liability will be adjusted to fair value, with the change in fair value recognized in the Company s condensed consolidated statements of operations. consideration, a number of shares of Class B common stock, par value per share, of the Company equal to the number of 2023 Promote Shares upon closing of the initial Business Combination.

 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, primarily due to changes in fair value of the warrant liability, which are not currently recognized in taxable income, non-deductible start-up costs, change in fair value of Capital Contribution Note, and the valuation allowance on the deferred tax assets. While ASC 740 identifies usage of an effective annual tax rate for purposes of an interim provision, it does allow for estimating individual elements in the current period if they are significant, unusual or infrequent. Computing the effective tax rate for the Company is complicated due to the potential impact of the Company s change in fair value of warrants (or any other change in fair value of a complex financial instrument), the timing of any potential business combination expenses and the actual interest income that will be recognized during the year. The Company has taken a position as to the calculation of income tax expense in a current period based on ASC 740-270-25-3 which states, If an entity is unable to estimate a part of its ordinary income or loss or the related tax provision or benefit but is otherwise able to make a reasonable estimate, the tax provision or benefit applicable to the item that cannot be estimated shall be reported in the interim period in which the item is reported. The Company believes its calculation to be a reliable estimate and allows it to properly take into account the usual elements that can impact its annualized book income and its impact on the effective tax rate. As such, the Company is computing its taxable income or loss and associated income tax provision or benefit based on actual results through September 30, 2024 and 2023. ASC 740 also clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement process for financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. For those benefits to be recognized, a tax position must be more-likely-than-not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities. ASC 740 also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. The Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits. There were unrecognized tax benefits and amounts accrued for interest and penalties as of September 30, 2024 and 2023. The Company is currently not aware of any issues under review that could result in significant payments, accruals, or material deviation from its position. The Company has identified the United States as its only major tax jurisdiction. The Company is subject to income tax examinations by major taxing authorities since inception. These examinations may include questioning the timing and amount of deductions, the nexus of income among various tax jurisdictions and compliance with federal and state tax laws. The Company s management does not expect that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits will materially change over the next twelve months. The Company was formed in 2021 and files U.S. federal and various state income tax returns. All tax periods since inception remain open to examination by the taxing jurisdictions to which the Company is subject. ASC 740 prescribes a recognition threshold and a measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. For those benefits to be recognized, a tax position must be more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities. The Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense.

 and , respectively, in excise taxes payable related to cumulative share redemptions as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. In accordance with ASC 340-10-S99-1, the liability does not impact the condensed consolidated statements of operations and is offset against accumulated deficit because additional paid-in capital is not available. Because the Company did not complete a Business Combination by December 31, 2023, any additional redemption or other repurchase that occurs in connection with an initial Business Combination may be subject to the excise tax. Whether and to what extent the Company would be subject to the excise tax would depend on a number of factors, including (i) the fair market value of the redemptions and repurchases in connection with the Business Combination, (ii) the nature and amount of the equity issued in connection with the Business Combination (or otherwise issued not in connection with the Business Combination but issued within the same taxable year of the Business Combination), and (iii) the content of regulations and other guidance from the U.S. Department of the Treasury. During the second quarter, the IRS issued final regulations with respect to the timing and payment of the excise tax. Pursuant to those regulations, the Company would need to file a return and remit payment for any liability incurred during the period from January 1, 2023 to December 31, 2023 on or before October 31, 2024. The Company is currently evaluating its options with respect to payment of this obligation. If the Company is unable to pay its obligation in full, it will be subject to additional interest and penalties which are currently estimated at interest per annum and a underpayment penalty per month or portion of a month up to of the total liability for any amount that is unpaid from November 1, 2024 until paid in full.

Otherwise, such loans would be repaid only out of funds held outside the Trust Account. In the event that the initial Business Combination does not close, the Company may use a portion of the working capital held outside the Trust Account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from the Trust Account would be used to repay such loaned amounts. Up to of such loans may be convertible into Private Placement Warrants of the post Business Combination entity, at a price of per warrant at the option of the lender.

In December 2023 one of the underwriters waived their right to receive the deferred underwriters commission and in August 2024 a second underwriter waived their right to receive the deferred underwriters commission. As a result, neither underwriter will receive additional underwriting commissions in connection with the closing of a Business Combination. The Company considers the deferred underwriters commission an offering cost. Offering costs are charged to stockholders equity or the consolidated statement of operations based on the relative value of the Public Warrants to the proceeds received from the Units sold upon the completion of the IPO. Upon the waiver of these offering costs, a portion of these offering costs were recorded to the consolidated statement of operations and to stockholders equity.

In no event will the Company be required to net cash settle any warrant. In the event that a registration statement is not effective for the exercised warrants, the purchaser of a unit containing such warrant will have paid the full purchase price for the unit solely for the share of Class A common stock underlying such Unit.

 under the Capital Contribution Note. The fair value of the Capital Contribution Note includes both the fair value of the shares in consideration for the Capital Calls and the principal as of each reporting date.

For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recognized an unrealized gain of and , respectively, on the change in the fair value of the Capital Contribution Note in the consolidated statements of operations. As of September 30, 2024, the fair value of the Capital Contribution Note was (see Note 7). Warrant Liability Private Placement Warrants 3 Capital Contribution Note 3

 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, cash held in the Trust Account was held in an interest-bearing demand deposit account. Such cash in the Trust Account is presented on the condensed consolidated balance sheets at fair value. The Company s warrant liability for the Public Warrants is based on unadjusted quoted prices at the close of market. At September 30, 2024, there was insufficient trading volume for the Company s Public Warrants to be classified as Level 1 and as a result, they were classified as Level 2. At December 31, 2023, the Company determined there was sufficient trading activity to classify its Public Warrants as Level 1. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company used a Monte Carlo simulation model to value the Private Placement Warrants using unobservable inputs. Management utilizes significant judgment to determine the values of these unobservable inputs. Significant deviations from these estimates and inputs could result in a material change in fair value. The key inputs used to determine the fair value of the Private Placement Warrants are classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. The key inputs into the valuation models used to value the Private Placement Warrants were as follows: Risk-free interest rate Expected term in years years years Expected volatility Exercise price Public warrant price To the extent that valuations are based on models or inputs that are less observable or unobservable in the market, the determination of fair value requires more judgment. Because of the inherent uncertainty of valuations, those estimated values may be materially higher or lower than the values that would have been used had a ready market for the investments existed. Accordingly, the degree of judgment exercised by the Company in determining fair value is greatest for investments categorized in Level 3.

Overview We are a blank check company incorporated on February 18, 2021, for the purpose of effecting a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses or entities (a Business Combination ). We intend to effectuate our initial business combination using cash from the proceeds of our offering and the sale of the private placement warrants, our shares, debt or a combination of cash, equity and debt. We expect to continue to incur significant costs in the pursuit of our acquisition plans. We cannot assure you that our plans to complete a Business Combination will be successful.

In December 2023, one of the underwriters waived their right to receive the deferred underwriters commission and in August 2024 a second underwriter waived their right to receive the deferred underwriters commission.

On May 31, 2024, our stockholders approved at the special meeting of stockholders a proposal to amend our charter to extend the date by which we have to consummate a Business Combination from June 3, 2024 to March 3, 2025, or such earlier date as may be determined by the board of directors of the Company (such later date, the Second Extended Date ).

Registration Rights Agreement The Merger Agreement provides that, in connection with the Closing, New CND, certain stockholders of the Company (including the Sponsor) and certain stockholders of Events.com will enter into a registration rights agreement (the Registration Rights Agreement ), pursuant to which New CND will agree to register for resale certain shares of New CND common stock and other equity securities that are held by the parties thereto from time to time. The foregoing descriptions of the Merger Agreement, the Lock - Up Agreement, the Sponsor Support Agreement, the Stockholder Support Agreement, the Tax Receivable Agreement, the Registration Rights Agreement and other agreements and transactions contemplated thereunder are not complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the respective agreements, copies of which (or the forms of which, as applicable) are respectively filed as exhibits to the Current Report on Form 8 - K filed with the SEC on August 27, 2024 . Events.com Interim Financing The Company accounts for the funds received and receivable recognized in association with the Interim Financing from Events.com in accordance with SAB Topic 5.A. As such, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company reported the 525,000 cash received and the 16,600 due from Events.com as a reduction in operating costs on the consolidated statement of operations and the 16,600 as financing proceeds receivable on the consolidated balance sheet at September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had received 525,000 and is due an additional 16,600. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company has recognized a reduction in operating costs of 541,600.

 Results of Operations We have neither engaged in any operations nor generated any revenues to date. Our only activities since inception have been organizational activities and those necessary for our initial public offering IPO and activities related to seeking and consummating a business combination with Events.com. We do not expect to generate any operating revenues until after completion of our initial business combination. Until such time that a business combination occurs, we will generate non-operating income in the form of interest income on cash and cash equivalents from the proceeds derived from the Initial Public Offering, and non-operating income or expense from the changes in the fair value of warrant liability and Capital Contribution Note. There has been no significant change in our financial or trading position and no material adverse change has occurred since the date of our audited financial statements. Until the completion of our initial business combination, we expect to incur increased expenses as a result of being a public company (for legal, financial reporting, accounting and auditing compliance), as well as for due diligence expenses. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we had net loss of 4,483,056, which consisted of operating costs of 838,843, change in the fair value of the warrant liability of 294,732, change in fair value of Capital Contribution Note of 3,956,783, and income taxes of 42,537, partially offset by income from cash held in the Trust Account of 252,558, and recovery of offering costs attributable to warrants of 397,281. For the three months ended September 30, 2023, we had net income of 112,410, which consisted of other income of 1,655 and income from investments held in the Trust Account of 3,088,363, partially offset by change in the fair value of the warrant liability of 947,343, operating costs of 1,391,861 and income taxes of 638,404. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we had net loss of 2,686,643, which consisted of operating costs of 1,749,558, excess of fair value of Capital Contribution Note over proceeds at issuance of 565,079, change in fair value of Capital Contribution Note of 3,334,957, and income taxes of 638,153, offset by income from cash held in the Trust Account of 3,188,789, offering costs attributable to warrant liability of 397,281, interest earned on operating bank account of 34 and change in the fair value of the warrant liability of 15,000. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we had net income of 5,704,456, which consisted of change in the fair value of the warrant liability of 168,437, other income of 5,228 and income from investments held in the Trust Account of 9,501,203, partially offset by operating costs of 2,005,514 and income taxes of 1,964,898. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, operating costs were decreased by 541,600 related to Events.com Interim Financing as discussed in Note 2. Liquidity and Capital Resources As of September 30, 2024, we had available to us 739,144 of cash held outside the Trust Account. We will use cash primarily to perform business due diligence on prospective target businesses, travel to and from the offices or similar locations of prospective target businesses or their representatives or owners, review corporate documents and material agreements of prospective target businesses, structure, negotiate and complete a business combination, to pay our administrative fees, and to pay taxes to the extent the interest earned on the Trust Account is not sufficient or available to pay our taxes. Additionally, the Company has incurred an excise tax liability of 2,687,721, of which approximately 1,360,000 is payable on October 31, 2024. The Company currently has insufficient funds to pay this liability, absent any additional financing. On March 28, 2024, the Company entered into the March Subscription Agreement with the Sponsor and the Capital Contribution Note Investor, pursuant to which the Capital Contribution Note Investor has agreed to provide 600,000 to the Company under the Capital Contribution Note as discussed in Note 6. As of September 30, 2024, the Company has borrowed 600,000 under such note.

 On May 31, 2024, the Company issued an unsecured promissory note (the Note in the principal amount of up to 650,000 to the Sponsor, a significant stockholder of the Company, which may be drawn down from time to time prior to the Maturity Date (defined below) upon request by the Company. The Note amended, replaced and superseded in its entirety that certain promissory note, dated May 3, 2022, made by the Company in favor of the Sponsor in the principal amount of up to 350,000 (the Original Note ), and any unpaid principal balance of the indebtedness evidenced by the Original Note has been merged into and evidenced by the Note. The Note does not bear interest and the principal balance will be payable on the date on which the Company consummates its initial business combination (such date, the Maturity Date ). The Note is subject to customary events of default, the occurrence of certain of which automatically triggers the unpaid principal balance of the Note and all other sums payable with regard to the Note becoming immediately due and payable. The Company has not borrowed any amount as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, and through the date of filing of this Form 10-Q. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement with Events.com, the Merger Agreement provides for the parties to cooperate, between the date of the Merger Agreement and the Closing, to raise capital for Events.com through the sale of equity securities, or securities convertible into equity securities (the Interim Financing ). In association with the Merger Agreement, Events.com will be required to pay to the Company an amount based on funds raised by Events.com (see Note 2). As of September 30, 2024, the Company had received 525,000 and is due an additional 16,600. If the estimate of the costs of identifying a target business, undertaking in-depth due diligence and negotiating a Business Combination are less than the actual amount necessary to do so, the Company may have insufficient funds available to operate our business prior to completing a Business Combination. Moreover, the Company may need to obtain additional financing either to complete a Business Combination or because the Company becomes obligated to redeem a significant number of additional public shares upon consummation of a Business Combination, in which case the Company may issue additional securities or incur debt in connection with such Business Combination. Subject to compliance with applicable securities laws, the Company would only complete such financing simultaneously with the completion of a Business Combination. If the Company is unable to complete a Business Combination because it does not have sufficient funds available, the Company will be forced to cease operations and liquidate the Trust Account. In addition, following a Business Combination, if cash on hand is insufficient, the Company may need to obtain additional financing in order to meet its obligations. The Company has until March 3, 2025, or during any Extension Period, to consummate a Business Combination. If a Business Combination is not consummated by this date, there will be a mandatory liquidation and subsequent dissolution of the Company. Although the Company intends to consummate a Business Combination on or before March 3, 2025, or during any Extension Period, it is uncertain whether the Company will be able to consummate a Business Combination by this time. In connection with the Company s assessment of going concern considerations in accordance with ASC Subtopic 205-40, Presentation of Financial Statements Going Concern , Management has determined that the mandatory liquidation, should a Business Combination not occur and potential subsequent dissolution, as well as the potential for the Company to have insufficient funds available to operate our business prior to completing a Business Combination, raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. No adjustments have been made to the carrying amounts of assets or liabilities should the Company be required to liquidate after March 3, 2025, or during any Extension Period. Off-Balance Sheet Financing Arrangements We have no obligations, assets or liabilities, which would be considered off-balance sheet arrangements as of September 30, 2024. We do not participate in transactions that create relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, often referred to as variable interest entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements. We have not entered into any off-balance sheet financing arrangements, established any special purpose entities, guaranteed any debt or commitments of other entities, or purchased any non-financial assets. Contractual Obligations We do not have any long-term debt, capital lease obligations, operating lease obligations or long-term liabilities, other than discussed below, that affects the liquidity or capital resources of the Company. We have an agreement to pay an affiliate of the Sponsor a monthly fee of 20,000 for office space, administrative and support services.

 On May 31, 2024, the Company issued an unsecured promissory note (the Note in the principal amount of up to 650,000 to the Sponsor, a significant stockholder of the Company, which may be drawn down from time to time prior to the Maturity Date (defined below) upon request by the Company. The Note amended, replaced and superseded in its entirety that certain promissory note, dated May 3, 2022, made by the Company in favor of the Sponsor in the principal amount of up to 350,000 (the Original Note ), and any unpaid principal balance of the indebtedness evidenced by the Original Note has been merged into and evidenced by the Note. The Note does not bear interest and the principal balance will be payable on the date on which the Company consummates its initial business combination (such date, the Maturity Date ). The Company has not borrowed any amount as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, and through the date of filing of this Form 10-Q. Our underwriters are entitled to a deferred underwriting commission of 343,120 of the gross proceeds of the IPO held in the Trust Account upon the completion of the Company s initial Business Combination subject to the terms of the underwriting agreement. On August 21, 2023, we engaged a capital markets advisor in connection with seeking an extension for completing a Business Combination, a possible acquisition of a third party by merger, consolidation, acquisition of stock or assets or other business combination, and as a placement agent in connection with a private placement of debt, equity, equity-linked or convertible securities. We agreed to pay the capital markets advisor a transaction fee in connection with the services provided, payable upon and subject to our consummation of an initial business combination Capital Markets Advisor Fee ). The fee consists of a fixed and determinable portion and a variable portion contingent upon certain future events expected to take place upon completion of a Business Combination. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, 1,000,000 was accrued for the fee as the amount was fixed and determinable. These costs may be paid using the proceeds of the cash available once a Business Combination is complete. On March 28, 2024, the Company entered into the March Subscription Agreement with the Sponsor and the Capital Contribution Note Investor, pursuant to which the Sponsor sought to raise 600,000 to provide working capital to the Company. The Company will request funds from the Sponsor for working capital purposes Drawdown Request ). Upon at least five (5) calendar days prior written notice, the Sponsor may request a drawdown in order to meet the Sponsor s commitment to the SPAC under a Drawdown Request Capital Call ). In consideration of the March Subscription Agreement, the Company will issue 600,000 Class A common shares to the Capital Contribution Note Investor at the Closing. Any amounts funded by the Sponsor to the Company under a Drawdown Request shall not accrue interest and shall be promptly repaid by the Company to the Sponsor upon the closing of an initial Business Combination. Following receipt of such sums from the Company, and in any event within five (5) business days of the closing of an initial Business Combination, the Sponsor or the Company shall pay the Capital Contribution Note Investor an amount equal to Capital Calls funded under the March Subscription Agreement (the Business Combination Payment ). The Company and Sponsor are jointly and severally obligated to make the Business Combination Payment to the Capital Contribution Note Investor. The Capital Contribution Note Investor may elect at the closing of an initial Business Combination to receive such Business Combination Payment in cash or Class A common stock at a rate of one share of Class A common stock for each 10.00 of the Capital Calls funded under the March Subscription Agreement. If the Company liquidates without consummating a Business Combination, any amounts remaining in the Sponsor s or the Company s cash accounts (excluding any amounts in the Trust Account) after paying any outstanding third-party invoices will be paid to the Capital Contribution Note Investor within ten (10) days of the liquidation. The Company classified the Capital Contribution Note as a liability and elected the fair value option, and records changes in fair value at each reporting period in the consolidated statements of operations. The fair value of the Capital Contribution Note will include both the fair value of the 600,000 shares in consideration for the Capital Calls and the principal as of each reporting date. As of September 30, 2024, the Company has borrowed 600,000 under such note and no additional borrowings are available under this note. Critical Accounting Estimates We prepare our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements also requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, costs and expenses and related disclosures. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ significantly from the estimates made by our management. There have been no material changes to our critical estimates from those disclosed in our financial statements and the related notes and other financial information included in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on March 1, 2024, other than discussed below.

 Capital Contribution Note We elected to account for the Capital Contribution Note entered into with the Capital Contribution Note Investor and the Sponsor pursuant to the fair value option under ASC 825 wherein the financial instrument is initially measured at its issue-date estimated fair value and subsequently remeasured at estimated fair value on a recurring basis at each reporting period date. Differences between the face value of the Capital Contribution Note and fair value at issuance are recognized as either an expense in the consolidated statement of operations (if issued at a premium) or as a capital contribution (if issued at a discount). Any material changes in the estimated fair value of the Capital Contribution Note are recognized as non-cash gains or losses in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. The fair value of the Capital Contribution Note will include both the fair value of the 600,000 shares in consideration for the Capital Calls as described in Note 6 and the principal as of each reporting date. The fair value of our Capital Contribution Note requires significate estimates by management. Deviations from these estimates could result in a significate difference to our financial results. JOBS Act On April 5, 2012, the JOBS Act was signed into law. The JOBS Act contains provisions that, among other things, relax certain reporting requirements for qualifying public companies. We will qualify as an emerging growth company and under the JOBS Act will be allowed to comply with new or revised accounting pronouncements based on the effective date for private (not publicly traded) companies. We are electing to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards, and as a result, we may not comply with new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for non-emerging growth companies. As a result, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with new or revised accounting pronouncements as of public company effective dates. Additionally, we are in the process of evaluating the benefits of relying on the other reduced reporting requirements provided by the JOBS Act. Subject to certain conditions set forth in the JOBS Act, if, as an emerging growth company , we choose to rely on such exemptions we may not be required to, among other things: (1) provide an auditor s attestation report on our system of internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act; (2) provide all of the compensation disclosure that may be required of non-emerging growth public companies under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act; (3) comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the PCAOB regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor s report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements (auditor discussion and analysis); and (4) disclose certain executive compensation-related items such as the correlation between executive compensation and performance and comparisons of the CEO s compensation to median employee compensation. These exemptions will apply for a period of five years following the completion of the IPO or until we are no longer an emerging growth company, whichever is earlier. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk . We are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information otherwise required under this item. Item 4. Controls and Procedures . Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial and accounting officer or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. We do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all errors and all instances of fraud. Disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the disclosure controls and procedures are met. Further, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all disclosure controls and procedures, no evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures can provide absolute assurance that we have detected all our control deficiencies and instances of fraud, if any. The design of disclosure controls and procedures also is based partly on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions.

 As required by Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. Based upon their evaluation, and due to a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting over the accounting for complex financial instruments, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) were not effective as of September 30, 2024. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024, covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. The Company has made changes in its internal control over financial reporting to enhance our processes to identify and appropriately apply applicable accounting requirements to better evaluate and understand the nuances of the complex accounting standards that apply to our financial statements, including providing enhanced access to accounting literature, research materials and documents and increased communication among our personnel and third-party professionals with whom we consult regarding complex accounting applications. The Company can offer no assurance that these changes will ultimately have the intended effects.

Any of these factors could result in a significant or material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. Additional risk factors not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business or results of operations. Item 2.

On September 28, 2021, in connection with the sale of Option Units, the Company consummated a private sale of an additional 401,300 Private Placement Warrants to the Sponsors (the Additional Private Placement Warrants at a price of 1.50 per Additional Private Placement Warrant, generating gross proceeds of 601,950. For a description of the use of the proceeds generated in our Initial Public Offering, see Part I, Item 2 of this Quarterly Report. On August 29, 2023, the Company s stockholders approved at the special meeting of stockholders a proposal to amend the Company s charter to extend the date by which the Company has to consummate a business combination from the Termination Date to the Extended Date. In connection with the votes to approve the Charter Amendment, the holders of 13,310,731 shares of Class A common stock of the Company properly exercised their right to redeem their shares for cash at a redemption price of approximately 10.35 per share, for an aggregate redemption amount of 137,792,552, leaving 152,164,096 in the Trust Account immediately after the redemptions.
