DEFINED TERMS 
 Invitation Homes Inc. INVH ), a real estate investment trust REIT ), conducts its operations through Invitation Homes Operating Partnership LP INVH LP ). Through THR Property Management L.P., a wholly owned subsidiary of INVH LP, and its wholly owned subsidiaries (collectively, the Manager ), we provide all management and other administrative services with respect to the properties we own. The Manager also provides professional property and asset management services to portfolio owners of single-family homes for lease, including our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures. Unless the context suggests otherwise, references in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q to Invitation Homes, the Company, we, our, and us refer to INVH and its consolidated subsidiaries. 
 In this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q: 
 average monthly rent represents average monthly rental income per home for occupied properties in an identified population of homes over the measurement period and reflects the impact of non-service rent concessions and contractual rent increases amortized over the life of the related lease. We believe average monthly rent reflects pricing trends that significantly impact rental revenues over time, making average monthly rent useful to management and external stakeholders as a means of evaluating changes in rental revenues across periods; 
 average occupancy for an identified population of homes represents (i) the total number of days that the homes in such population were occupied during the measurement period, divided by (ii) the total number of days that the homes in such population were owned during the measurement period. We believe average occupancy significantly impacts rental revenues in a given period, making comparisons of average occupancy across different periods helpful to management and external stakeholders in evaluating changes in rental revenues across periods; 
 Carolinas includes Charlotte-Concord-Gastonia, NC-SC, Greensboro-High Point, NC, Raleigh-Cary, NC, Durham-Chapel Hill, NC, and Winston-Salem, NC; 
 core markets refers to markets where we have meaningful scale and the ability to conduct business using our existing operating platform. Our current 16 core markets are identified on our portfolio table in Part I. Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Our Portfolio; 
 days to re-resident for an individual home represents the number of days between (i) the date the prior resident moves out of a home and (ii) the date the next resident is granted access to the same home, which is deemed to be the earlier of the next resident s contractual lease start date and the next resident s move-in date. Days to re-resident impacts our average occupancy and thus our rental revenues, making comparisons of days to re-resident helpful to management and external stakeholders in evaluating changes in rental revenues across periods; 
 in-fill refers to markets, MSAs, submarkets, neighborhoods, or other geographic areas that are typified by significant population densities and low availability of land suitable for development into competitive properties, resulting in limited opportunities for new construction; 
 Metropolitan Statistical Area or MSA is defined by the United States Office of Management and Budget as a region associated with at least one urbanized area that has a population of at least 50,000 and comprises the central county or counties containing the core, plus adjacent outlying counties having a high degree of social and economic integration with the central county or counties as measured through commuting; 
 net effective rental rate growth for any home represents the percentage difference between the monthly rent from an expiring lease and the monthly rent from the next lease and, in each case, reflects the impact of non-service rent concessions and contractual rent increases amortized over the life of the related lease. Leases are either renewal leases, where our current resident chooses to stay for a subsequent lease term, or a new lease, where our previous resident moves out and a new resident signs a lease to occupy the same home. Net effective rental rate growth drives changes in our average monthly rent, making net effective rental rate growth useful to management and external stakeholders as a means of evaluating changes in rental revenues across periods; 
 Northern California includes Sacramento-Roseville-Folsom, CA, San Francisco-Oakland-Berkeley, CA, Stockton, CA, Vallejo, CA, and Yuba City, CA; 
 4 

PSF means per square foot. When comparing homes or cohorts of homes, we believe PSF calculations help management and external stakeholders normalize metrics for differences in property size, enabling more meaningful comparisons based on characteristics other than property size; 
 Same Store or Same Store portfolio includes, for a given reporting period, wholly owned homes that have been stabilized and seasoned, excluding homes that have been sold, homes that have been identified for sale to an owner occupant and have become vacant, homes that have been deemed inoperable or significantly impaired by casualty loss events or force majeure, homes acquired in portfolio transactions that are deemed not to have undergone renovations of sufficiently similar quality and characteristics as the existing Invitation Homes Same Store portfolio, and homes in markets that we have announced an intent to exit where we no longer operate a significant number of homes for the primary purpose of income generation. Homes are considered stabilized if they have (i) completed an initial renovation and (ii) entered into at least one post-initial renovation lease. An acquired portfolio that is both leased and deemed to be of sufficiently similar quality and characteristics as the existing Invitation Homes Same Store portfolio may be considered stabilized at the time of acquisition. Homes are considered to be seasoned once they have been stabilized for at least 15 months prior to January 1st of the year in which the Same Store portfolio was established. We believe information about the portion of our portfolio that has been fully operational for the entirety of a given reporting period and its prior year comparison period provides management and external stakeholders with meaningful information about the performance of our comparable homes across periods and about trends in our organic business; 
 Southeast United States includes our Atlanta and Carolinas markets; 
 South Florida includes Miami-Fort Lauderdale-Pompano Beach, FL, and Port St. Lucie, FL; 
 Southern California includes Los Angeles-Long Beach-Anaheim, CA, Oxnard-Thousand Oaks-Ventura, CA, Riverside-San Bernardino-Ontario, CA, and San Diego-Chula Vista-Carlsbad, CA; 
 total homes or total portfolio refers to the total number of homes we own, whether or not stabilized, and excludes any properties previously acquired in purchases that have been subsequently rescinded or vacated. Unless otherwise indicated, total homes or total portfolio refers to wholly owned homes and excludes homes owned in joint ventures. Additionally, unless the context otherwise requires, all measures in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are presented on a total portfolio basis; 
 turnover rate represents the number of instances that homes in an identified population become unoccupied in a given period, divided by the number of homes in such population. To the extent the measurement period shown is less than 12 months, the turnover rate may be reflected on an annualized basis. We believe turnover rate impacts average occupancy and thus our rental revenues, making comparisons of turnover rate helpful to management and external stakeholders in evaluating changes in rental revenues across periods. In addition, turnover can impact our cost to maintain homes, making changes in turnover rate useful to management and external stakeholders in evaluating changes in our property operating and maintenance expenses across periods; and 
 Western United States includes our Southern California, Northern California, Seattle, Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Denver markets.

 Significant Risks and Uncertainties 
 Our financial condition and results of operations are subject to risks related to overall unfavorable global and United States economic conditions (including inflation), high unemployment levels, uncertainty in financial markets (including as a result of events affecting financial institutions, such as bank failures), ongoing geopolitical tension, and a general decline in business activity and/or consumer confidence. These factors could adversely affect (i) our ability to acquire, dispose of, or effectively manage single-family homes, (ii) our access to financial markets on attractive terms, or at all, and (iii) the value of our homes and our business that could cause us to recognize impairments in value of our tangible assets or goodwill. Inflationary pressures, bank failures, and other unfavorable global and regional economic conditions, as well as geopolitical events, may also negatively impact consumer income, credit availability, interest rates, and spending, among other factors, which may adversely impact our business, financial condition, cash flows, and results of operations, including the ability of our residents to pay rent. These factors, which include labor shortages and inflationary increases in labor and material costs, have impacted and may continue to impact certain aspects of our business. 
 Accounting Policies

 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, interest rate swap instruments were used to hedge the variable cash flows associated with existing variable-rate interest payments. Amounts reported in accumulated other comprehensive income related to derivatives will be reclassified to interest expense as interest payments are made on our variable-rate debt. During the next 12 months, we estimate that will be reclassified to earnings as a decrease in interest expense. 
 Non-Designated Hedges 
 Concurrent with entering into certain of the mortgage loan agreements, we entered into or acquired and maintain interest rate cap agreements with terms and notional amounts equivalent to the terms and amounts of the mortgage loans made by the third-party lenders. To the extent that the maturity date of a mortgage loan is extended through an exercise of or more extension options, a replacement or extension interest rate cap agreement must be executed with terms similar to those associated with the initial interest rate cap agreement and strike prices equal to the greater of the interest rate cap strike price and the interest rate at which the debt service coverage ratio (as defined) is not less than to 1.0. The interest rate cap agreement, including all of our rights to payments owed by the counterparties and all other rights, has been pledged as additional collateral for the mortgage loan. Additionally, in certain instances, in order to minimize the cash impact of purchasing required interest rate caps, we simultaneously sell interest rate caps (which have identical terms and notional amounts) such that the purchase price and sales proceeds of the related interest rate caps are intended to offset each other. As of September 30, 2024, the remaining interest rate cap has a strike price of .

In addition, we issue OP Units from time to time which, upon vesting, are redeemable for shares of our common stock on a -for-one basis or, in our sole discretion, cash and are reflected as non-controlling interests on our condensed consolidated balance sheets and statements of equity. As of September 30, 2024, outstanding OP Units are redeemable.

 At the Market Equity Program 
 On December 20, 2021, we entered into distribution agreements with a syndicate of banks (the Agents and the Forward Sellers ), and on June 14, 2024, we entered into distribution agreements with additional Agents and Forward Sellers. Pursuant to these agreements, we may sell, from time to time, up to an aggregate sales price of of our common stock through the Agents and the Forward Sellers (the ATM Equity Program ). In addition to the issuance of shares of our common stock, the distribution agreements permit us to enter into separate forward sale transactions with certain forward purchasers who may borrow shares from third parties and, through affiliated Forward Sellers, offer a number of shares of our common stock equal to the number of shares of our common stock underlying the particular forward transaction. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we did sell any shares of common stock under the ATM Equity Program. As of September 30, 2024, remains available for future offerings under the ATM Equity Program. 
 Dividends 
 To qualify as a REIT, we are required to distribute annually to our stockholders at least 90 of our REIT taxable income, without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gains, and to pay tax at regular corporate rates to the extent that we annually distribute less than 100 of our net taxable income. We intend to pay quarterly dividends to our stockholders that in the aggregate are approximately equal to or exceed our net taxable income in the relevant year. The timing, form, and amount of distributions, if any, to our stockholders, will be at the sole discretion of our board of directors.

Time-vesting RSUs are participating securities for earnings (loss) per share EPS purposes, and performance and market based RSUs PRSUs and Outperformance Awards are not. For a detailed discussion of RSUs and PRSUs issued prior to January 1, 2024, refer to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 Share-Based Awards 
 The following summarizes our share-based award activity during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Annual Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP ): 
 Annual LTIP Awards Granted: During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we granted RSUs pursuant to LTIP awards. Each award includes components which vest based on time-vesting conditions, market based vesting conditions, and performance based vesting conditions, each of which is subject to continued employment through the applicable vesting date. 
 LTIP time-vesting RSUs vest in equal annual installments based on an anniversary date of March 1st. LTIP PRSUs may be earned based on the achievement of certain measures over a performance period. The number of PRSUs earned will be determined based on performance achieved during the performance period for each measure at certain threshold, target, or maximum levels and corresponding payout ranges. In general, the LTIP PRSUs are earned after the end of the performance period on the date on which the performance results are certified by our compensation and management development committee (the Compensation Committee ). 
 All of the LTIP Awards are subject to certain change in control and retirement eligibility provisions that may impact these vesting schedules. 
 PRSU Results: During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, certain LTIP PRSUs vested and achieved performance in excess of the target level, resulting in the issuance of an additional shares of common stock. Such awards are reflected as an increase in the number of awards granted and vested in the table below.

 time-vesting RSUs to members of our board of directors, which will fully vest on the date of INVH s 2025 annual stockholders meeting, subject to continued service on the board of directors through such date. 
 Outperformance Awards 
 On May 1, 2019, the Compensation Committee approved equity based awards in the form of PRSUs and OP Units (the 2019 Outperformance Awards ). The 2019 Outperformance Awards included market based vesting conditions related to absolute and relative total shareholder returns TSRs over a performance period that ended on March 31, 2022. In April 2022, the absolute TSR and the relative TSR were separately calculated, and the Compensation Committee certified achievement of each at maximum achievement. The number of earned 2019 Outperformance Awards was then determined based on the earned dollar value of the awards (at maximum) and the stock price at the performance certification date, resulting in earned PRSUs and earned OP Units. Earned awards vested on the certification date in April 2022, vested on March 31, 2023, and the remaining vested on March 31, 2024. The estimated fair value of 2019 Outperformance Awards that fully vested during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was an aggregate . The aggregate grant-date fair value of the 2019 Outperformance Awards that were earned was determined based on Monte-Carlo option pricing models which estimated the probability of achievement of the TSR thresholds. The grant-date fair value was amortized ratably over each vesting period. 
 On April 1, 2022, the Compensation Committee granted equity based awards with market based vesting conditions in the form of PRSUs and OP Units (the 2022 Outperformance Awards and together with the 2019 Outperformance Awards, the Outperformance Awards ). The 2022 Outperformance Awards may be earned based on the achievement of rigorous absolute TSR and relative TSR return thresholds over a performance period ending March 31, 2025. The 2022 Outperformance Awards provide that upon completion of of the performance period, or June 30, 2024 (the Interim Measurement Date ), performance achieved as of the Interim Measurement Date was calculated consistent with the award terms. To the extent performance through the Interim Measurement Date resulted in a payout if the performance period had ended on that date, a minimum of of such hypothetical payout amount is guaranteed as a minimum level payout for the full performance period, so long as certain minimum levels of relative TSR are achieved for the full performance period. As of the Interim Measurement Date, the relative TSR component of the 2022 Outperformance Awards was calculated at maximum achievement, while the absolute TSR component was below threshold. As such, overall performance as of the Interim Measurement Date results in a payout of the 2022 Outperformance Awards, or a guaranteed minimum payout of , provided that certain minimum levels of relative TSR are achieved for the full performance period. 
 The final award achievement will be equal to the greater of the payouts determined based on the Interim Measurement Date and performance through March 31, 2025. Upon completion of the performance period, the dollar value of the awards earned under the absolute and relative TSR components will be separately calculated, and the number of earned 2022 Outperformance Awards will be determined based on the earned dollar value of the awards and the stock price at the performance certification date. Earned awards will vest on the certification date and on March 31, 2026, subject to continued employment. As of September 30, 2024, 2022 Outperformance Awards with an approximate aggregate grant-date fair value have been issued and remain outstanding. The grant-date fair value was determined based on Monte-Carlo option pricing models which estimate the probability of achievement of the TSR thresholds, and it is amortized ratably over each vesting period.

 The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the information appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements based upon our current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those set forth under Part I. Item 1A. Risk Factors of our Annual Report on Form 10-K.

 Overview 
 Invitation Homes is a leading owner and operator of single-family homes for lease, offering residents high-quality homes in sought-after neighborhoods across the United States. As of September 30, 2024, we own approximately 85,000 homes for lease which are located primarily in 16 core markets across the country. These homes help meet the needs of a growing share of Americans who prefer the ease of a leasing lifestyle over the burden of owning a home. We provide our residents access to updated homes with features they value, as well as close proximity to jobs and access to good schools. The continued demand for our product proves that the choice and flexibility we offer are attractive to many people. 
 We operate in markets with strong demand drivers, high barriers to entry, and high rent growth potential, primarily in the Western United States, Florida, and the Southeast United States. Through disciplined market and asset selection, as well as through strategic mergers and acquisitions, we designed our owned portfolio to capture the operating benefits of local density as well as economies of scale that we believe cannot be readily replicated. Since our founding in 2012, we have built a proven, vertically integrated operating platform that enables us to effectively and efficiently acquire, renovate, lease, maintain, and manage both the homes we own and those we manage on behalf of others. 
 The portfolio of homes we own average approximately 1,880 square feet with three bedrooms and two bathrooms, appealing to a resident base that we believe is less transitory than a typical multifamily resident. We invest in the upfront renovation of homes in our portfolio in order to address capital needs, reduce ongoing maintenance costs, and drive resident demand. 
 We also provide comprehensive asset and property management services to portfolio owners of single-family rental homes on a contractual basis. Our services include resident support, maintenance, marketing, and administrative functions. As of September 30, 2024, we provided property and asset management services for 25,535 homes, of which 7,619 homes were owned by our unconsolidated joint ventures. 
 At Invitation Homes, we are committed to creating a better way to live and to being a force for positive change, while at the same time advancing efforts that make our company more innovative and our processes more sustainable. Environmental, Social, and Governance initiatives are an important part of our strategic business objectives and are critical to our long-term success. 
 Our mission statement, Together with you, we make a house a home, reflects our commitment to high-touch customer service that continuously enhances residents living experiences and provides homes where individuals and families can thrive. Each aspect of our operations whether in our corporate headquarters or field offices located in our 16 core markets is driven by a resident-centric model. Our associates take our values seriously and work hard every day to honor the trust our residents have placed in us to provide clean, safe, and functional homes for them and their loved ones. In turn, we focus on ensuring that our associates are fairly compensated and that we provide a diverse, equitable, and inclusive culture where they are appreciated for who they are and what they bring to the business. We also place a strong emphasis on the impact we have in our communities and to the environment in general, and we continue to develop programs that demonstrate that commitment. In addition, we ensure that we operate under strong, well-defined governance practices and adhere to the highest ethical standards at all times.

Impact of Macroeconomic Trends 
 Continuing unfavorable global and United States economic conditions (including inflation), high unemployment levels, uncertainty in financial markets (including as a result of events affecting financial institutions, such as bank failures), ongoing geopolitical tension, and a general decline in business activity and/or consumer confidence could adversely affect (i) our ability to acquire, dispose of, or effectively manage single-family homes, (ii) our access to financial markets on attractive terms, or at all, and (iii) the value of our homes and our business that could cause us to recognize impairments in value of our tangible assets or goodwill. Inflationary pressures, bank failures, and other unfavorable global and regional economic conditions, as well as geopolitical events, may also negatively impact consumer income, credit availability, interest rates, and spending, among other factors, which may adversely impact our business, financial condition, cash flows, and results of operations, including the ability of our residents to pay rent. These factors, which include labor shortages and inflationary increases in labor and material costs, have impacted and may continue to impact certain aspects of our business. In addition, consumer confidence and spending can be materially adversely affected in response to changes in fiscal and monetary policy, declines in income or asset values, and other economic factors. For example, we have experienced and continue to expect higher levels of bad debt expense compared to pre-COVID averages, as it continues to take longer to address residents who are not current with their rent. 
 For further discussion of risks related to general economic conditions, see Part I. Item 1A. Risk Factors Risks Related to Our Business Environment and Industry Our operating results are subject to general economic conditions and risks associated with our real estate assets of our Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 Climate Change 
 Consequences of global climate change range from more frequent extreme weather events to extensive governmental policy developments and shifts in consumer preferences, which have the potential individually or collectively to disrupt our business as well as negatively affect our suppliers, contractors, and residents. Experiencing or addressing the various physical, regulatory, and transition risks from climate change may significantly reduce our revenues and profitability or cause us to generate losses. Government authorities and various interest groups are promoting laws and regulations relating to climate change, including regulations aimed at drastically increasing reporting and governance related to climate change as well as focused on limiting greenhouse gas emissions and the implementation of green building codes. In March 2024, the SEC adopted the final rule under SEC Release No. 33-11275, The Enhancement and Standardization of Climate-Related Disclosures for Investors . This rule will require registrants to disclose certain climate-related information in registration statements and annual reports. Subsequent to issuance, the rules became the subject of litigation, and the SEC has issued a stay to allow the legal process to proceed. The SEC has indicated that it will publish a new effective date for the rules, if ultimately implemented, at the conclusion of the stay. These rules will be applied prospectively. We are currently assessing the effect of new rules on our condensed consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. Additionally, t he State of California recently passed the Climate Corporate Data Accountability Act and the Climate-Related Financial Risk Act that will impose broad climate-related disclosure obligations on certain companies doing business in California, including us, starting in 2026. Unless legal challenges to the foregoing new rules prevail or they are otherwise modified prior to effective dates or the effective dates are delayed, we will become subject to the rules as adopted, and they could significantly increase compliance burdens and associated regulatory costs and complexity. 
 These and future laws and regulations or any changed interpretation of existing laws and regulations may require us to make costly improvements to our existing properties beyond our current plans to decrease the impact of our homes on the environment, resulting in increased operating costs. Incorporating greater resource efficiency into our homes, whether to comply with upgraded building codes or recommended practices given a region s particular exposure to climate conditions, or undertaken to satisfy demand from increasingly environmentally conscious residents or to meet our own sustainability goals, could raise our costs to maintain our homes. In evaluating whether to implement voluntary improvements, we also consider that choosing not to enhance our homes resource efficiency can make them less attractive to municipalities and increase the vulnerability of residents in our communities to rising energy and water expenses and use restrictions. Additionally, choosing not to enhance our homes resource efficiency could make our portfolio less attractive to residents and investors. If we fail to manage transition risks effectively, our profitability and cash flow could suffer. 
 44 

We intend to continue to research, evaluate and utilize new or improved products and business practices consistent with our sustainability commitment, and believe our initiatives in this area can help put us in a better position to comply with evolving regulations directed at addressing climate change and similar environmental concerns, and to meet growing resident demand for resource-efficient homes, as further discussed in Part I. Item 1. Business Environmental, Social, and Governance of our Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 We recognize that climate change could have a significant impact on our portfolio of homes located in a variety of United States markets and that an increase in the number of acute weather events, natural disasters, and other climate-related events could significantly impact our business, operations, and homes. We actively consider physical risks such as the potential for natural disasters such as hurricanes, floods, droughts, and wildfires when assessing our portfolio of homes and our business processes. Such extreme climate related events are driving changes in market dynamics and stakeholder expectations and could result in disruptions to us, our suppliers, vendors, and residents. We take a proactive approach to protect our properties against potential risks related to climate change and business interruptions, and we recognize that we must continue to adapt our policies, objectives, and processes to prepare for such events and improve the resiliency of our physical properties and our business. Furthermore, climate change may reduce the availability or increase the cost of insurance for these negative impacts of natural disasters and adverse weather conditions by contributing to an increase in the incidence and severity of such natural disasters. 
 Our management and the board of directors are focused on managing our business risks, including climate change-related risks. The process to identify, manage, and integrate climate-change risk is part of our enterprise risk management program. For more information on risks related to climate change, see Part I. Item 1A. Risk Factors Risks Related to Environmental, Social, and Governance Issues Climate change and related environmental issues, related legislative and regulatory responses to climate change, and the transition to a lower-carbon economy may adversely affect our business , We are subject to risks from natural disasters such as earthquakes, wildfires, and severe weather, and We are subject to increasing scrutiny from investors and others regarding our environmental, social, governance, or sustainability responsibilities, which could result in additional costs or risks and adversely impact our reputation, associate retention, and ability to raise capital from such investors of our Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 Other Matters 
 In 2021 and 2022, we received congressional inquiries requesting information and documentation about our eviction practices during the COVID-19 pandemic, including information relating to compliance with federal eviction moratorium requirements, cooperation with impacted residents to use federal assistance funds as an alternative to eviction, and our activities in the housing market. We have responded to and have cooperated with these inquiries and information requests. 
 In January 2023, we received an inquiry from the staff of the SEC requesting information relating to our compliance with building codes and permitting requirements, related policies and procedures, and other matters. We are in the process of responding to, and cooperating with, this request. We cannot currently predict the timing, outcome, or scope of this inquiry.

Factors That Affect Our Results of Operations and Financial Condition 
 Our results of operations and financial condition are affected by numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control. See Part I. Item 1A. Risk Factors of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information regarding factors that could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Key factors that impact our results of operations and financial condition include market fundamentals, rental rates and occupancy levels, collection rates, turnover rates and days to re-resident homes, property improvements and maintenance, property acquisitions and renovations, and financing arrangements. Sensitivity to many of these factors has been heightened as a result of current macroeconomic conditions, including sustained economic inflation, bank failures, and high interest rates. Additionally, each of these factors may also impact the results of operations and financial condition of our joint venture investments and those of third parties for whom we perform property and asset management services, which would impact the amount of management fee revenues and income (loss) from investments in unconsolidated joint ventures that we earn. 
 Market Fundamentals: Our results are impacted by housing market fundamentals and supply and demand conditions in our markets, particularly in the Western United States and Florida, which represented 72.2 of our rental revenues and other property income during the three months ended September 30, 2024. We actively monitor the impact of macroeconomic conditions on market fundamentals and quickly implement changes in pricing as market fundamentals shift. 
 Rental Rates and Occupancy Levels: Rental rates and occupancy levels are primary drivers of rental revenues and other property income. Our rental rates and occupancy levels are affected by macroeconomic factors and local and property-level factors, including market conditions, seasonality, resident defaults, and the amount of time it takes to prepare a home for its next resident and re-lease homes when residents vacate. An important driver of rental rate growth is our ability to increase monthly rents from expiring leases, which typically have a term of one to two years. 
 Collection Rates: Our rental revenues and other property income are impacted by the rate at which we collect such revenues from our residents. Despite our efforts to assist residents facing financial hardships who need flexibility to fulfill their lease obligations, a portion of amounts receivable may not ultimately be collected. We may also be constrained in our ability to collect resident receivables due to local ordinances restricting residential lease compliance options. Any amounts billed to residents that have been deemed uncollectible along with our estimate of amounts that may ultimately be uncollectible decrease our rental revenues and other property income. 
 Turnover Rates and Days to Re-Resident: Other drivers of rental revenues and property operating and maintenance expense include the length of stay of our residents, resident turnover rates, and the number of days a home is unoccupied between residents. Our operating results are also impacted by the amount of time it takes to market and lease a property, which is a component of the number of days a home is unoccupied between residents. The period of time to market and lease a property can vary greatly and is impacted by local demand, our marketing techniques, the size of our available inventory, the ability of our suppliers and other business partners to carry out their assigned tasks and/or source labor or supply materials at ordinary levels of performance relative to the conduct of our business, and both current economic conditions and future economic outlook, including the impact of sustained inflation, bank failures, and high interest rates which could adversely affect demand for our properties. 
 Property Improvements and Maintenance: Property improvements and maintenance impact capital expenditures, property operating and maintenance expense, and rental revenues. We actively manage our homes on a total portfolio basis to determine what capital and maintenance needs may be required and what opportunities we may have to generate additional revenues or expense savings from such expenditures. As a result of recent inflationary trends, we have experienced, and expect to continue to incur, increased costs for certain materials and services necessary to improve and maintain our homes. We continue to actively manage the impact of inflation on these costs, and we believe we are able to purchase goods and services at favorable prices compared to other purchasers due to our size and scale both nationally and locally. 
 Property Acquisitions and Renovations: Future growth in rental revenues and other property income may be impacted by our ability to identify and acquire homes, our pace of property acquisitions, and the time and cost required to renovate and lease a newly acquired home. Our ability to identify and acquire single-family homes that meet our investment criteria is impacted by home prices in targeted acquisition locations, the inventory of homes available for sale through our acquisition channels, and competition for our target assets. All of these factors may be negatively impacted by current inflationary trends and high interest rates, potentially reducing the number of homes we acquire. 
 The acquisition of homes involves expenditures in addition to payment of the purchase price, including payments for acquisition fees, property inspections, closing costs, title insurance, transfer taxes, recording fees, broker commissions, property taxes, and HOA fees (when applicable). Additionally, we typically incur costs to renovate a home to prepare it for rental. The scope of renovation work varies, but may include paint, flooring, carpeting, cabinetry, appliances, plumbing 
 47 

hardware, roof replacement, HVAC replacement, and other items required to prepare the home for rental. The time and cost involved in accessing our homes and preparing them for rental can significantly impact our financial performance. The time to renovate a newly acquired property can vary significantly among homes for several reasons, including the property s acquisition channel, the condition of the property, whether the property was vacant when acquired, and whether there are any state or local restrictions on our ability to complete renovations as an essential business function. Additionally, the ability of our suppliers and other business partners to carry out their assigned tasks and/or source labor or supply materials at ordinary levels of performance relative to the conduct of our business have increased the time required to renovate our homes. As a result of recent inflationary trends, we have experienced, and expect to continue to incur, increased costs for certain materials and services necessary to renovate our homes. We continue to actively manage the impact of inflation on the cost of renovations, and we believe we are able to purchase goods and services at favorable prices compared to other purchasers due to our size and scale both nationally and locally. 
 Financing Arrangements: Financing arrangements directly impact our interest expense, our various debt instruments, and our ability to acquire and renovate homes. We have historically utilized indebtedness to fund the acquisition and renovation of new homes. Our current financing arrangements contain financial covenants and other terms and conditions, including variable interest rates in some cases, that are impacted by market conditions. Current macroeconomic conditions may continue to negatively affect volatility, availability of funds, and transaction costs (including interest rates) within financial markets. These factors may also negatively affect our ability to access financial markets as well as our business, results of operations, and financial condition. See Part II. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion regarding interest rate risk. Our future financing arrangements may not have similar terms with respect to amounts, interest rates, financial covenants, and durations. 
 
 Components of Revenues and Expenses 
 The following is a description of the components of our revenues and expenses. 
 Revenues 
 Rental Revenues and Other Property Income 
 Rental revenues, net of any concessions and bad debt (including write-offs, credit reserves, and uncollectible amounts), consist of rents collected under lease agreements related to our single-family homes for lease. We enter into leases directly with our residents, and the leases typically have a term of one to two years. 
 Other property income is comprised of: (i) resident reimbursements for utilities, HOA fines, and other charge-backs; (ii) rent and non-refundable deposits associated with pets; (iii) revenues from value-add services such as smart homes,internet and media packages, home liability insurance, and HVAC replacement filters; and (iv) various other fees, including late fees and lease termination fees, among others. 
 Management Fee Revenues 
 Management fee revenues consist of fees from property and asset management services provided to portfolio owners of single-family homes for lease, including investments in our unconsolidated joint ventures. 
 Expenses 
 Property Operating and Maintenance 
 Once a property is available for its initial lease, which we refer to as rent-ready, we incur ongoing property-related expenses, which consist primarily of property taxes, insurance, HOA fees (when applicable), market-level personnel expenses, utility expenses, repairs and maintenance, and property administration. Prior to a property being rent-ready, certain of these expenses are capitalized as building and improvements. Once a property is rent-ready, expenditures for ordinary repairs and maintenance thereafter are expensed as incurred, and we capitalize expenditures that improve or extend the life of a home.

 Revenues 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, total revenues were 660.3 million and 617.7 million, respectively. Set forth below is a discussion of changes in the individual components of total revenues. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, total portfolio rental revenues and other property income totaled 641.3 million and 614.3 million, respectively, an increase of 4.4 , driven by an increase in average monthly rent per occupied home and a 501 home increase between periods in the average number of homes owned, partially offset by a 50 bps reduction in average occupancy. 
 50 

Average occupancy for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 for the total portfolio was 95.5 and 96.0 , respectively. Average monthly rent per occupied home for the total portfolio for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 2,397 and 2,323, respectively, a 3.2 increase. For our Same Store portfolio, average occupancy was 97.0 and 97.1 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and average monthly rent per occupied home for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 2,406 and 2,321, respectively, a 3.7 increase. 
 The annualized turnover rate for the Same Store portfolio for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 24.9 and 27.2 , respectively. For the Same Store portfolio, an average home remained unoccupied for 38 and 36 days between residents for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The slight increase in days to re-resident resulted in an overall decrease in average Same Store occupancy on a year over year basis. 
 To monitor prospective changes in average monthly rent per occupied home, we compare the monthly rent from an expiring lease to the monthly rent from the next lease for the same home, in each case, net of any amortized non-service concessions, to calculate net effective rental rate growth. Leases are either renewal leases, where our current resident stays for a subsequent lease term, or new leases, where our previous resident moves out and a new resident signs a lease to occupy the same home. 
 Renewal lease net effective rental rate growth for the total portfolio averaged 4.2 and 6.4 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and new lease net effective rental rate growth for the total portfolio averaged 1.7 and 4.7 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. For our Same Store portfolio, renewal lease net effective rental rate growth averaged 4.2 and 6.5 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and new lease net effective rental rate growth averaged 1.7 and 4.6 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 Other property income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased compared to September 30, 2023, primarily due to increased utility billbacks as new leases are entered into and enhanced value-add revenue programs, among other things. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, management fee revenues totaled 19.0 million and 3.4 million, respectively. The increase is due to an increase in the number of homes for which we provide property and asset management services. As of September 30, 2024 and 2023, we provided property and asset management services for 25,535 and 3,656 homes, respectively, of which 7,619 and 3,656 homes, respectively, were owned by our unconsolidated joint ventures. 
 Expenses 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, total expenses were 590.7 million and 535.5 million, respectively. Set forth below is a discussion of changes in the individual components of total expenses. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, property operating and maintenance expense increased to 242.2 million from 229.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. In addition to a 501 home increase between periods in the average numbers of homes owned, increases in property taxes, property maintenance, and utilities resulted in the overall 5.6 net increase in property operating and maintenance expense. 
 Property management expense and general and administrative expense increased to 56.1 million from 46.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, primarily due to increased personnel and other costs related to expansion of our property and asset management platform, including costs incurred to manage 25,535 and 3,656 homes as of September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. 
 Interest expense increased to 91.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 86.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. T he increase in interest expense was primarily due to a 479.8 million increase in gross debt outstanding, as of September 30, 2024 compared to September 30, 2023. 
 Depreciation and amortization expense increased to 180.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 170.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 due to an increase in cumulative capital expenditures and a 501 home increase in the average number of homes owned during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 . 
 51 

Casualty losses, impairment, and other expenses were 20.9 million and 2.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, casualty losses, impairment, and other expenses were comprised of 20.6 million of net casualty losses for repairs from recent storm activity in excess of amounts recoverable from insurance coverage and impairment losses of 0.3 million on our single-family residential properties. During the three months ended September 30, 2023, casualty losses, impairment, and other expenses were comprised of net casualty losses of 2.4 million and impairment losses of 0.1 million on our single-family residential properties. 
 Gains (Losses) on Investments in Equity and Other Securities, net 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, gains (losses) on investments in equity and other securities, net was comprised of net unrealized losses recognized on investments held at period end . 
 Other, net 
 Other, net increased to 9.3 million of expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 2.5 million of expense for the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to settlement and other costs incurred in connection with the resolution of an inquiry from the Federal Trade Commission (the FTC and the legal dispute entitled City of San Diego et al v. Invitation Homes, Inc. , partially offset by an increase in interest income on cash balances. 
 Gain on Sale of Property, net of tax 
 Gain on sale of property, net of tax was 47.8 million and 58.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. A decrease in the number of homes sold from 397 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 310 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was the primary driver of the decrease. 
 Losses from Investments in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures 
 Our share of equity in earnings and/or losses from unconsolidated joint ventures was a net loss of 12.2 million and 4.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. T he increase in loss is primarily driven by a 2.1 million increase in our share of interest expense, 3.0 million of decreases in our share of the fair value adjustments of interest rate caps for certain of our joint ventures, and an increase in our share of depreciation expense and gain (loss) on sale of property of 2.0 million between the respective periods. These changes are a result of the formation of and commencement of operations in new joint ventures, cumulative capital expenditures, and an increase in the number of homes within our joint venture investments.

 Property management expense and general and administrative expense increased to 164.9 million from 130.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, primarily due to increased personnel and other costs related to expansion of our property and asset management platform, including costs incurred to manage 25,535 and 3,656 homes as of September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. 
 Interest expense increased to 270.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 243.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in interest expense was primarily due to 479.8 million increase in gross debt outstanding , as of September 30, 2024 compared to September 30, 2023. 
 Depreciation and amortization expense increased to 532.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 501.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 due to an increase in cumulative capital expenditures and a 1,151 home increase in the average number of homes owned during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Casualty losses, impairment, and other expenses were 35.4 million and 5.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, casualty losses, impairment, and other expenses were comprised of 35.1 million of net casualty losses for repairs from recent storm activity in excess of amounts recoverable from insurance coverage and impairment losses of 0.3 million on our single-family residential properties. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, casualty losses, impairment, and other expenses were comprised of net casualty losses of 5.2 million and impairment losses of 0.3 million on our single-family residential properties. 
 Gains (Losses) on Investments in Equity and Other Securities, net 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, gains (losses) on investments in equity and other securities, net of 1.0 million was comprised of a 1.6 million net realized gains from exercised warrants and offset by 0.6 million net unrealized losses recognized since December 31, 2023 on investments held as of September 30, 2024. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, gains (losses) on investments in equity and other securities, net of 0.1 million was comprised of net unrealized gains recognized on investments held as of September 30, 2023. 
 54 

Other, net 
 Other, net increased to 57.4 million of expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 8.0 million of expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to settlement and other costs incurred in connection with the resolution of an inquiry from the FTC and the legal dispute entitled City of San Diego et al v. Invitation Homes, Inc. , partially offset by an increase in interest income on cash balances. 
 Gain on Sale of Property, net of tax 
 Gain on sale of property, net of tax was 141.5 million and 134.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. An increase in the net proceeds per home sold for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was the primary driver of the increase. 
 Losses from Investments in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures 
 Our share of equity in earnings and/or losses from unconsolidated joint ventures was a net loss of 22.8 million and 11.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase in loss is primarily driven by a 4.5 million increase in our share of interest expense, 3.7 million of decreases in our share of fair value adjustments of interest rate caps for certain of our joint ventures and an increase in our share of depreciation expense and gain (loss) on sale of properties of 3.6 million between the respective periods. These changes are a result of the formation of and commencement of operations in new joint ventures, cumulative capital expenditures, and an increase in the number of homes within our joint venture investments. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Our liquidity and capital resources as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 include unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of 1,027.2 million and 700.6 million, respectively, a 46.6 increase primarily due to proceeds from the issuance of 500.0 million of unsecured bonds during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 New Credit Facility 
 On September 9, 2024, we entered into an amended and restated senior unsecured credit facility (the Credit Facility ). The Credit Facility provides 3,500.0 million of borrowing capacity and consists of a 1,750.0 million revolving facility (the Revolving Facility and a 1,750.0 million term loan facility (the 2024 Term Loan Facility ), both of which mature on September 9, 2028, with two six month extension options available. The Credit Facility replaced a credit facility that consisted of a 1,000.0 million revolving credit facility (the 2020 Revolving Facility and a 2,500.0 million term loan facility (the 2020 Term Loan Facility, and together with the 2020 Revolving Facility, the 2020 Credit Facility ). Proceeds from the 2024 Term Loan Facility, a 750.0 million borrowing on the Revolving Facility on the date of effectiveness of the Credit Facility, and excess cash on hand were used to fully repay the 2020 Term Loan Facility and to pay costs associated with the transaction. For both the Revolving Facility and the 2024 Term Loan Facility, spreads at closing, based on our total leverage ratio, were 5 bps lower than the spreads most recently in effect for the 2020 Credit Facility. 
 As of September 30, 2024, 1,000.0 million of our Revolving Facility is undrawn, and there are no restrictions on our ability to draw funds thereunder provided we remain in compliance with all covenants. We have no debt reaching final maturity until January 2026, provided all extension options are exercised. 
 Public Offering 
 On September 26, 2024, in a public offering under our existing shelf registration statement, we issued 500.0 million aggregate principal amount of 4.88 Senior Notes which mature on February 1, 2035. 
 Interest Rate Swap Transactions 
 In September 2024, we amended certain interest rate swap agreements and entered into 1,400.0 million of new interest rate swap agreements. As of September 30, 2024, our currently active swaps have a weighted average strike rate of 2.86 and are scheduled to terminate between November 30, 2024 and July 31, 2025, while our forward starting swaps, which will become active between December 31, 2024 and July 9, 2025 and mature between May 31, 2028 and May 31, 2029, have a weighted strike rate of 2.95 . 
 55 

Investment in Joint Venture and New Property and Asset Management Agreements 
 As of September 30, 2024, we provided property and asset management services for 25,535 homes, of which 7,619 homes were owned by our unconsolidated joint ventures. 
 On April 29, 2024, we entered into a new joint venture agreement pursuant to which we made an initial 37.5 million investment, representing a 7.2 ownership interest, in a portfolio of approximately 3,700 single-family residential properties. During the third quarter of 2024, we also began providing property and asset management services to those homes and an approximately 700 additional homes owned by our joint venture partners. 
 In March 2024, we entered into a third-party agreement to provide property and asset management services to a portfolio of approximately 3,000 single-family homes for lease. Our direct management responsibilities for these homes commenced on May 15, 2024. 
 Other 
 Our ability to access capital as well as to use cash from operations to continue to meet our liquidity needs, all of which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, could be affected by various risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the effects of general economic conditions, including inflation and interest rates, as detailed in Part I. Item 1A. Risk Factors of our Annual Report on Form 10-K.

For information about our derivative instruments that hedge floating rate debt, see Part I. Item 1. Financial Statements Note 8 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 (2) Variable interest rate loans are indexed to a Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR index rate determined by reference to a published forward-looking SOFR rate for the interest period relevant to such borrowing Term SOFR ), including any credit spread adjustments provided for in the terms of the underlying agreement Adjusted SOFR ), reflected as S in the table above. 
 (3) Weighted average years to maturity assumes all extension options are exercised, which are subject to certain conditions being met. On October 2, 2024, we provided the lender a revocable notification of our intention to make a voluntary prepayment of the then-outstanding balance of IH 2018-4 on November 8, 2024, which will result in a release of the loan s collateral of 4,905 homes with a gross book value of 1,295.0 million as of September 30, 2024. 
 57 

(4) IH 2017-1 bears interest at a fixed rate of 4.23 per annum, equal to the market determined pass-through rate payable on the certificates including applicable servicing fees. 
 (5) Effective July 3, 2023, the interest rate for IH 2018-4 is based on the weighted average spread over Term SOFR adjusted for an 0.11 credit spread adjustment. As of September 30, 2024, Term SOFR was 4.85 . 
 (6) The Secured Term Loan bears interest at a fixed rate of 3.59 per annum including applicable servicing fees for the first 11 years and for the twelfth year bears interest at a floating rate based on a spread of 147 bps over a comparable or successor rate to one month LIBOR as provided for in our loan agreement, including applicable servicing fees, subject to certain adjustments as outlined in the loan agreement. 
 (7) For secured debt, unsecured debt, and total debt, the weighted average interest rate is calculated based on September 30, 2024, Term SOFR of 4.85 adjusted for either a 0.11 or a 0.10 credit spread adjustment (Adjusted SOFR), as appropriate, and includes the impact of interest rate swap agreements effective as of that date. 
 (8) As of September 30, 2024, interest rate is based on Term SOFR of 4.85 plus the applicable margin and a 0.10 credit spread adjustment. 
 
 As part of our long-term debt strategy, our goal is to improve our credit ratings, and, over time, we generally intend to target net debt that is approximately 5.5 to 6.0 times trailing twelve months Adjusted EBITDA re (see Non-GAAP Measures EBITDA, EBITDA re , and Adjusted EBITDA re ), secured debt that is less than 20 of gross assets, and unencumbered assets that are greater than 70 of gross assets. To facilitate our long-term debt strategy we expect to seek to, among other things, (a) refinance a significant portion of our secured debt maturing in 2026 (assuming all extension options are exercised) with unsecured debt, including potential unsecured bond issuances and/or (b) repay a portion of such debt. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in implementing our long-term debt strategy, improving our credit ratings, or adhering to our targets in the short or medium term or at all, or that we will not change our strategy or targets in the future. We may from time to time fall outside of our target ranges. In addition, we cannot assure you that we will be able to access the capital and credit markets to obtain additional unsecured debt financing or that we will be able to obtain financing on terms favorable to us. For further discussion of risks related to our indebtedness, see Part I. Item 1A. Risk Factors Risks Related to Our Indebtedness, including Risk Factors Risks Related to Our Indebtedness We may be unable to obtain financing through the debt and equity markets, which would have a material adverse effect on our growth strategy and our financial condition and results of operations in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 Short-Term and Long-Term Liquidity Needs 
 Liquidity is a measure of our ability to meet potential cash requirements, maintain our assets, fund our operations, make dividend payments to our stockholders, and meet other general requirements of our business. Our liquidity, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, and other factors beyond our control. Our near-term liquidity requirements consist primarily of: 
 acquisition of homes currently under contract, including commitments to homebuilders; 
 renovation of newly-acquired homes; 
 HOA fees (as applicable), property taxes, insurance premiums, and the ongoing maintenance of our homes; 
 property management, general and administrative, and other entity-level commitments and expenses; 
 interest expense; 
 dividend payments to our stockholders; and 
 required contributions to our joint ventures. 
 We believe our rental income, net of total expenses, will generally provide cash flow sufficient to fund operations and dividend payments on a near-term basis. Additionally, we have guaranteed the funding of certain tax, insurance, and non-conforming property reserves related to the financing of one of our joint ventures. We do not expect these guarantees to have a material current or future effect on our liquidity. See Part I. Item 1. Financial Statements Note 5 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures. 
 58 

Overall macroeconomic conditions, including inflation, bank failures, and high interest rates, may negatively impact our operating cash flow such that we are unable to make required debt service payments, which would result in an event of default for any debt instrument under whose loan agreement such payments were not made. Specifically, the collateral within individual borrower entities may underperform, resulting in cash flow shortfalls for debt service while consolidated cash flows are sufficient to fund our operations. If an event of default occurs for a specific mortgage loan or for our secured term loan, our loan agreements provide certain remedies, including our ability to fund shortfalls from consolidated cash flow; and such an event of default would not result in an immediate acceleration of the loan. 
 Our real estate assets are illiquid in nature. A timely liquidation of assets may not be a viable source of short-term liquidity should a cash flow shortfall arise, and we may need to source liquidity from other financing sources, such as the Revolving Facility which had an undrawn balance of 1,000.0 million as of September 30, 2024. 
 Our long-term liquidity requirements consist primarily of funds necessary to pay for the acquisition of, and non-recurring capital expenditures for, our homes, and principal and interest payments of our indebtedness. We intend to satisfy our long-term liquidity needs through cash provided by operations, long-term secured and unsecured borrowings, the issuance of debt and equity securities, and property dispositions. As a REIT, we are required to distribute to our stockholders at least 90 of our taxable income, excluding net capital gain, on an annual basis. Therefore, as a general matter, it is unlikely that we will be able to retain substantial cash balances from our annual taxable income that could be used to meet our liquidity needs. Instead, we will need to meet these needs from external sources of capital and amounts, if any, by which our cash flow generated from operations exceeds taxable income. 
 
 Cash Flows 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 The following table summarizes our cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: 
 For the Nine Months Ended September 30, 
 in thousands) 2024 2023 Change Change Net cash provided by operating activities 948,997 1,019,544 (70,547) (6.9) Net cash used in investing activities (492,697) (769,596) 276,899 36.0 Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities (108,312) 276,016 (384,328) (139.2) Change in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash 347,988 525,964 (177,976) (33.8) 
 Operating Activities 
 Our cash flows provided by operating activities depend on numerous factors, including the occupancy level of our homes, the rental rates achieved on our leases, the collection of rent from our residents, and the amount of our operating and other expenses. Net cash provided by operating activities was 949.0 million and 1,019.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively , a decrease of 6.9 . The decrease in cash provided by operating activities is primarily due to settlement costs of 77.0 million included in net income that resolved an inquiry from the FTC and the legal dispute entitled City of San Diego et al v. Invitation Homes, Inc., inclusive of associated costs. 
 Investing Activities 
 Net cash used in investing activities consists primarily of the acquisition costs of homes, capital improvements, proceeds from property sales, and investments in unconsolidated joint ventures. Net cash used in investing activities was 492.7 million and 769.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, a decrease of 276.9 million. The decrease in net cash used in investing activities resulted primarily from the combined effect of the following significant changes in cash flows during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023: (1) a decrease in cash used for the acquisition of homes; (2) a decrease in cash proceeds received from the sale of single-family homes; (3) an increase in cash used for investments in joint ventures ; and (4) a decrease in cash used for investments in equity securities. Acquisition spen d decreased by 363.8 million from period to period due to a decrease in the number of homes acquired from 2,626 during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 1,591 homes acquired during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Proceeds from the sale of single-family homes decreased 48.6 million due to a decrease in the number of homes sold from 1,042 during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 
 59 

937 homes sold during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Cash invested in joint ventures increased 39.1 million from period to period as a result of the formation of a new joint venture during 2024. Cash invested in equity securities decreased 29.2 million due to fewer such investments during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Financing Activities 
 Net cash used in financing activities was 108.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to net cash provided by financing activities of 276.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The change between periods is primarily due to the following financing transactions. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we issued 494.3 million of unsecured notes, net of discount, and refinanced the 2020 Credit Facility. The proceeds were used to repay the existing credit facility, fund 54.3 million of financing costs, and increase cash reserves for general corporate purposes. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we issued 790.1 million of unsecured notes, net of discount, and used the proceeds to fund 7.7 million of financing costs and increase cash reserves for general corporate purposes . W e also made dividend and distribution payments totaling 518.8 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 480.7 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, which were funded by cash flows from operations.

Supplemental Guarantor Information 
 In March 2020, the SEC adopted amendments to Rule 3-10 of Regulation S-X and created Rule 13-01 to simplify disclosure requirements related to certain registered securities. The amendments became effective on January 4, 2021. INVH, INVH LP, the General Partner, and IH Merger Sub, LLC IH Merger Sub have filed a registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC registering, among other securities, debt securities of INVH LP, fully and unconditionally guaranteed, on a joint and several basis, by INVH, the General Partner, and/or IH Merger Sub. As a result of the amendments to Rule 3-10 of Regulation S-X, subsidiary issuers of obligations guaranteed by the parent are not required to provide separate financial statements, provided that the subsidiary obligor is consolidated into the parent company s consolidated financial statements, the parent guarantee is full and unconditional and, subject to certain exceptions as set forth below, the alternative disclosure required by Rule 13-01 is provided, which includes narrative disclosure and summarized financial information. Accordingly, separate consolidated financial statements of INVH LP, the General Partner, and IH Merger Sub have not been presented. 
 Furthermore, as permitted under Rule 13-01(a)(4)(vi) of Regulation S-X, we have excluded the summarized financial information for the INVH LP, the General Partner, and IH Merger Sub, because the combined assets, liabilities, and results of operations of INVH, INVH LP, the General Partner, and IH Merger Sub are not materially different than the corresponding amounts in our condensed consolidated financial statements, and management believes such summarized financial information would be repetitive and would not provide incremental value to investors. 
 Purchase of Outstanding Debt Securities or Loans 
 As market conditions warrant, we may from time to time seek to purchase our outstanding debt or debt securities that we may issue in the future, in privately negotiated or open market transactions, by tender offer or otherwise. Subject to any applicable limitations contained in the agreements governing our indebtedness, any purchases made by us may be funded by the use of cash on our condensed consolidated balance sheet or the incurrence of new secured or unsecured debt, including borrowings under our Credit Facility. The amounts involved in any such purchase transactions, individually or in the aggregate, may be material. Any such purchases may be with respect to a substantial amount of a particular class or series of debt, with the attendant reduction in the trading liquidity of such class or series. In addition, any such purchases made at prices below the adjusted issue price (as defined for United States federal income tax purposes) may result in taxable cancellation of indebtedness income to us, which amounts may be material, and in related adverse tax consequences to us. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 Critical accounting policies are those accounting policies that management believes are important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and require management s most difficult, subjective, or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. We believe that our critical accounting policies pertain to our investments in single-family residential properties, including acquisition of real estate assets, related cost capitalization, provisions for impairment, and single-family residential properties held for sale. These critical policies and estimates are summarized in Part II. Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. There were no material changes to our critical accounting policies during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 For a discussion of recently adopted accounting standards, if any, see Part I. Item 1. Financial Statements Note 2 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 
 Segment Reporting 
 Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise for which discrete financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the Chief Operating Decision Maker CODM in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. Our CODM is the Chief Executive Officer. 
 Under the provisions of ASC 280, Segment Reporting , we have determined that we have one reportable segment related to acquiring, renovating, leasing, and operating single-family homes as rental properties. The CODM evaluates operating performance and allocates resources on a total portfolio basis. The CODM utilizes AFFO as the primary measure to evaluate performance of the total portfolio. 
 61 

Non-GAAP Measures 
 EBITDA, EBITDAre, and Adjusted EBITDAre 
 EBITDA, EBITDA re , and Adjusted EBITDA re are supplemental, non-GAAP measures often utilized to evaluate the performance of real estate companies. We define EBITDA as net income or loss computed in accordance with GAAP before the following items: interest expense; income tax expense; depreciation and amortization; and adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures. The National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts Nareit recommends as a best practice that REITs that report an EBITDA performance measure also report EBITDA re . Consistent with the Nareit definition, we define EBITDA re as EBITDA, further adjusted for the following: gain on sale of property, net of tax; impairment on depreciated real estate investments; and adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures. 
 Adjusted EBITDA re is defined as EBITDA re before the following items: share-based compensation expense; severance; casualty (gains) losses, net; (gains) losses on investments in equity securities, net; and other income and expenses. EBITDA, EBITDA re , and Adjusted EBITDA re are used as supplemental financial performance measures by management and by external users of our financial statements, such as investors and commercial banks. Set forth below is additional detail on how management uses EBITDA, EBITDA re , and Adjusted EBITDA re as measures of performance. 
 Our management uses EBITDA, EBITDA re , and Adjusted EBITDA re in a number of ways to assess our condensed consolidated financial and operating performance, and we believe these measures are helpful to management and external users in identifying trends in our performance. EBITDA, EBITDA re , and Adjusted EBITDA re help management identify controllable expenses and make decisions designed to help us meet our current financial goals and optimize our financial performance, while neutralizing the impact of capital structure on results. Accordingly, we believe these metrics measure our financial performance based on operational factors that management can impact in the short-term, namely our cost structure and expenses. 
 We believe that the presentation of EBITDA, EBITDA re , and Adjusted EBITDA re provides information useful to investors in assessing our financial condition and results of operations. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to EBITDA, EBITDA re , and Adjusted EBITDA re is net income or loss. EBITDA, EBITDA re , and Adjusted EBITDA re are not used as measures of our liquidity and should not be considered alternatives to net income or loss or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with GAAP. Our EBITDA, EBITDA re , and Adjusted EBITDA re may not be comparable to the EBITDA, EBITDA re , and Adjusted EBITDA re of other companies due to the fact that not all companies use the same definitions of EBITDA, EBITDA re , and Adjusted EBITDA re . Accordingly, there can be no assurance that our basis for computing these non-GAAP measures is comparable with that of other companies.

 Net Operating Income 
 NOI is a non-GAAP measure often used to evaluate the performance of real estate companies. We define NOI for an identified population of homes as rental revenues and other property income less property operating and maintenance expense (which consists primarily of property taxes, insurance, HOA fees (when applicable), market-level personnel expenses, utility expenses, repairs and maintenance, and property administration). NOI excludes: interest expense; depreciation and amortization; property management expense; general and administrative expense; casualty losses, impairment, and other; gain on sale of property, net of tax; (gains) losses on investments in equity securities, net; other income and expenses; management fee revenues; and income (loss) from investments in unconsolidated joint ventures. 
 We consider NOI to be a meaningful supplemental financial measure of our performance when considered with the financial statements determined in accordance with GAAP. We believe NOI is helpful to investors in understanding the core performance of our real estate operations. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to NOI is net income or loss. NOI is not used as a measure of liquidity and should not be considered as an alternative to net income or loss or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with GAAP. Our NOI may not be comparable to the NOI of other companies due to the fact that not all companies use the same definition of NOI. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that our basis for computing this non-GAAP measure is comparable with that of other companies. 
 We believe that Same Store NOI is also a meaningful supplemental measure of our operating performance for the same reasons as NOI and is further helpful to investors as it provides a more consistent measurement of our performance across reporting periods by reflecting NOI for homes in our Same Store portfolio.

Funds from Operations, Core Funds from Operations, and Adjusted Funds from Operations 
 Funds From Operations FFO ), Core FFO, and Adjusted FFO are supplemental, non-GAAP measures often utilized to evaluate the performance of real estate companies. FFO is defined by Nareit as net income or loss (computed in accordance with GAAP) excluding gains or losses from sales of previously depreciated real estate assets, plus depreciation, amortization and impairment of real estate assets, and adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures. 
 We believe that FFO is a meaningful supplemental measure of the operating performance of our business because historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with GAAP assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time, as reflected through depreciation and amortization. Because real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, management considers FFO an appropriate supplemental performance measure as it excludes historical cost depreciation and amortization, impairment on depreciated real estate investments, gains or losses related to sales of previously depreciated homes, as well non-controlling interests, from net income or loss (computed in accordance with GAAP). By excluding depreciation and amortization and gains or losses on sales of real estate, management uses FFO to measure returns on its investments in homes. However, because FFO excludes depreciation and amortization and captures neither the changes in the value of the homes that result from use or market conditions nor the level of capital expenditures to maintain the operating performance of the homes, all of which have real economic effect and could materially affect our results from operations, the utility of FFO as a measure of our performance is limited. 
 Management also believes that FFO, combined with the required GAAP presentations, is useful to investors in providing more meaningful comparisons of the operating performance of a company s real estate between periods or as compared to other companies. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to FFO is net income or loss. FFO is not used as a measure of our liquidity and should not be considered an alternative to net income or loss or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with GAAP. Our FFO may not be comparable to the FFO of other companies due to the fact that not all companies use the same definition of FFO. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that our basis for computing this non-GAAP measures is comparable with that of other companies. 
 We believe that Core FFO and Adjusted FFO are also meaningful supplemental measures of our operating performance for the same reasons as FFO and are further helpful to investors as they provide a more consistent measurement of our performance across reporting periods by removing the impact of certain items that are not comparable from period to period. We define Core FFO as FFO adjusted for the following: non-cash interest expense related to amortization of deferred financing costs, loan discounts, and non-cash interest expense from derivatives; share-based compensation expense; legal settlements; severance expense; casualty (gains) losses, net; and (gains) losses on investments in equity and other securities, net, as applicable. We define Adjusted FFO as Core FFO less recurring capital expenditures, including adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures, that are necessary to help preserve the value, and maintain the functionality, of our homes. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to Core FFO and Adjusted FFO is net income or loss. Core FFO and Adjusted FFO are not used as measures of our liquidity and should not be considered alternatives to net income or loss or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with GAAP. Our Core FFO and Adjusted FFO may not be comparable to the Core FFO and Adjusted FFO of other companies due to the fact that not all companies use the same definition of Core FFO and Adjusted FFO. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that our basis for computing this non-GAAP measures is comparable with that of other companies.

For the computations of FFO, Core FFO, and AFFO per common share diluted, common share equivalents of 1,259,328 and 1,829,337 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 1,533,792 and 1,535,182 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, related to incremental shares attributed to non-vested share-based awards are included in the denominator. 
 (6) Vested units of partnership interests in INVH LP OP Units have been excluded from the computation of net income per common share diluted for the periods above because all net income attributable to the vested OP Units has been recorded as non-controlling interest and thus excluded from net income available to common stockholders. Weighted average vested OP Units of 1,979,009 and 1,869,483 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 1,945,886 and 1,824,297 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, are included in the denominator for the computations of FFO, Core FFO, and AFFO per common share diluted. 

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 Our future income, cash flows, and fair values relevant to financial instruments are dependent upon prevalent market interest rates. Market risk refers to the risk of loss from adverse changes in interest rates, seasonality, market prices, commodity prices, and inflation. The primary market risks to which we are exposed are interest rate risk and seasonality. We may in the future use derivative financial instruments to manage, or hedge, interest rate risks related to any borrowings we may have. We may enter into such contracts only with major financial institutions based on their credit ratings and other factors. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 A primary market risk to which we believe we are exposed is interest rate risk, which may result from many factors, including government monetary and tax policies, unfavorable global and United States economic conditions (including inflation, high interest rates, and bank failures), geopolitical tensions, and other factors that are beyond our control. We may incur additional variable rate debt in the future, including additional amounts that we may borrow under the Credit Facility. In addition, decreases in interest rates may lead to additional competition for the acquisition of single-family homes, which may lead to future acquisitions being more costly and resulting in lower yields on single-family homes targeted for acquisition. Significant increases in interest rates may also have an adverse impact on our earnings if we are unable to increase rents on expired leases or acquire single-family homes with rental rates high enough to offset the increase in interest rates on our borrowings. 
 As of September 30, 2024, our 3,855.2 million of outstanding variable-rate debt was comprised of borrowings on our mortgage loans of 630.2 million, Revolving Facility of 750.0 million, and Term Loan Facilities of 2,475.0 million. As of September 30, 2024, we had effectively converted 99.1 of these borrowings to a fixed rate through interest rate swap agreements. Our variable-rate borrowings bear interest at SOFR, as adjusted if appropriate, plus the applicable spread. Assuming no change in the outstanding balance of our existing debt, the projected effect of a 100 bps increase or decrease in SOFR, collectively, on our annual interest expense would be an estimated increase or decrease of 0.4 million. This estimate considers the impact of our interest rate swap agreements, interest rate cap agreement, and any Term SOFR floors or minimum interest rates stated in the agreements of the respective borrowings. 
 This analysis does not consider the effects of the reduced level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment. Further, in the event of a change of such magnitude, we may consider taking actions to further mitigate our exposure to the change. However, because of the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects, the sensitivity analysis assumes no changes in our capital structure. 
 Inflation 
 Inflation primarily impacts our results of operations as a result of increased repair and maintenance and other costs and wage pressures. Inflation could also impact our cost of capital as a result of changing interest rates on variable rate debt that is not hedged or if our debt instruments are refinanced in a high-inflation environment. Our resident leases typically have a 
 67 

PART II 

 term of one to two years, which generally enables us to compensate for inflationary effects by increasing rents on our homes to current market rates. Although an extreme or sustained escalation in costs could have a negative impact on our residents and their ability to absorb rent increases, we do not believe this had a material impact on our results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Seasonality 
 Our business and related operating results have been, and we believe will continue to be, impacted by seasonal factors throughout the year. In particular, we have experienced higher levels of resident move-outs during the summer months, which impacts both our rental revenues and related turnover costs. Further, our property operating costs are seasonally impacted in certain markets by increases in expenses such as HVAC repairs and costs to re-resident during the summer season. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 We maintain a set of disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. The design of any disclosure controls and procedures is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its goals under all potential future conditions. Any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to accomplish their objectives at the reasonable assurance level. 
 Changes in Internal Control 
 There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during our most recent fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
