million, cash and cash equivalents of approximately
 million,
shareholders equity of approximately 
 million and an accumulated deficit of approximately 
 million. Based on our current expectations of
our cash flow shortfall for the next 12 months, our working capital would support our activities for at least the next 12 months from
the issuance of these condensed consolidated financial statements. 

In
the event that we are unable to generate sufficient cash from our operating activities or raise additional funds, we may be required
to delay, reduce or severely curtail our operations or otherwise impede our on-going business efforts, which could have a material adverse
effect on our business, operating results, financial condition and long-term prospects. The Company may seek to obtain additional funding
through future equity issuances. There can be no assurance as to the availability or terms upon which such financing and capital might
be available. The eventual success of the Company and generation of positive cash flow will be dependent upon the commercialization of
products using the Company s technology by the Company s licensees and payments of continuing royalties on account thereof. 

The
Technical Support and New Improvements performance obligations are co-terminus over the term of the license agreement. For purposes of
determining the transaction price, and recognizing revenue, the Company combined the Technical Support and New Improvements performance
obligations because they have the same pattern of transfer and the same term. We maintain a staff of scientists and other professionals
whose primary job responsibilities throughout the year are: (i) being available to respond to Technical Support needs of our licensees,
and (ii) developing improvements to our technology which are offered to our licensees as New Improvements. Since the costs incurred to
satisfy the Technical Support and New Improvements performance obligations are incurred evenly throughout the year, the value of the
Technical Support and New Improvements services are recognized throughout the initial contract period as these performance obligations
are satisfied. If the agreement is not terminated at the end of the initial contract period, it will automatically renew on the same
terms as the initial contract for a one-year period. Consequently, any fees or minimum annual royalty obligations relating to this renewal
contract will be allocated similarly to the initial contract over the additional one-year period. 

We
recognize revenue when or as the performance obligations in the contract are satisfied. For performance obligations that are fulfilled
at a point in time, revenue is recognized at the fulfillment of the performance obligation. Since the IP is determined to be a functional
license, the value of the Grant of Use is recognized in the first period of the contract term in which the license agreement is in force.
The value of the Technical Support and New Improvements obligations is allocated throughout the contract period based on the satisfaction
of its performance obligations. If the agreement is not terminated at the end of the contract period, it will renew on the same terms
as the original agreement for a one-year period. Consequently, any fees or minimum annual royalties MAR relating to this
renewal contract will be allocated similarly over that additional year. 

The
Company s license agreements have a variable royalty fee structure (meaning that royalties are a fixed percentage of sales that
vary from period to period) and frequently include a minimum annual royalty commitment. In instances when sales of licensed products
by its licensees exceed the MAR, the Company recognizes fee income as the amounts have been earned. Typically, the royalty rate for such
sales is - of the selling price. While this is variable consideration, it is subject to the sales/usage royalty exception to recognition
of variable consideration in ASC 606 10-55-65 and therefore is not recognized until the subsequent sales or usage occurs or the MAR period
commences. 

Because
of the immediate recognition of the Grant of Use performance obligation: (i) the first period of the contract term will generally have
a higher percent allocation of the transaction price under ASC 606 than under the accounting guidance used prior to the adoption of ASC
606, and (ii) the remaining periods in the year will have less of the transaction price recognized under ASC 606 than under the accounting
guidance used prior to the adoption of ASC 606. After the initial period in the contract term, the revenue for the remaining periods
will be based on the satisfaction of the Technical Support and New Improvements obligations. Since most of our license agreements start
as of January 1st, the revenue recognized for the contract under ASC 606 in our first quarter will tend to be higher than the accounting
guidance used prior to the adoption of ASC 606. 

As
of September 30, 2024, the Company had in unbilled revenue included in royalty receivables. 

Certain
of the contract fees are accrued by, or paid to, the Company in advance of the period in which they are earned resulting in deferred
revenue (contract liabilities). Such excess amounts are recorded as deferred revenue and are recognized as revenue in future periods
as earned. Contract assets represent unbilled receivables and are presented within accounts receivable, net on the condensed consolidated
balance sheets. 

The
Company operates in a single business segment which is engaged in the development and marketing of technology and devices to control
the flow of light. Our revenue source comes from the licensing of this technology and all of these license agreements have similar terms
and provisions. The majority of the Company s licensing fee income comes from the activities of several licensees participating
in the automotive market. The Company currently believes that the automotive market will be the largest source of its royalty income
over the next several years. The Company s royalty income from this market may be influenced by numerous factors including various
trends affecting demand in the automotive industry and the rate of introduction of new technology in OEM product lines. In addition to
these macro factors, the Company s royalty income from the automotive market could also be influenced by specific factors such
as whether the Company s SPD-SmartGlass technology appears as standard equipment or as an option on a particular vehicle, the number
of additional vehicle models that SPD-SmartGlass appears on, the size of each window on a vehicle and the number of windows on a vehicle
that use SPD-SmartGlass, fluctuations in the total number of vehicles produced by a manufacturer, and in the percentage of cars within
each model produced with SPD-SmartGlass, and changes in pricing or exchange rates. 

As
of September 30, 2024, the Company has one license agreement that is in its initial multi-year term Initial Term with
continuing performance obligations going forward. The Initial Term of this agreement will end as of December 31, 2024. The Company currently
expects this agreement will renew annually at the end of the Initial Term. As of September 30, 2024, the aggregate amount of the revenue
to be recognized upon the satisfaction of the remaining performance obligations for this license agreement is . The revenue for
the remaining performance obligations for this license agreement is expected to be recognized evenly throughout the remaining period
of the Initial Term.

shares were issued to the investors in a private placement and, along with the shares issued in connection with the exercise of any warrants
in the future, are not registered and therefore subject to at least a six-month holding period by the investor from the date of issuance.
As of September 30, 2022, the Company received under these subscription agreements and issued common shares and
issued warrants. In addition, the Company has an outstanding commitment from a potential investor for the remaining 
under these subscription agreements. The Company did not sell any other equity securities during the periods ended September 30, 2024

Operating leases are included in right-of-use lease assets, other current liabilities and long-term lease liabilities on the condensed
consolidated balance sheets. Right-of-use lease assets and liabilities are recognized at each lease s commencement date based on
the present value of its lease payments over its respective lease term. The Company does not have an established incremental borrowing
rate as it does not have any debt. The Company uses the stated borrowing rate for a lease when readily determinable. When the interest
rates implicit in its lease agreements are not readily determinable, the Company used an interest rate based on the marketplace for public
debt. The weighted average discount rate associated with operating leases as of September 30, 2024 is .

Item
2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

Critical
Accounting Policies 

The
following accounting policies are important to understanding our financial condition and results of operations and should be read as
an integral part of the discussion and analysis of the results of our operations and financial position. For additional accounting policies,
see Note 2 to our December 31, 2023 consolidated financial statements, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. 

The
Company recognizes revenue in accordance with ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers . The Company determined that its
license agreements provide for three performance obligations: (i) Grant of Use, (ii) Technical Support, and (iii) New Improvements. 

The
best method for determining standalone selling price of our Grant of Use performance obligation is through a comparison of the average
royalty rate for comparable license agreements as compared to our license agreements. Based on the royalty rate comparison referred to
above, any pricing above and beyond the average royalty rate would relate to the Technical Support and New Improvements performance obligations. 

We
recognize revenue when or as the performance obligations in the contract are satisfied. For performance obligations that are fulfilled
at a point in time, revenue is recognized at the fulfillment of the performance obligation. Since the IP is determined to be a functional
license, the value of the Grant of Use is recognized in the first period of the contract term in which the license agreement is in force.
Since the costs incurred to satisfy the Technical Support and New Improvements performance obligations are incurred evenly throughout
the year, the value of the Technical Support and New Improvements services are recognized throughout the contract period as these performance
obligations are satisfied. 

The
Company operates in a single business segment which is engaged in the development and marketing of technology and devices to control
the flow of light. Our revenue source comes from the licensing of this technology and all of these license agreements have similar terms
and provisions. 

The
Company has entered into license agreements covering products using the Company s SPD technology. When royalties from the sales
of licensed products by a licensee exceed its contractual minimum annual royalties, the excess amount is recognized by the Company as
fee income in the period that it was earned. Certain of the fees are accrued by, or paid to, the Company in advance of the period in
which they are earned, resulting in deferred revenue. 

Royalty
receivables are stated less allowance for credit loss. The allowance represents estimated uncollectible receivables usually due to licensees 
potential insolvency. The allowance includes amounts for certain licensees where risk of default has been specifically identified. The
Company evaluates the collectability of its receivables on at least a quarterly basis and records appropriate allowances for uncollectible
accounts when necessary. 

12 

On
occasion, the Company may issue to consultants either options or warrants to purchase shares of common stock of the Company at specified
share prices. These options or warrants may vest based upon specific services being performed or performance criteria being met. In accounting
for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring, or in conjunction with selling, goods or services, the
Company is required to record consulting expenses based upon the fair value of such options or warrants on the earlier of the service
period or the period that such options or warrants vest as determined using a Black-Scholes option pricing model and are marked to market
quarterly using the Black-Scholes option valuation model. 

The
preparation of condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the condensed consolidated
financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from these
estimates. 

Results
of Operations 

Overview 

The
majority of the Company s fee income comes from the activities of several licensees participating in the automotive market. The
Company currently believes that the automotive market will be the largest source of its royalty income over the next several years. The
Company s royalty income from this market may be influenced by numerous factors including various trends affecting demand in the
automotive industry and the rate of introduction of new technology in OEM product lines. In addition to these macro factors, the Company s
royalty income from the automotive market could also be influenced by specific factors such as whether the Company s SPD-SmartGlass
technology appears as standard equipment or as an option on a particular vehicle, the number of additional vehicle models that SPD-SmartGlass
appears on, the size of each window on a vehicle and the number of windows on a vehicle that use SPD-SmartGlass, fluctuations in the
total number of vehicles produced by a manufacturer, and in the percentage of cars within model produced with SPD-SmartGlass, and changes
in pricing or exchange rates. 

Certain
license fees, which are paid to the Company in advance of the accounting period in which they are earned resulting in the recognition
of deferred revenue for the current accounting period, will be recognized as fee income in future periods. Also, licensees offset some
or all of their royalty payments on sales of licensed products for a given period by applying these advance payments towards such earned
royalty payments. 

The
Company has received royalty revenues from sales of products using the Company s technology that were accretive to the Company s
royalty revenue. Production efficiencies are expected to continue and accelerate with the introduction of the higher vehicle production
volumes for various car models going forward, and the Company expects that lower pricing per square foot of the Company s technology
could expand the market opportunities, adoption rates, and revenues for its technology in automotive and non-automotive applications.
The Company expects to generate additional royalty income from the near-term introduction of additional new car and aircraft models from
other OEMs (original equipment manufacturers), continued growth of sales of products using the Company s technology for the marine
industry in yachts and other watercraft, in trains, in museums, and in larger architectural projects. 

Because
the Company s license agreements typically provide for the payment of royalties by a licensee on product sales within 45 days after
the end of the quarter in which a sale of a licensed product occurs (with some of the Company s more recent license agreements
providing for payments on a monthly basis), and because of the time period which typically will elapse between a customer order and the
sale of the licensed product and installation in a home, office building, automobile, aircraft, boat or any other product, there could
be a delay between when economic activity between a licensee and its customer occurs and when the Company gets paid its royalty resulting
from such activity. 

13 

Three
months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 

The
Company s fee income from licensing activities for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 354,408 as compared to
 164,146 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. This increase in fee income of 190,262 (116 was primarily the result of
higher royalties from the automotive and aircraft markets as compared to the third quarter of 2023. The Company expects revenue in
all market segments to increase further as new car models and other products using the Company s SPD-SmartGlass technology are
introduced into the market. 

Operating
expenses decreased by 87,769 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 to 454,866 from 542,635 for the three months ended September
30, 2023. This decrease is the result of lower credit loss expense 75,000), as well as lower marketing and investor relations costs 22,000), lower patent costs 21,000) and lower allocated insurance costs 5,000), partially offset by higher payroll and related
costs 30,000). 

Research
and development expenditures decreased by 4,073 to 131,246 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 135,319 for the three

Financial
Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources 

The Company has primarily utilized its cash, cash equivalents, and investments
generated from sales of our common stock, proceeds from the exercise of options and warrants, and royalty fees collected to fund its research
and development of SPD light valves, for marketing initiatives, and for other working capital purposes. The Company s working
capital and capital requirements depend upon numerous factors, including, but not limited to, the results of research and development
activities, competitive and technological developments, the timing and costs of patent filings, and the development of new licensees
and changes in the Company s relationship with existing licensees. The degree of dependence of the Company s working capital
requirements on each of the foregoing factors cannot be quantified; increased research and development activities and related costs would
increase such requirements; the addition of new licensees may provide additional working capital or working capital requirements, and
changes in relationships with existing licensees would have a favorable or negative impact depending upon the nature of such changes. 

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company s cash and cash equivalents balance decreased by 827,971 as a result of
cash used to fund operations of 835,899 partially offset by cash generated from the exercise options of 8,670. As of September 30,
2024, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of approximately 1.6 million, working capital of 2.7 million and total shareholders 
equity of 2.8 million. 

Our
quarterly projected cash flow shortfall, based on our current operations, adjusted for any non-recurring cash expenses for the next 12
months and adjusted for additional royalties expected to be received for use of our products in new production, for the next 12 months,
is approximately 200,000 to 250,000 per quarter. We may eliminate some operating expenses in the future, which will further reduce
our cash flow shortfall if needed. Based on these assumptions, we currently expect to have sufficient working capital for more than the
next five years of operations. 

The
Company expects to use its cash to fund its research and development of SPD light valves, its expanded marketing initiatives, and for
other working capital purposes. The Company believes that its current cash and cash equivalents would fund its operations for more than
the next five years. There can be no assurances that expenditures will not exceed the anticipated amounts or that additional financing,
if required, will be available when needed or, if available, that its terms will be favorable or acceptable to the Company. Eventual
success of the Company and generation of positive cash flow will be dependent upon the extent of commercialization of products using
the Company s technology by the Company s licensees and payments of continuing royalties on account thereof. To date, the
Company has not generated sufficient revenue from its licensees to fully fund its operations.

Item
4. Controls and Procedures 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
