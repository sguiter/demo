and marketable securities of , which does not include the gross proceeds of approximately million from the October 2024 Offering. See Note 14, Subsequent Event . The Company has incurred recurring losses and at September 30, 2024, had an accumulated deficit of . The future success of the Company is dependent on its ability to successfully obtain additional working capital, obtain regulatory approval for and successfully launch and commercialize its product candidates and to ultimately attain profitable operations. The Company is subject to a variety of risks similar to other early-stage life science companies including, but not limited to, the successful development, regulatory approval, and market acceptance of the Company s product candidates, development by its competitors of new technological innovations, protection of proprietary technology, and raising additional working capital. The Company has incurred significant research and development expenses, general and administrative expenses related to its product candidate programs and negative cash flows from operations. The Company anticipates costs and expenses to increase in the future as the Company continues to develop its product candidates. The Company may seek to fund its operations, particularly with respect to its neurodegenerative disease programs, through additional public equity, private equity, or debt financings, as well as other sources. However, the Company may be unable to raise additional working capital, or if it is able to raise additional capital, it may be unable to do so on commercially favorable terms. The Company s failure to raise capital or enter into such other arrangements if and when needed would have a negative impact on the Company s business, results of operations and financial condition and the Company s ability to continue to develop its product candidates. The Company estimates that its cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities at September 30, 2024, including the 110 million of gross proceeds from the October 2024 Offering, is sufficient to fund its normal operations for at least the next twelve months. The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the ordinary course of business. The condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might result from the outcome of the uncertainties described above.

Fair Value Measurement The Company has certain financial assets and liabilities recorded at fair value which have been classified as Level 1, 2 or 3 within the fair value hierarchy as described in the accounting standards for fair value measurements. Level 1 Fair values are determined utilizing quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access; Level 2 Fair values are determined by utilizing quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in active markets or other market observable inputs such as interest rates, yield curves and foreign currency spot rates; and Level 3 Inputs are unobservable inputs that reflect the Company s own assumptions about the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. Financial assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The Company s financial assets and financial liabilities, which include cash equivalents and marketable securities and accounts payable, have been initially valued at the transaction price, and subsequently revalued at the end of each reporting period, utilizing third-party pricing services. The pricing services utilize industry standard valuation models, including both income and market-based approaches, to determine value.

Under the terms of the ATM Agreement with the Agent (the "ATM Agreement"), the Agent may sell the Shares at market prices by any method that is deemed to be an ATM as defined in Rule 415 under the Securities Act, as amended.

The holders of common stock are also entitled to receive dividends whenever funds are legally available and when declared by the board of directors, subject to the prior rights of holders of all classes of stock outstanding. As of September 30, 2024, a total of shares of common stock were reserved for issuance upon the exercise of outstanding stock options and warrants under the 2020 Equity Incentive Plan (the "2020 Plan"). Share Issuances Subject to the terms and conditions of the ATM Agreement, the Agent will use its commercially reasonable efforts to sell the Shares from time to time, based upon the Company s instructions. The Company has no obligation to sell any of the Shares and may at any time suspend sales under the ATM Agreement or terminate the ATM Agreement in accordance with its terms. The Company has provided the Agent with customary indemnification rights, and the Agent will be entitled to a fixed commission of of the aggregate gross proceeds from the Shares sold. The ATM Agreement contains customary representations and warranties, and the Company is required to deliver customary closing documents and certificates in connection with sales of the Shares .

All of the warrants in the May 2024 Offering were issued to a single investor. During the third quarter 2024, the investor exercised Pre-Funded Common Warrants and exercised the remaining Pre-Funded Common Warrants as of the date of this report. The Company received net proceeds from the May 2024 Offering of approximately million. On May 20, 2024, the Company also entered into a warrant inducement agreement with the same investor to exercise certain outstanding warrants that the Company issued in January 2023 ("January 2023 Existing Warrants"). Pursuant to the warrant inducement agreement, the investor agreed to exercise outstanding warrants to purchase an aggregate of shares of the Company's common stock at an amended exercise price of per share. These shares are held in abeyance and not considered outstanding. The shares held in abeyance will be held in abeyance until notice from the investor that the balance, or portion thereof, may be issued in compliance with a beneficial ownership limitation provision in the warrants. The Company also agreed to reduce the exercise price of the remaining unexercised portion of such warrants to purchase shares of common stock to per share and to issue the investor Series C Common Warrants to purchase shares of the Company's common stock and Series D Common Warrants to purchase shares of the Company's common stock ("January 2023 New Warrants"). Each will have an exercise price of per share and will be exercisable beginning on the effective date of stockholder approval. The Series C Common Warrants will expire on the one-year anniversary from the date of stockholder approval and the Series D Common Warrants will expire on the five-year anniversary from the date of stockholder approval. The shares held in abeyance were issued to the investor on October 9, 2024. The repricing of the January 2023 Existing Warrants and issuance of the Series C Common Warrants and the Series D Common Warrants is considered a modification of the January 2023 Existing Warrants under the guidance of ASU 2021-04. The modification is consistent with the "Equity Issuance" classification under that guidance as the reason for the modification was to induce the holder to cash exercise their warrants, resulting in the imminent exercise of the January 2023 Existing Warrants, which raised equity capital and generated net proceeds for the Company of approximately million. The total fair value of the consideration of the modification includes the incremental fair value of the January 2023 Existing Warrants (determined by comparing the fair values immediately prior to and immediately after the modification) and the initial fair value of the January 2023 New Warrants. The fair values were calculated using the Black-Scholes model and the Company determined that the total fair value of the consideration related to the modification of the January 2023 Existing Warrants, including the initial fair value of the January 2023 New Warrants was million.

Forward-looking statements can generally be identified by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts and include, but are not limited to, statements using terminology such as can , may , could , should , assume , forecasts , believe , designed to , will , expect , plan , anticipate , estimate , potential , position , predicts , strategy , guidance , intend , seek , budget , project or continue , or the negative thereof or other comparable terminology regarding beliefs, plans, expectations or intentions regarding the future. You should read statements that contain these words carefully because they: 
 discuss our future expectations; 

contain projections of our clinical trials, future results of operations or of our financial condition; and 

state other forward-looking information. 

We believe it is important to communicate our expectations. However, forward-looking statements are based on our current expectations, assumptions, estimates, approximations and projections about our business and our industry and management s beliefs, all of which are subject to change. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors. Accordingly, our actual results and the timing of certain events may differ materially and adversely from those expressed or implied in such forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors and risks, including, but not limited to, those set forth in this Item 2, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and in our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in this Report, those set forth from time to time in our other filings with the SEC, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, and the following factors and risks: 
 We are a clinical-stage drug development company with limited resources, a limited operating history and have no products approved for commercial sale, which may make it difficult to evaluate our current business and predict our future success and viability; 

If we are unable to successfully raise additional capital, particularly with respect to our neurodegenerative programs, our future clinical trials and product development could be limited and our long-term viability may be threatened; 

While the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, lifted the clinical holds with respect to the risvodetinib (IkT-148009) programs relating to Parkinson s disease and Multiple System Atrophy, or MSA, we may be subject to further clinical holds by the FDA in the future; 

IkT-001Pro may not improve the side effect profile compared to imatinib mesylate or may not be effective as an add-on treatment for PAH; 

Drug development is a highly uncertain undertaking and involves a substantial degree of risk. We have never generated any revenue from product sales, we may never generate any revenue from product sales, and we may fail to generate further revenue from grants or contracts or to be profitable; 

The wars between Russia and Ukraine and between Israel and Hamas could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition; 

16 

Our results of operations have been adversely affected and, in the future, could be materially adversely impacted by the COVID-19 virus; 

Adverse developments affecting financial institutions, companies in the financial services industry or the financial services industry generally, including those we do business with, could adversely affect our operations and liquidity; 

We have incurred significant net losses since our inception and anticipate that we will continue to incur net losses for the foreseeable future; 

Due to the significant resources required for the development of our programs, and depending on our ability to access capital, we must prioritize development of certain product candidates; 

We currently contract with various research institutions to perform the research and development activities needed to develop our products, and if we ever choose to or need to find alternative research institutions, we may not be able to do so at all or, if we are able to do so, it may be costly and may cause significant delays in the development and commercialization of our products; 

Positive results from early preclinical or clinical studies of our product candidates are not necessarily predictive of the results of later preclinical studies and any current and future clinical trials of our product candidates; 

We have no history of completing clinical trials for novel drug substances or commercializing pharmaceutical products, which may make it difficult to evaluate the prospects for our future viability; 

Our clinical trials may reveal significant adverse events, toxicities or other side effects not seen in our preclinical studies and may result in a safety profile that could inhibit regulatory approval or market acceptance of any of our product candidates; 

We have concentrated much of our research and development efforts to date on the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, a field that has seen limited success in drug development, although we now intend to expend considerable resources on PAH; 

We may encounter substantial delays in our current and planned clinical trials, or may not be able to conduct or complete our clinical trials on the timelines we expect, if at all; 

Our current and planned clinical trials may fail to demonstrate substantial evidence of the safety and efficacy of our product candidates, which would prevent, delay or limit the scope of regulatory approval and commercialization; 

Clinical development is a lengthy and expensive process with an uncertain outcome, and failure can occur at any stage of clinical development; 

The manufacture of our product candidates is complex and difficulties may be encountered in production; 

If, in the future, we are unable to establish sales and marketing capabilities or enter into agreements with third parties to sell and market any product candidates we may develop, we may not be successful in commercializing those product candidates if and when they are approved; 

Even if any product candidates we develop receive marketing approval, they may fail to achieve the degree of market acceptance by physicians, patients, healthcare payors, and others in the medical community necessary for commercial success; 

Even if we are able to commercialize any product candidates, such products may become subject to unfavorable pricing regulations, third-party reimbursement practices, or healthcare reform initiatives, which would harm our business; 

The regulatory approval processes of the FDA, European Medicines Agency, and comparable foreign regulatory authorities are lengthy, time consuming, and inherently unpredictable. Regulatory authorities have substantial discretion in the approval process and may refuse to accept an application, may disagree with our regulatory strategy or proposed pathway for approval or may decide that our data are insufficient for approval and require additional preclinical, clinical or other studies; 

We expect to depend in whole or in part on collaborations with third parties for the research, development and commercialization of any product candidates we may develop; 

We contract with third parties for the manufacture of materials for our research programs, preclinical studies and current clinical trials and expect to continue to do so for any future clinical trials and for commercialization of any product candidates that we may develop; 

17 

We depend on a small number of third-party suppliers for key raw materials used in the manufacturing processes for our product candidates, and the loss of these third-party suppliers or their inability to supply us with adequate raw materials could harm our business; and 

If we are unable to obtain and maintain patent protection for any product candidates we develop, our competitors could develop and commercialize products or technology similar or identical to ours, and our ability to successfully commercialize any product candidates we may develop, and our technology may be adversely affected. 

Any or all of our forward-looking statements may turn out to be wrong. They may be affected by inaccurate assumptions that we might make or by known or unknown risks and uncertainties.

 Overview 
 We are a clinical-stage pharmaceutical company developing protein kinase inhibitor therapeutics to modify the course of cardiopulmonary and neurodegenerative diseases and other diseases that arise from aberrant signaling through the Abelson Tyrosine Kinases. The Company s multi-therapeutic pipeline has developed IkT-001Pro, a prodrug of the anticancer agent imatinib mesylate, for Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (PAH). In 2023, the Company completed a bioequivalence clinical trial in healthy volunteers to determine the dose of IkT-001Pro that is equivalent to either 400 mg or 600 mg imatinib mesylate and the results are being utilized to set the doses in a Phase 2b trial to determine if IkT-001Pro could be a disease-modifying treatment for PAH. The Company has also developed risvodetinib (also known as IkT-148009), a selective inhibitor of the non-receptor Abelson Tyrosine Kinases that targets the treatment of Parkinson s disease inside and outside the brain. In 2021, the Company commenced clinical development of risvodetinib. In 2023, the Company initiated the Phase 2 201 trial for risvodetinib (IkT-148009) as a treatment for Parkinson s disease and completed that trial on October 6, 2024. We expect results from this trial to be reported in the fourth quarter of 2024. 
 IkT-001 Pro and PAH . IkT-001Pro emerged from the Company s medicinal chemistry program that aimed to improve on-dosing side effects for drugs that inhibit the Abelson Tyrosine Kinase family. IkT-001Pro, a prodrug of the anticancer agent imatinib mesylate, was designed to mask areas of the molecule that might play a role in the on-dosing GI and other side effects commonly observed with oral imatinib mesylate. A three-part dose finding/dose equivalence study in 66 healthy volunteers (known as the 501 trial was completed with IkT-001Pro in 2023. The study was designed to evaluate the 96-hour single-dose pharmacokinetics of imatinib delivered as IkT-001Pro and determine the dose of IkT-001Pro that can deliver the equivalent of either 400 mg or 600 mg imatinib mesylate. Bioequivalence to 400 mg imatinib mesylate was established to our satisfaction for a 600 mg dose of IkT-001Pro. We further evaluated 600 mg imatinib mesylate and believe that a dose between 800 mg and 900 mg of IkT-001Pro is the preferred dose of IkT-001Pro to deliver a dose of imatinib equivalent to 600 mg imatinib mesylate. On January 19, 2024, members of the Company along with its medical consultants met with the FDA Hematological Malignancy Review Team (the Review Team in a Pre-New Drug Application, or pre-NDA, meeting to discuss our bioequivalence studies of IkT-001Pro and its path to approval. All questions were addressed and summarized in official meeting minutes issued by the FDA on February 12, 2024. During the meeting, we inquired whether additional clinical studies would be needed to seek approval and discussed manufacturing and quality control requirements for approval. The Review Team acknowledged that the 505(b)(2) pathway appeared to be the appropriate pathway for approval of IkT-001Pro and indicated that, pending formal review of our clinical data, clinical studies completed to date indicate that 
 18 

600 mg and 800 mg IkT-001Pro provide similar exposures to 400 mg and 600 mg imatinib mesylate, respectively. The Review Team also discussed the possible difference between IkT-001Pro and imatinib mesylate absorption in the gut and recommended that we evaluate whether IkT-001Pro and imatinib mesylate behave differently with respect to certain gut transporters that regulate absorption. This evaluation was completed and determined that IkT-001Pro and imatinib mesylate have similar behavior toward the transporters P-glycoprotein (PGP) and the Breast Cancer Resistance Protein BCRP. Finally, a number of recommendations were discussed to prevent the potential mix-up between IkT-001Pro and imatinib mesylate either at the pharmacy or by patients for two drugs delivering the same active ingredient. The Company discussed alternate dosage forms for IkT-001Pro relative to imatinib mesylate as the primary mitigation strategy and will provide a justification of the dosage forms chosen and why they are unlikely to cause medication errors if/when the Company submits an NDA for approval of IkT-001Pro in these cancer indications. 
 In 2013, the outcome of a Phase 3 trial evaluating imatinib mesylate as a treatment for PAH was reported, demonstrating that imatinib can modify the course of disease in PAH. Co-administration of medications with harmful drug-drug interactions precluded the approval of imatinib as add-on therapy in PAH despite the success of the Phase 3 trial. PAH is a rare disease of the pulmonary microvasculature, with about 30,000 cases in the U.S. that principally afflicts women between the ages of 30 and 60. The global PAH market size was valued at 7.66 billion in 2023 and is estimated to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5.4 between 2024 to 2030. As the Company considered revisiting the use of imatinib in PAH, the Company recognized that changes in standard-of-care for these patients may have alleviated much of the safety risk previously observed for imatinib in PAH patients. This analysis prompted the Company to file a pre-IND (PIND) meeting request to discuss the application of IkT-001Pro as a potential disease-modifying treatment for PAH. To evaluate this further, members of the Company met with the FDA Division of Cardiology and Nephrology in a PIND meeting to discuss the Company s plan to utilize IkT-001Pro at 300 mg or 500 mg in a Phase 2b efficacy, safety and tolerability study in PAH. At the meeting, the FDA confirmed that IkT-001Pro would be viewed as a New Molecular Entity (NME) and that the appropriate path for approval remained to be the 505(b)(2) statute. This opens up the possibility of IkT-001Pro being granted NME status and patent exclusivity on approval. The FDA requested at the PIND meeting that we conduct a comparative cell-culture based study of the hERG ion channel, a standard cardiovascular safety test performed for any NME for which a new IND is to be opened. Neither IkT-001Pro nor imatinib mesylate were found to be inhibitors of hERG. Following completion of this study, the IND was filed with the FDA on August 9, 2024 and cleared to initiate a Phase 2b trial on September 9, 2024. On October 21, 2024, the Company closed a private placement with an initial investment of approximately 110 million, before deducting placement fees and offering expenses, to support this program. If the warrants are exercised for cash, the aggregate financing may be up to 275 million. The Company intends to use the net proceeds from the private placement to finance the initiation of a Phase 2b trial in PAH and for general corporate purposes. The Company has also applied for Orphan Drug Designation for delivery of imatinib by IkT-001Pro for PAH. 
 Risvodetinib and neurodegenerative diseases . Risvodetinib emerged from the Company s RAMP TM medical chemistry program and was shown to be a selective inhibitor of the non-receptor Abelson Tyrosine Kinases. In a series of pre-clinical studies, including therapeutic dosing animal models of inherited and sporadic Parkinson s disease, risvodetinib was shown to be an effective, disease-modifying therapeutic. These studies established that risvodetinib is capable of protecting neurons from degradation, restoring lost motor and non-motor function, suppressing neuroinflammation and clearing the pathology arising from alpha-synuclein aggregate deposition in animal models of human disease. These studies prompted clinical development of risvodetinib in patients in untreated Parkinson s disease. The Phase 2 201 Trial was a twelve-week study of three doses of risvodetinib in participants who have untreated Parkinson s disease and was placebo controlled with 1:1:1:1 randomization. The primary endpoints of this trial were safety and tolerability and a secondary endpoint included a hierarchy of 15 endpoints whose purpose was to evaluate treatment benefit in the brain and GI tract. The 201 Trial was completed on October 6, 2024 and trial outcomes are anticipated to be made public in the fourth quarter of 2024. 
 In March 2023, we opened our IND to evaluate risvodetinib (IkT-148009) as a treatment for the Parkinson s-related orphan disease Multiple System Atrophy, or MSA. Our evaluation of risvodetinib (IkT-148009) in MSA was benefited by a grant received from the National Institute of Neurological Diseases and Stroke, an Institute of the National Institutes of Health, for 0.39 million to fund animal model studies of risvodetinib (IkT-148009) as a therapy for MSA. Two different animal studies were undertaken to evaluate whether risvodetinib (IkT-148009) could have an impact on disease in the animal. One model evaluated the ability of risvodetinib (IkT-148009) to modify disease early in its progression, while the second model is evaluating whether risvodetinib (IkT-148009) can correct functional loss much later in the disease course. The early progression model study has now been shown to preserve nearly normal functional activity following 20 weeks of once daily dosing relative to untreated controls. Preservation of function in this model occurred with substantial reduction of the underlying alpha-synuclein protein pathology. The second model evaluating risvodetinib (IkT-148009) late in the disease course is ongoing. In addition, risvodetinib (IkT-148009) was recently given Orphan Drug Designation by the FDA for the treatment of MSA. We are working with the National Institute of Neurological Diseases and Stroke to possibly initiate a Phase 2/3 program to evaluate risvodetinib (IkT-148009) as a treatment for MSA through a clinical trial network supported by the Institute. The proposed Phase 2/3 study will have a primary efficacy endpoint following once daily dosing at one of two dose levels for twelve months. We plan to submit complementary regulatory documents for risvodetinib (IkT-148009) to European Union authorities in 2024 or 2025. 
 19 

We have also improved drug delivery of risvodetinib (IkT-148009) through development of a tablet formulation, which we measured to nearly double the concentration of risvodetinib (IkT-148009) delivered relative to the same dose previously administered as a gelatin capsule. This provides the opportunity to lower the effective oral dose, which could lead to further safety and tolerability improvements for risvodetinib (IkT-148009). The Company plans to introduce the tablet formulation into the 12-month extension study, once implemented, as well as in all future clinical trials. 
 Finally, we are evaluating a number of research phase molecules (IkT-148x and BIP 4-7) for a variety of neurodegenerative disease indications across our pre-clinical development pipeline. A similar effort has begun to identify novel, second generation candidate molecules for PAH. 
 To increase the probability of success, we are making parallel investments in several product candidates and back-up candidates, and plan to advance only those candidates to the later stages of clinical development that show strong preclinical and early clinical data. By developing a portfolio of product candidates across therapeutic indications, we can continuously apply learnings and tools across programs and leverage economies of scale in our research and development organization. Our target indications include orphan indications, such as PAH and Multiple System Atrophy, and diseases with large patient populations, such as PD. 
 We currently have commercialization rights to all of our development programs and patent protection in the United States until 2033 for IkT-001Pro and 2036 for risvodetinib (IkT-148009). Additional patent filings could extend this period of exclusivity. 
 Components of Operating Results 
 Operating Expenses 
 Research and Development 
 Research and development activities account for a significant portion of our operating expenses. We record research and development expenses as incurred. Research and development expenses incurred by us for the discovery and development of our product candidates and prodrug technologies include: 
 external research and development expenses, including expenses incurred under arrangements with third parties, such as CROs, preclinical testing organizations, clinical testing organizations, CMOs, academic and non-profit institutions and consultants; 

fees related to our license and collaboration agreements; 

personnel related expenses, including salaries, benefits and non-cash stock-based compensation expense; and 

other expenses, which include direct and allocated expenses for laboratory, facilities and other costs. 

A portion of our research and development expenses are direct external expenses, which we track on a program-specific basis from inception of the program. 
 Program expenses include expenses associated with our most advanced product candidates and the discovery and development of compounds that are potential future candidates. We also track external expenses associated with our third-party research and development efforts. All external costs are tracked by therapeutic indication. We do not track personnel or other operating expenses incurred for our research and development programs on a program-specific basis. These expenses primarily relate to salaries and benefits and stock-based compensation and office consumables. 
 At this time, we can only estimate the nature, timing and costs of the efforts that will be necessary to complete the development of, and obtain regulatory approval for, any of our product candidates. We are also unable to predict when, if ever, material net cash inflows will commence from sales or licensing of our product candidates. This is due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with drug development, including the uncertainty of: 
 our ability to add and retain key research and development personnel and other key employees; 

our ability to successfully file IND and NDA applications with the FDA; 

our ability to conduct and commence trials; 

our ability to establish an appropriate safety profile with IND-enabling toxicology studies; 

our ability to successfully develop, obtain regulatory approval for, and then successfully commercialize, our product candidates; 

20 

our successful enrollment in and completion of our current and future clinical trials; 

the costs associated with the development of any additional product candidates we identify in-house or acquire through collaborations; 

our ability to discover, develop and utilize biomarkers to demonstrate target engagement, pathway engagement and the impact on disease progression of our molecules; 

our ability to establish agreements with third party manufacturers for clinical supply for any future clinical trials and commercial manufacturing, if our product candidates are approved; 

the terms and timing of any collaboration, license or other arrangement, including the terms and timing of any milestone payments thereunder; 

our ability to obtain and maintain patent, trade secret and other intellectual property protection and regulatory exclusivity for our product candidates if and when approved; 

our receipt of marketing approvals from applicable regulatory authorities; 

the impact of the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic or other future pandemics; 

our ability to commercialize products, if and when approved, whether alone or in collaboration with others; and 

the continued acceptable safety profiles of the product candidates following approval. 

A change in any of these variables with respect to the development of any of our product candidates would significantly change the costs, timing and viability associated with the development of that product candidate. We expect our research and development expenses to increase for the next several years as we continue to implement our business strategy, advance our current programs, expand our research and development efforts, seek regulatory approvals for any product candidates that successfully complete clinical trials, access and develop additional product candidates and incur expenses associated with hiring additional personnel to support our research and development efforts. In addition, product candidates in later stages of clinical development generally incur higher development costs than those in earlier stages of clinical development, primarily due to the increased size and duration of later-stage clinical trials. 
 Our direct research and development expenses consist principally of external costs, such as fees paid to investigators, consultants, central laboratories and CROs in connection with our clinical studies, and costs related to acquiring and manufacturing clinical study materials. We allocate salary and benefit costs directly related to specific programs. We do not allocate personnel-related discretionary bonus or stock-based compensation costs, laboratory and related expenses, depreciation or other indirect costs that are deployed across multiple projects under development and, as such, the costs are separately classified as other research and development expenses in the table below:

Selling, General and Administrative 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses include personnel related expenses, such as salaries, benefits, travel and non-cash stock-based compensation expense, expenses for outside professional services and allocated expenses. Outside professional services consist of legal, accounting and audit services, investor relations services and other consulting fees. Allocated expenses consist of rent expenses related to our offices in Lexington, Massachusetts and Atlanta, Georgia not otherwise included in research and development expenses. 
 We are incurring additional expenses as compared to when we were a private company, including expenses related to compliance with the rules and regulations of the SEC and those of Nasdaq, additional insurance expenses, investor relations activities and other administrative and professional services. We also are increasing our administrative headcount as a public company and as we advance our product candidates through clinical development, which will also likely require us to increase our selling, general and administrative expenses.

 Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by 14,709 or 0.9 to 1,637,603 from 1,622,894 in the prior comparable period. The 14,709 increase was primarily driven by a 273,000 decrease in advertising and promotion, an 80,000 decrease in D O insurance and a 338,000 net increase in all other normal selling, general and administrative expenses.

 Interest income decreased by 124,267 or 71.6 to 49,410 from 173,677 in the prior comparable period. The decrease was driven by a reduction in interest earned on U.S. Treasuries and money market instruments.

Grant Revenue 
 Grant revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, decreased by 260,500 or 100 to 0 from 260,500 in the prior comparable period. During 2024, the Company continued to advance its Phase I and Phase II clinical trials for PD which were not submitted for grant revenue. The Company has no active grants during the period ended September 30, 2024. 
 Research and Development 
 Research and development expenses decreased by 598,386 or 5.6 to 10,016,982 from 10,615,368 in the prior comparable period. The 0.6 million decrease in research and development expenses was due to a decrease of 2.1 million in CML expenses due to the completion of the three-part dose finding equivalence study in 2023 partially offset by an increase of 0.8 million in PAH expenses, a 0.9 million increase in risvodetinib (IkT-148009) expenses and a net decrease of 0.2 million in other research and development expenses. 
 Selling, General and Administrative 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by 312,028 or 5.9 to 5,643,386 from 5,331,358 in the prior comparable period. The 0.3 million increase was primarily driven by a 0.7 million increase in legal and consulting fees partially offset by a 0.2 million decrease in D O insurance, a 0.3 million decrease in advertising and promotions and a 0.1 million net increase in all other normal selling, general and administrative expenses. 
 Interest Income 
 Interest income decreased by 562,224 or 67.3 to 273,059 from 835,283 in the prior comparable period. The decrease was driven by a reduction in interest earned on U.S. Treasuries and money market instruments. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Sources of Liquidity 
 From our inception up until our December 2020 IPO, we funded our operations primarily through private, state and federal contracts and grants. In October 2024, the Company raised approximately 110 million in gross proceeds from its October 2024 Offering. 
 On February 1, 2024, the Company entered into an ATM with H.C. Wainwright Co., LLC as sales agent (the Agent ), pursuant to which the Company may, from time to time, issue and sell shares of its common stock, in an aggregate offering price of up to 5.7 million through the Agent. Under the terms of the ATM, the Agent may sell the shares of common stock at market prices by any method that is deemed to be an at the market offering as defined in Rule 415 under the Securities Act. On May 20, 2024, the Company reduced the aggregate offering price to 50,000, not including the shares of common stock previously sold. As of September 30, 2024, 315,338 Shares have been sold under the ATM Agreement with net proceeds of 820,509 to the Company. 
 As at September 30, 2024, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of 913,420 and marketable securities of 2,330,226 which does not include the gross proceeds of approximately 110 million from the October 2024 Offering. 
 The Company has incurred recurring losses and at September 30, 2024 had an accumulated deficit of 82,288,034. 
 23 

Future Funding Requirements 
 To date, we have not generated any revenue from the sale of commercial products. We do not expect to generate any significant revenue from product sales unless and until we obtain regulatory approval of and successfully commercialize any of our product candidates and we do not know when, or if, this will occur. We expect to continue to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future, and we expect the losses to increase as we continue the development of, and seek regulatory approvals for, our product candidates, and begin to commercialize any future approved products. We are subject to all of the risks typically related to the development of new product candidates, and we may encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, delays and other unknown factors that may adversely affect our business. We anticipate that we will need substantial additional funding in connection with our continuing operations. 
 Until we can generate a sufficient amount of revenue from the commercialization of our product candidates, if ever, we expect to finance our incremental cash needs through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings, working capital lines of credit, grant funding and potential licenses and collaboration agreements. Additional working capital may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to us, we may have to significantly delay, reduce or discontinue the development or commercialization of one or more of our product candidates. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of additional debt or equity securities, it could result in dilution to our existing stockholders, increased fixed payment obligations and the existence of securities with rights that may be senior to those of our common stock. If we incur indebtedness, we could become subject to covenants that would restrict our operations and potentially impair our competitiveness, such as limitations on our ability to incur additional debt, limitations on our ability to acquire, sell or license intellectual property rights and other operating restrictions that could adversely impact our ability to conduct our business. Additionally, any future collaborations we enter into with third parties may provide capital in the near term but limit our potential cash flow and revenue in the future. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Since our inception, we have incurred significant losses and negative cash flows from operations. We have an accumulated deficit of 82,288,034 at September 30, 2024. We expect to incur substantial additional losses in the future as we conduct and expand our research and development activities. 
 We may seek to fund our operations through public equity or private equity or debt financings, as well as other sources. However, we may be unable to raise additional working capital, or if we are able to raise additional working capital, we may be unable to do so on commercially favorable terms. Our failure to raise capital or enter into such other arrangements if and when needed would have a negative impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition and our ability to continue to develop our product candidates. 
 We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities as of September 30, 2024 and the gross proceeds of approximately 110 million the Company raised in October 2024, will enable us to fund our operating requirements for at least the next twelve months. However, we have based these estimates on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could deplete our working capital sooner than planned. 
 
 The timing and amount of our operating expenditures will depend largely on: 
 the timing and progress of preclinical and clinical development activities; 

the number and scope of preclinical and clinical programs we decide to pursue; 

possible delays or interruptions to preclinical studies, clinical trials, our receipt of services from our third-party service providers on whom we rely; 

the progress of the development efforts of third parties with whom we have entered into license and collaboration agreements; 

our ability to maintain our current research and development programs and to establish new research and development, license or collaboration arrangements; 

our ability and success in securing manufacturing relationships with third parties or, in the future, in establishing and operating a manufacturing facility; 

the costs involved in prosecuting, defending and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property claims; 

the cost and timing of regulatory approvals; 

24 

our efforts to enhance operational, financial and information management systems and hire additional personnel, including personnel to support development of our product candidates; and 

the costs and ongoing investments to in-license and/or acquire additional technologies. 

A change in the outcome of any of these or other variables with respect to the development of any of our product candidates could significantly change the costs and timing associated with the development of that product candidate. Furthermore, our operating plans may change in the future, and we may need additional funds to meet operational needs and capital requirements associated with such operating plans.

 25 

Contractual Obligations and Commitments 
 On April 18, 2022, the Company entered into an operating lease agreement through September 30, 2025 for its office space in Lexington, Massachusetts. The Lexington lease contains escalating payments during the lease period. Upon execution of this lease agreement, the Company prepaid one month of rent, applied to the first month's rent, and a security deposit, which will be held in escrow and credited at the termination of the lease. Our total lease obligation is 153,288, consisting of minimum annual rental obligations of 38,322 for fiscal year 2024 and 114,966 for fiscal year 2025. 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates 
 This discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or US GAAP. The preparation of these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, as well as the reported expenses incurred during the reporting periods. Our estimates are based on our historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. While our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in the notes to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Report, we believe that the following accounting policies are critical to understanding our historical and future performance, as these policies relate to the more significant areas involving management s judgments and estimates. 
 Research and Development Expenses 
 We record research and development expenses to operations as incurred. Research and development expenses represent costs incurred by us for the discovery and development of our product candidates and the development of our RAMP drug discovery program and prodrug technologies and include: employee-related expenses, such as salaries, benefits, travel and non-cash stock-based compensation expense; external research and development expenses incurred under arrangements with third parties, such as CROs, preclinical testing organizations, clinical testing organizations, CMOs, academic and non-profit institutions and consultants; costs to acquire technologies to be used in research and development that have not reached technological feasibility and have no alternative future use; license fees; and other expenses, which include direct and allocated expenses for laboratory, facilities and other costs. 
 As part of the process of preparing financial statements, we are required to estimate and accrue expenses. A portion of our research and development expenses is comprised of external costs, which we track on a program-specific basis. We record the estimated expenses of research and development activities conducted by third-party service providers as they are incurred and provided within research and development expense in the condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. These services include the conduct of clinical studies, preclinical studies and consulting services. These costs are a significant component of our research and development expenses. 
 Costs for research and development activities are recognized based on costs incurred. We make significant judgments and estimates in determining the accrued balance in each reporting period. As actual costs become known, we adjust our accrued estimates. Although we do not expect our estimates to be materially different from amounts actually incurred, our understanding of the status and timing of services performed may vary from our estimates and could result in us reporting amounts that are too high or too low in any particular period. Our accrued expenses are dependent, in part, upon the receipt of timely and accurate reporting from external clinical research organizations and other third-party service providers. Due to the nature of estimates, we cannot assure you that we will not make changes to our estimates in the future as we become aware of additional information about the status or conduct of our clinical trials and other research activities. 
 26 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitat ive Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 As a smaller reporting company, we are not required to provide disclosure regarding quantitative and qualitative market risk. 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15(b) and 15d-15(b) under the Exchange Act as of the end of the period covered by this Report. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. Any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objective and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at a reasonable assurance level as of September 30, 2024. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 During the quarter ended June 30, 2024, we previously disclosed a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting related to a certain non-routine transaction. To address this material weakness, we strengthened our internal controls to ensure all aspects of accounting treatment and disclosure are evaluated as part of non-routine accounting transactions. 
 As a result of the remediation activities taken and controls in place at September 30, 2024, we have remediated this previously disclosed material weakness. 
 Other than as described above, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting or in any other factors that could significantly affect these controls during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II OTHE R INFORMATION 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings. 
 As previously disclosed, on April 26, 2024, the Company received a notice of a demand for arbitration with the American Arbitration Association from Pivot Holding LLC Pivot ), a successor in interest to Sphaera Pharma Pte. Ltd. Sphaera ), in connection with the Collaborative Research and Development Agreement dated February 29, 2012, as amended, between the Company and Sphaera (the Collaboration Agreement ), alleging breach of contract by the Company for failure to pay certain milestone payments under the Collaboration Agreement and seeking damages. Also as previously disclosed, on June 17, 2024, the Company filed an answering statement and counterclaim denying that it had breached the Collaboration Agreement and counterclaiming. On September 30, 2024, following a non-binding confidential mediation, the Company and Pivot entered into a settlement agreement (the Settlement Agreement pursuant to which the Company agreed to pay to Pivot a total sum of 500,000, which Pivot agreed shall constitute full and complete payment for, and shall fully satisfy, any and all amounts for any and all project milestone payments owed or that may be owed to Sphaera and/or Pivot by the Company under the Collaboration Agreement for: (i) First dosing of patient in US phase 1 trial (ii) US Phase 1 trial completion with endpoints met and (iii) US Phase 2 trial completion with endpoints met (each as described in the Collaboration Agreement) which payments would have totaled 1.625 million in the event Pivot were to be successful in claiming that the Company conducted Phase 1 and Phase 2 trials or that would be due upon successful milestones in the future. The Company also agreed to pay to Pivot a one-time payment of 4.4 million, increased from 4.0 million, upon FDA Approval (as described in the Collaboration Agreement) and the parties agreed that no further FDA Approval milestone payment(s) shall be due to Pivot in the event that the Company receives additional FDA Approval(s). The Settlement Agreement contains customary mutual releases and covenants not to sue. Except as otherwise provided in the Settlement Agreement, all terms in the Collaboration Agreement shall remain in full force and effect. 
 Item 1A. Ri sk Factors. 
 
 Our focus on IkT-001 Pro as a treatment for PAH may not prove successful. 
 
 It is possible that IkT-001Pro may not improve the side effect profile for the treatment of PAH compared to imatinib mesylate or may not be effective as an add-on treatment for PAH. There can be no assurance that the Company s clinical trial in PAH for IkT-001Pro will be successful and even if successful that IkT-001Pro will be approved by the FDA for PAH or achieve marketplace success. 
 Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equi ty Securities and Use of Proceeds.
