 Risks and Uncertainties 
 We are subject to those risks common to our business and industry and also those risks common to early stage development companies. These risks include those disclosed in Part I, Item 1A, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the SEC on February 29, 2024. 
 T hese condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared by management in accordance with U.S. GAAP and this basis assumes that we will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. As of the date of this report, our existing cash resources, which were primarily provided as a result of our business combination with Alussa Energy Acquisition Corporation in 2021 (the "Business Combination") and issuance of equity securities, are sufficient to support our planned operations for at least the next 12 months from the date of issuance of these financial statements. Therefore, our financial statements have been prepared on the basis that we will continue as a going concern. 
 In accordance with ASC 360-10, the Company records impairment losses on long-lived assets used in operations when events and circumstances indicate that long-lived assets might be impaired and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the carrying amounts of those assets. During Q3 2024, events and circumstances indicated that the Company s long-lived assets related to its Norwegian business might be impaired. However, the Company s estimate of undiscounted cash flows indicated that such carrying amounts were expected to be recovered.

No cash payments or other adjustments to the accrued restructuring charge balance have been made in 2024. 
 2023 Restructuring 
 In November 2023, FREYR announced a restructuring process (the 2023 Restructuring ), which focused on preserving Company liquidity as we advanced our strategies on the Customer Qualification Plant CQP and at the manufacturing project in the U.S. Giga America ), while continuing to fund critical initiatives. We accrued severance and other termination benefits of million related to the 2023 Restructuring which was recognized in Restructuring charge in the consolidated statements of operation and comprehensive loss for the year ended December 31, 2023.

 Equity Method Investments 
 In March 2023, the Company contributed million to obtain a equity interest in Nidec Energy AS (the Nidec JV ), a joint venture with Nidec Europe BV Nidec ). The Nidec JV was formed to develop, manufacture, and sell battery modules and battery packs for industrial and utility-grade ESS applications. The Company determined that the Nidec JV was a VIE, and that the Company was not the primary beneficiary. Additionally, the Company is able to exercise significant influence but not control over the operating and financial policies of the Nidec JV. Therefore, the Company has recorded its investment in the Nidec JV as an equity method investment. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recognized million and million, respectively, as its share of net loss of equity method investee in the condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss related to the Company s equity method investment in the Nidec JV. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , t he Company recognized other income of million and million related to general and administrative expenses incurred on behalf of the Nidec JV.

 million warrants outstanding (the Warrants ), consisting of million public warrants (the Public Warrants and million private warrants (the Private Warrants as of September 30, 2024 and million Public Warrants and million Private Warrants as of December 31, 2023. Each Warrant entitles the holder thereof to purchase share of our common stock at a price of per share, subject to adjustments. The Warrants will expire on July 9, 2026, or earlier upon redemption or liquidation. 
 We may call the Public Warrants for redemption once they become exercisable, in whole and not in part, at a price of per Public Warrant, so long as we provide at least days prior written notice of redemption to each Public Warrant holder, and if, and only if, the reported last sales price of our common stock equals or exceeds per share for each of trading days within the trading-day period ending on the third trading day before the date on which we send the notice of redemption to the Public Warrant holders. We determined that the Public Warrants are equity classified as they are indexed to our common stock and qualify for classification within stockholders equity. As such, the Public Warrants are presented as part of additional paid-in capital on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. 
 The Private Warrants are identical to the Public Warrants, except that so long as they are held by a certain holder or any of its permitted transferees, the Private Warrants: (i) may be exercised for cash or on a cashless basis and (ii) shall not be redeemable by FREYR. We determined that the Private Warrants are not considered indexed to our common stock as the holder of the Private Warrants impacts the settlement amount and therefore, they are liability classified. The Private Warrants are presented as warrant liability on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. 
 If Private Warrants are sold or transferred to another party that is not the specified holder or any of its permitted transferees, the Private Warrants become Public Warrants and qualify for classification within stockholders equity at the fair value on the date of the transfer. See also Note 9 Fair Value Measurement. 
 EDGE Warrants 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had million and million warrants, respectively, held by EDGE Global LLC EDGE or its co-owners that were outstanding and exercisable. These warrants entitle the holder thereof to purchase share of our common stock at the exercise price, subject to adjustments. The EDGE warrants outstanding as of September 30, 2024 have an exercise price of and expire on September 30, 2025. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, million warrants with an exercise price of were exercised and settled in shares, net of shares withheld to satisfy the exercise price.

 We measured our warrant liabilities for Private Warrants, at fair value based on significant inputs not observable in the market, which caused them to be classified as Level 3 measurements within the fair value hierarchy. These valuations used assumptions and estimates that we believed a market participant would use in making the same valuation. Changes in the fair value of the Private Warrants were recognized as a warrant liability fair value adjustment within the condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the carrying value of all other financial assets and liabilities approximated their respective fair values. 
 Private Warrants 
 The Private Warrants were valued using the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model. See Note 8 Warrants above for further details. Our use of the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model for the Private Warrants required the use of subjective assumptions, including: 
 The risk-free interest rate assumption was based on the U.S. Treasury Rates commensurate with the contractual terms of the Private Warrants. 
 The expected term was determined based on the expiration date of the Private Warrants. 
 The expected volatility assumption was based on the implied volatility of the publicly traded Public Warrants. 
 The fair value of the Private Warrants was determined using this approach, an exercise price of and a share price of as of September 30, 2024 and as of December 31, 2023. An increase in each of the risk-free interest rate, expected term, or expected volatility, in isolation, would increase the fair value measurement, and a decrease in each of these assumptions would decrease the fair value measurement of the Private Warrants.

 2021 Plan 
 In June 2021, we adopted the 2021 Equity Incentive Plan (amended and restated as of April 22, 2024), (the 2021 Plan ). The 2021 Plan provides for the grant of stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units RSUs ), stock appreciation rights, performance units, and performance shares to our employees, directors, and consultants. Generally, our stock options and RSUs vest annually over , and our stock options expire after the grant date. Options are typically forfeited when the employment relationship ends for employees and they do not typically forfeit for directors. Generally, our RSUs are equity classified awards that are expected to be settled in shares. All exercised options are expected to be settled in shares, net of shares withheld to satisfy the award exercise price. As of September 30, 2024, million shares were authorized for issuance to satisfy share-based compensation awards made under the 2021 Plan. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, million options were granted, million options were forfeited, million RSUs were granted, RSUs were forfeited and RSUs vested. 
 2019 Plan 
 The 2019 Incentive Stock Option Plan (the 2019 Plan was issued on September 11, 2019. All stock options and warrants granted under the 2019 Plan are fully vested and no further awards can be issued. Outstanding awards under the 2019 Plan are required to be cash settled. The awards granted under the 2019 Plan are liability-classified awards, and as such, these awards are remeasured to fair value at each reporting date with changes to the fair value recognized as stock compensation expense in general and administrative expense or research and development expense within the condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. Cumulative stock compensation expense cannot be reduced below the grant date fair value of the original award.

 Overview 
 FREYR Battery, Inc. a Delaware Corporation FREYR, the Company , we , or us is a developer of sustainable clean energy capacity and solutions. We aim to accelerate the decarbonization of global energy systems by industrializing technologies across the battery and renewables value chains. 
 As of September 30, 2024, FREYR was evaluating several project opportunities in the U.S. and Europe to establish a profitable, commercial enterprise and to create shareholder value. 
 Transaction agreement with Trina Solar (Schweiz) AG 
 On November 6, 2024, FREYR announced that the Company had entered into an agreement Transaction Agreement ), to acquire all the shares of capital stock of Trina Solar US Holding Inc., a Delaware corporation Trina Solar US Holding and related subsidiaries. As part of the Transaction Agreement, FREYR will acquire Trina Solar US Holding s five-gigawatt solar module facility in Wilmer, Texas. 
 Under the Transaction Agreement, FREYR will acquire Trina Solar US Holding for (i) 100 million cash consideration (subject to an adjustment for any leakage); (ii) 15.4 million shares of common stock; (iii) a 150 million one percent per annum senior unsecured note due in five years; and (iv) an 80 million seven percent unsecured convertible note due in five years, which, subject to approval by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, is convertible in up to two conversions into 30.4 million shares of common stock, in aggregate, with the second conversion being subject to Company stockholder approval. 
 On the same date, FREYR entered into a preferred stock purchase agreement for the purchase of non-voting preferred stock of FREYR in exchange for 100 million, to be funded across two tranches of 50 million each, upon closing and thereafter upon FREYR s sole discretion upon proceeding to a final investment decision with respect to a solar cell facility. 
 Further, on the same date, FREYR and a co-founder and significant shareholder of Trina Solar US Holding, entered into a securities purchase agreement for approximately 14.8 million of shares of FREYR s common stock for 1.05 per share, representing an aggregate private placement of 10 of FREYR s common stock outstanding. 
 The transaction is subject to certain customary conditions precedent, including, among other things, receipt by Trina Solar US Holding of certain third-party consents, completion of the first tranche of 50 million of preferred stock issuance and an internal reorganization to be completed by Trina Solar US Holding and it is expected to close around year-end 2024. 
 Under the terms of the Transaction Agreement, within 6 months of closing, FREYR will use its reasonable efforts to dispose, divest, transfer or otherwise sell the assets and operations that constitute its European business. 
 In connection with the transaction, the Company terminated its SemiSolid TM technology license with 24M Technologies 24M ). Pursuant to the termination of the 24M license agreement, FREYR agreed to pay a service fee of 3 million and transfer all of its 24M preferred stock to 24M for 1.00. There are no further cash obligations. 
 Upon closing of the transaction, FREYR plans to execute a multi-phase strategic plan to establish a vertically integrated US solar manufacturing footprint. The next phase of the plan will be to construct a five gigawatt solar cell manufacturing facility in the US. Site selection is underway and FREYR is targeting a start of construction in Q2 2025 with anticipated first solar cell production in 2H 2026. The creation of a US owned and operated company that can provide a turnkey solar technology solution is expected to solve a bottleneck for developers, create up to 1,800 direct jobs, satisfy local content requirements for US solar projects, and competitively differentiate FREYR.

 Operating expenses 
 General and administrative 
 General and administrative expenses primarily consist of personnel and personnel-related expenses for our marketing and administrative personnel, costs for administrative offices, insurance, and outside professional services including legal, accounting, and other advisory services . 
 General and administrative expenses decreased by 9.3 million or 33 , to 18.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 27.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. General and administrative expenses decreased by 24.0 million or 28 , to 61.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 85.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. These decreases are primarily due to decreases in personnel costs and professional fees. 
 Research and development R D 
 R D expenses consist primarily of personnel and personnel-related expenses for employees engaged in research and development activities, internal and external engineering, depreciation for R D equipment and facilities, supplies and services, and contributions to research institutions. R D expenses also include development costs related to our technology license with 24M. 
 14 

R D expenses increased by 1.5 million or 22 , to 8.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 7.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. R D expenses increased by 12.6 million or 69 , to 30.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 18.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This is primarily due to an increase in personnel costs, depreciation and spending on R D operations at the CQP, which started operations late in the second quarter of 2023. 
 Restructuring charge 
 Restructuring charge consists primarily of accrued severance and other termination benefits related to the reduction in force programs that began in September 2024 and November 2023. Restructuring costs were 4.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 4.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, with no corresponding charges incurred in the comparable periods in 2023. See further discussion in Note 2 Restructuring to our condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 Share of net loss of equity method investee 
 Share of net loss of equity method investee consists of our proportionate share of the net earnings (losses) and other comprehensive income (loss) from Nidec Energy AS. See further discussion in Note 5 - Long-Term Investments to our condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 Other income (expense) 
 Other income (expense) primarily consists of the fair value adjustments on our warrant liability, convertible note, interest income and expense, net foreign currency transaction gains and losses, and grant income. 
 Other income decreased by 20.8 million or 83 , to 4.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 25.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Other income decreased by 42.0 million or 75 , to 14.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 55.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. These decreases are primarily due to a (0.1) million and 1.2 million net foreign currency transaction (loss) gain for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to a 3.2 million and 20.5 million gain for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively as well as a 1.1 million and 1.3 million Warrant liability fair value adjustment for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively compared to a 24.4 million and 23.2 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had approximately 184.1 million of cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash and current liabilities of approximately 31.4 million. To date, our principal sources of liquidity have been proceeds received from our Business Combination, issuance of equity securities, and amounts received from government grants. Historically, these funds have been used for constructing and equipping our battery manufacturing facilities, including the CQP and Giga Arctic, the purchase of land for Giga America, technology licensing, R D activities, and general corporate purposes. 
 Our future liquidity requirements depend on many factors, including the timing and extent of the following: capital expenditures for construction of future facilities and purchase of related equipment; spending to support licensing and R D efforts; spending on other growth initiatives or expansion into new geographies, including through joint ventures; spending to support our future revenue generating activities; and general economic conditions. 
 Until we can generate sufficient revenue to adequately support our liquidity requirements, we expect to fund short-term cash needs through our existing cash balances. We believe that we have sufficient liquidity to meet our contractual obligations and commitments for at least the 12 months following September 30, 2024. 
 Our long-term operating needs and planned investments in our business and manufacturing footprint, as currently devised, will require significant financing to complete. Such financing may not be available at terms acceptable to us, or at all. The credit market and financial services industry have in the past, and may in the future, experience periods of uncertainty that could impact the availability and cost of equity and debt financing. If we are unable to raise substantial additional capital, our ability to invest in further facilities or other development projects will be significantly delayed or curtailed which would have a material adverse impact on our business prospects and results of operations. If we raise funds by issuing debt securities, these debt securities would have rights, preferences, and privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock. The terms of debt securities or other borrowings could impose significant restrictions on our operations. If we raise funds by issuing equity securities, dilution to stockholders may result. Any equity securities issued may also provide for rights, preferences, or privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock. 
 In November 2024, the Company estimated that a five gigawatt solar cell manufacturing facility in the U.S. would have a total cost of approximately 850 million. The estimated costs of construction remain subject to site selection, technology and product specification decisions, ongoing business, financing, and operational changes, and changes to the overall macroeconomic environment. We will continue to provide updates to reflect material developments, including approvals or commitments for spending that differ materially from our previous estimates. 
 15 

Our planned capital expenditures are based on management s current estimates and may be subject to change. There can be no assurance that we will execute our capital expenditure plans as currently estimated, without addition, reduction, or modification. We may also from time to time reduce or increase planned spending on specific capital projects and/or adjust the timing of planned capital expenditures due to factors both within and outside of our control, including the availability of financing. As a result, actual capital expenditures in future years may differ materially from the amounts discussed above. 
 Cash Flow Summary

 Operating Activities 
 Net cash used in operating activities was 72.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 54.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in cash used in operating activities was primarily driven by an increase in cash used for working capital, largely due to the receipt in 2023 of 23.5 million in government grants with no corresponding amount in 2024, partially offset by a decrease in net loss, adjusted for non-cash items. 
 Investing Activities 
 Net cash used in investing activities was 11.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 168.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in cash used in investing activities was primarily driven by a decrease in purchases of property and equipment due to lower construction activity in the current year period, and proceeds from the return of property and equipment deposits of 22.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 with no corresponding amount for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Financing Activities 
 Net cash used in financing activities was 4.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 relating to the purchase of the Company s non-controlling interest in its U.S. joint venture and zero for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 Our critical accounting policies and estimates are consistent with those described in the Management s Discussion and Analysis section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the SEC on February 29, 2024. There have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies during the nine months ended September 30, 2024.
