Our allowance for credit losses is an estimate of expected losses over the remaining contractual life of our receivables based on an ongoing analysis of collectability, historical collection experience, current economic and industry conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. The allowance is calculated using a historical loss rate applied to the current aging analysis. We may also apply additional allowance when warranted by specific facts and circumstances. We generally write off accounts receivable balances when the customer files for bankruptcy or when all commonly used methods of collection have been exhausted. 
 
 On February 23, 2023, we, certain of our subsidiaries and a wholly-owned special purpose subsidiary (the SPV ), entered into a three -year million revolving accounts receivable securitization facility (the Securitization Facility with Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, and certain third -party financial institutions (the Purchasers ). The Securitization Facility permits the SPV to draw up to a total of 300 million, subject to the outstanding amount of the receivables pool and other factors. The Securitization Facility matures on February 23, 2026, and is subject to customary termination events related to transactions of this type. The sale of receivables from the SPV is accounted for in the Company s financial statements as a "true-sale" under Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") Topic 860. 
 
 Under the Securitization Facility, the SPV sells to the Purchasers certain receivables, including all rights, title, and interest in the related receivables Sold Receivables ). The parties intend that the conveyance of accounts receivables to the Purchasers, for the ratable benefit of the Purchasers will constitute a purchase and sale of receivables and not a pledge for security. The SPV has guaranteed to each Purchaser the prompt payment of Sold Receivables, and to secure the prompt payment and performance of such guaranteed obligations, the SPV has granted a security interest to the Purchasers in all assets of the SPV. In our capacity as servicer under the Securitization Facility, we are responsible for administering and collecting receivables and have made customary representations, warranties, covenants and indemnities. We do not record a servicing asset or liability since the estimated fair value of the servicing of the receivables approximates the servicing income. We also provided a performance guarantee for the benefit of the Purchasers. 
 
 The Securitization Facility is subject to interest charges, at the adjusted one -month Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR plus a margin basis points) on the amount of the outstanding facility. The SPV was required to pay an upfront fee and a commitment fee in connection with the Securitization Facility. Servicing fee income recognized during the nine -months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, was million and million, respectively. The SPV is a separate legal entity with its own separate creditors who will be entitled to access the SPV s assets before the assets become available to us. As a result, the SPV s assets are not available to pay our creditors or any of our subsidiaries, although collections from the receivables in excess of amounts required to repay the Purchasers under the Securitization Facility and other creditors of the SPV may be remitted to us. 
 
 The proceeds of the Securitization Facility are classified as operating activities in our condensed consolidated statements of cash flows. Cash received from collections of Sold Receivables is used by the SPV to fund additional purchases of receivables on a revolving basis or to return all or any portion of outstanding capital of the Purchasers. Subsequent collections on the pledged receivables, which have not been sold, will be classified as operating cash flows at the time of collection. 
 
 The amount sold to the Purchasers was million at each of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, which was derecognized from the condensed consolidated balance sheets. As collateral against sold receivables, the SPV maintains a certain level of unsold receivables, which was million and million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Total receivables sold under the Securitization Facility were million and million in the nine -months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Pursuant to the Securitization Facility, we recognized a charge of million in the nine -month period ended September 30, 2023 representing the discount on the accounts receivable balance initially transferred to the SPV. This discount was included in our (loss) gain on disposal of assets in our condensed consolidated statements of operations. 

The following table provides a roll-forward of the allowance for credit losses. The allowance is deducted from the amortized cost basis of accounts receivable in our condensed consolidated balance sheets (in millions):

2024 Refinancing Activities. On June 3, 2024, we issued billion in aggregate principal amount of Senior Secured First Lien Notes due 2029 (the 2029 Notes pursuant to an indenture, dated as of June 3, 2024, between us, the guarantors party thereto and U.S. Bank Trust Company, National Association, as trustee and collateral agent (the 2029 Notes Indenture ). The 2029 Notes were issued at par. Interest in the 2029 Notes accrues from June 3, 2024, and is payable semiannually, on January 15 and July 15 of each year, beginning on January 15, 2025. 
 
 The net proceeds from the 2029 Notes were used, together with the net proceeds from a million tranche F term loan (the 2024 Term Loan and a million draw under our Revolving Credit Facility (as defined below), both under the Senior Credit Facility (as defined below), and cash on hand, to pre-pay our billion tranche E 2019 Term Loan under the Senior Credit Facility; repurchase in a tender offer million of face value of our outstanding 2026 Notes; and pay all costs and accrued interest in connection with the offering. 
 
 The 2029 Notes and related guarantees are our senior secured first lien obligations. The 2029 Notes rank: 
 
 equally in right of payment with all of our existing and future pari passu senior debt; senior in right of payment to all of our existing and future subordinated debt; 
 
 effectively senior to all of our existing and future unsecured debt or junior lien debt to the extent of the value of the collateral securing the 2029 Notes; 
 
 effectively subordinated to any existing and future debt that is secured by a lien on any assets not constituting collateral securing the 2029 Notes to the extent of the value of such assets; and 
 
 structurally subordinated to any existing and future debt and liabilities of our subsidiaries that do not guarantee the 2029 Notes. 

On June 4, 2024, we entered into a third amendment to the Fifth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the Third Amendment and as amended, including by the Third Amendment, the Senior Credit Facility ), dated as of December 1, 2021. 
 
 The Third Amendment, among other things, provided for (i) the new million 2024 Term Loan and (ii) increased aggregate commitments under our existing million revolving credit facility (the Revolving Credit Facility that matures December 31, 2027 by million, and a concurrent termination of the separate commitments under a million tranche of revolving commitments that were to mature on December 1, 2026, resulting in aggregate commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility of million. 
 
 The 2024 Term Loan bears interest, at our option, at either the Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR plus an applicable margin or the Base Rate plus an applicable margin. Base Rate is defined as the greatest of (i) the administrative agent s prime rate, (ii) the overnight federal funds rate plus and (iii) Adjusted Term SOFR (as defined in the Senior Credit Facility) for a one -month tenor in effect on such day plus . The applicable margin with respect to the 2024 Term Loan is for all SOFR borrowings and for all Base Rate borrowings. The 2024 Term Loan also requires us to make quarterly principal reductions of million beginning September 30, 2024. To the extent all or any portion of the 2024 Term Loan is repaid or prepaid prior to the one year anniversary of the effective date of the Third Amendment, a prepayment fee equal to of the amount of the 2024 Term Loan being repaid or prepaid will apply. 
 
 The Revolving Credit Facility bears interest, at our option, based on SOFR plus - or the Base Rate plus - , in each case based on a first lien leverage ratio (the First Lien Leverage Ratio as set forth in the Senior Credit Facility. The Company is required to pay a commitment fee on the average daily unused portion of the Revolving Credit Facility, which rate may range from to , based on the First Lien Leverage Ratio. 
 
 The costs associated with these 2024 refinancing activities totaled million, of which million were capitalized as deferred loan costs, to be amortized over the lives of the respective debt obligations. Our loss from the early extinguishment of debt for these 2024 refinancing activities was million, which was composed of expensing of the remaining million of costs and the write-off of million of unamortized deferred loan costs and premiums related to the debts that were pre-paid. 
 
 Repurchase of Debt and Subsequent Event . On May 6, 2024, our Board of Directors authorized us to use up to million of available liquidity to repurchase our outstanding indebtedness through December 31, 2025. The extent of such repurchases, including the amount and timing of any repurchases, will depend on general market conditions, regulatory requirements, alternative investment opportunities and other considerations. This repurchase program does not require us to repurchase a minimum amount of debt, and it may be modified, suspended or terminated at any time without prior notice. During the nine -months ended September 30, 2024, we used million of cash to repurchase and retire million of the face value of our outstanding 2027 Notes on the open market, resulting in a million gain from early extinguishment of debt. In addition, during the three and nine -months ended September 30, 2024, we used million of cash to repurchase and retire million of the face value of our 2021 Term Loans on the open market, resulting in a million gain from early extinguishment of debt. At September 30, 2024, we were obligated to repurchase an additional million of face value of our 2021 Term Loans on the open market for million, and this transaction will be completed later in the fourth quarter of 2024, using cash on hand. 
 
 On September 25, 2024, we entered into an agreement with a lender to purchase a portion of our 2021 Term Loans. As a result of this agreement, the lender has purchased 32 million of the face value of our outstanding 2021 Term Loans for 30 million, under this plan. We plan to repurchase and retire these portions of our 2021 Term Loan later in the fourth quarter of 2024 using cash on hand. 
 
 Interest Rate Cap s. On February 23, 2023, we entered into two interest rate caps pursuant to an International Swaps and Derivatives Association Master Agreement (the ISDA Master Agreement with two counterparties, Wells Fargo Bank, NA and Truist Bank, respectively. On June 25, 2024, we amended the notional amount of the interest rate caps in order to better match the outstanding amounts of the related outstanding indebtedness. At September 30, 2024, the caps had a combined notional value of approximately billion and mature on December 31, 2025. The interest rate caps protect us against adverse fluctuations in interest rates by reducing our exposure to variability in cash flows on a portion of our variable-rate debt. The interest rate caps are designated as cash flow hedges of our risk of changes in our cash flows attributable to changes in 1 -month SOFR on our outstanding variable-rate debt in accordance with ASC 815. We elected to apply the optional expedient in ASC 848, Reference Rate Reform, that enabled us to consider the amended swaps a continuation of the existing contracts. As a result, the transition did not have an impact on our hedge accounting or a material impact to our financial statements. 

The interest rate caps, as amended, effectively limit the annual interest charged on our 2021 Term Loan and our 2024 Term Loan to a maximum of 1 -month Term SOFR of 4.96 and 5.047 . We are required to pay aggregate fees in connection with the interest rate caps of approximately million that is due and payable at maturity on December 31, 2025. On the initial designation date, we recognized an asset and corresponding liability for the deferred premium payable equal to 34 million. The asset is amortized into interest expense straight-line over the term of the hedging relationship. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the recorded value of the asset was million and million, net of accumulated amortization, respectively. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the fair value of the derivative liability was million and million, respectively. We present the deferred premium, the asset, and the fair value of the derivative, net within other non-current liabilities in our condensed consolidated balance sheets. 
 
 The ISDA Master Agreement, together with its related schedules, contain customary representations, warranties and covenants. The interest rate caps were not entered into for speculative trading purposes. Changes in the fair value of the interest rate caps are reported as a component of other comprehensive income. Actual gains and losses are reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings and are presented in the same income statement line item as the earnings effect of the hedged transaction. Gains and losses on the derivative instrument representing hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recognized currently in earnings and are presented in the same line of the income statement for the hedged item. We recognized million and million, respectively, of amortization expense for the asset during the nine -months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, which is included as a component of cash flows from operating activities in our condensed consolidated statements of cash flows. Cash flows received from the counterparties pursuant to the interest rate caps are included as components of cash flows from financing activities in our condensed consolidated statements of cash flows. During the nine -months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we received million and million, respectively, of cash payments from the counterparties that we reclassified as reductions of interest expense from the interest rate caps in our condensed consolidated statements of operations. 
 
 For all of our interest bearing obligations, we made interest payments of approximately million and million during the nine -months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. During the nine -months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we capitalized million and million of interest payments, respectively, related to the Assembly Atlanta project.

Our tax provision for each quarter is based upon these full year projections, which are revised each reporting period. These projections incorporate estimates of permanent differences between U.S. GAAP income or loss and taxable income or loss, state income taxes and adjustments to our liability for unrecognized tax benefits to adjust our statutory federal income tax rate of to our effective income tax rate. For the nine -month period ended September 30, 2024, these estimates increased or decreased our statutory Federal income tax rate to our effective income tax rate of as follows: state income taxes added 5 , permanent differences between our U.S. GAAP income and taxable income added 1 and changes to our reserve accounts reduced our rate by 2 . For the nine -month period ended September 30, 2023, these estimates increased or decreased our statutory federal income tax rate to our effective income tax rate of as follows: state income taxes added , permanent differences between our U.S. GAAP income and taxable income reduced our rate by and discrete items further reduced our rate by . 
 
 During the nine -months ended September 30, 2024, we made million of federal and state income tax payments, net of refunds. During the fourth quarter of 2024, we anticipate making income tax payments, net refunds, of approximately million. As of September 30, 2024, we have an aggregate of approximately million of various state operating loss carryforwards, of which we expect that approximately million will not be utilized due to section 382 limitations and those that will expire prior to utilization.

 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

Executive Overview 
 
 Introduction . The following discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations of Gray Television, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries (except as the context otherwise provides, Gray Media, Gray, the Company, we, us or our should be read in conjunction with our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere herein, as well as with our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 (the 2023 Form 10-K filed with the SEC. 
 
 Business Overview . We are a multimedia company headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia. We are the nation s largest owner of top-rated local television stations and digital assets serving 113 television markets that collectively reach approximately 36 percent of US television households. The portfolio includes 77 markets with the top-rated television station and 100 markets with the first and/or second highest rated television station, as well as the largest Telemundo Affiliate group with 43 markets totaling nearly 1.5 million Hispanic TV Households. We also own Gray Digital Media, a full-service digital agency offering national and local clients digital marketing strategies with the most advanced digital products and services. Our additional media properties include video production companies Raycom Sports, Tupelo Media Group, and PowerNation Studios, and studio production facilities Assembly Atlanta and Third Rail Studios. Gray also owns a majority interest in Swirl Films. 
 
 Our operating revenues are derived primarily from broadcasting and internet advertising, retransmission consent fees and, to a lesser extent, other sources such as production of television and event programming, television commercials, tower rentals and management fees. For the nine-months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we generated revenue of 2.6 billion and 2.4 billion, respectively. 
 
 Revenues, Operations, Cyclicality and Seasonality. Broadcast advertising is sold for placement generally preceding or following a television station s network programming and within local and syndicated programming. Broadcast advertising is sold in time increments and is priced primarily on the basis of a program s popularity among the specific audience an advertiser desires to reach. In addition, broadcast advertising rates are affected by the number of advertisers competing for the available time, the size and demographic makeup of the market served by the station and the availability of alternative advertising media in the market area. Broadcast advertising rates are generally the highest during the most desirable viewing hours, with corresponding reductions during other hours. The ratings of a local station affiliated with a major network can be affected by ratings of network programming. Most advertising contracts are short-term, and generally run only for a few weeks. 
 
 We also sell internet advertising on our stations websites and mobile apps. These advertisements may be sold as banner advertisements, video advertisements and other types of advertisements or sponsorships. 
 
 Our broadcast and internet advertising revenues are affected by several factors that we consider to be seasonal in nature. These factors include: 

Spending by political candidates, political parties and special interest groups increases during the even-numbered on-year of the two-year election cycle. This political spending typically is heaviest during the fourth quarter of such years; 

Broadcast advertising revenue is generally highest in the second and fourth quarters each year. This seasonality results partly from increases in advertising in the spring and in the period leading up to and including the holiday season; 

Core advertising revenue on our NBC-affiliated stations increases in certain years as a result of broadcasts of the Olympic Games; and 

Because our stations and markets are not evenly divided among the Big Four broadcast networks, our local and national advertising revenue can fluctuate between years related to which network broadcasts the Super Bowl. 

We derived a material portion of our non-political broadcast advertising revenue from advertisers in a limited number of industries, particularly the services sector, comprising financial, legal and medical advertisers, and the automotive industry. The services sector has become an increasingly important source of advertising revenue over the past few years. During the nine-months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, approximately 24 and 26 , respectively, of our broadcast advertising revenue (excluding political advertising revenue) was obtained from advertising sales to the services sector. During the nine-months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 approximately 19 and 20 , respectively, of our broadcast advertising revenue (excluding political advertising revenue) was obtained from advertising sales to automotive customers. Revenue from these industries may represent a lower percentage of total revenue in even-numbered years due to, among other things, the decreased availability of advertising time, as a result of such years being the on-year of the two-year election cycle. 

26

Our primary broadcasting operating expenses are employee compensation, related benefits and programming costs. In addition, the broadcasting operations incur overhead expenses, such as maintenance, supplies, insurance, rent and utilities. A large portion of the operating expenses of our broadcasting operations is fixed. We continue to monitor our operating expenses and seek opportunities to reduce them where possible. 
 
 2024 Refinancing Activities . During 2024, we have undertaken several steps to implement our strategy to reduce our debt and extend the maturity of portions of our debt obligations that were scheduled to mature in the near future. Collectively, these actions are intended to resolve concerns over upcoming maturities, and to take advantage of other opportunities in the markets. Please refer to Note 4. Long-Term Debt for further information. During the nine-months ended September 30, 2024, we have: 

Amended our Senior Credit Facility to: 

o 
 Increase lender commitments under our Revolving Credit Facility to 680 million and extend the maturity date to December 31, 2027; 

o 
 Fully repay the 1.15 billion 2019 Term Loan that was scheduled to mature on January 2, 2026; 

o 
 Issue the 500 million 2024 Term Loan that will mature on June 4, 2029; 

Pre-paid through a tender offer, 690 million of the 700 million in outstanding 2026 Notes that was scheduled to mature on July 15, 2026; and 

Issued 1.25 billion of our 2029 Notes, that are secured pari passu with our Senior Credit Facility and that will mature on July 15, 2029. 

In addition, during 2024 we used 72 million of cash to repurchase and retire 79 million of our outstanding 2027 Notes on the open market and we have used 14 million of cash to repurchase and retire 15 million of our outstanding 2021 Term Loans on the open market. 
 
 We project, including actions taken to date, a reduction of our Adjusted Total Indebtedness (also referred to as Net Debt during the full-year 2024 of 500 million. 
 
 Cost Containment Initiatives . Starting in August 2024, we began identifying and implementing various measures throughout the company that we expect will further reduce operating expenses by at least 60 million on an annualized basis. As part of our routine budgeting process, we are carefully evaluating our capital expenditure needs for 2025. 
 
 We have taken several steps to reduce personnel expenses in 2025. These steps include streamlining workflows at our television stations and other business units, eliminating over 150 unfilled positions for which we were recruiting, eliminating certain positions which will not be filled following expected normal attrition throughout the second half of this year, and, for the first time in many years, eliminating certain positions across our television stations and certain business units. Importantly, despite these staffing changes, we will continue to employ journalists and meteorologists and continue to produce local newscasts in all of our existing local news markets, including small markets. 
 
 As a result of, and to account properly for, the costs to achieve these and certain additional cost containment measures, we currently anticipate recording a one-time charge of approximately 2 million in the fourth quarter of 2024. 
 
 Please see our Results of Operations and Liquidity and Capital Resources sections below for further discussion of our operating results.

Results of Operations 
 
 Three-Months Ended September 30, 2024 the 2024 three-month period Compared to Three-Months Ended September 30, 2023 the 2023 three-month period 
 
 Revenue. Total revenue increased 147 million, or 18 in the 2024 three-month period. During the 2024 three-month period: 

Core advertising revenue increased by 2 million or 1 , due in part to 20 million of advertising revenue on our 53 NBC channels from the broadcast of the 2024 Olympic Games; 

Consistent with 2024 being the on-year of the two-year election cycle, political advertising revenue increased by 147 million, or 565 ; 

Retransmission consent revenue decreased by 9 million or 2 , due to a decrease in subscribers, offset, in part, by an increase in rates; and

Production Company Expenses . Production company operating expenses (before depreciation, amortization and gain or loss on disposal of assets) increased 4 million or 22 in the 2024 three-month period compared to the 2023 three-month period due primarily to increases in utilities, maintenance and property taxes at Assembly Atlanta is operational.

 Amortization . Amortization of intangible assets totaled 31 million and 48 million in the 2024 three-month period and the 2023 three-month period, respectively. The decrease in amortization expense was the result of finite-lived intangible assets becoming fully amortized and the impairment of certain finite-lived intangible assets in 2023. 
 
 Impairment of Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets . During the 2023 three-month period, we recognized a loss of 43 million for impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets related to the bankruptcy of Diamond Sports Group, LLC Diamond 
 
 Loss (Gain) on Disposal of Assets, Net . Loss on disposal of assets was 16 million in the 2024 three-month period primarily resulting from the acquisition of a construction permit to build Television station KCBU in exchange for the divestiture of television stations KCWY and KGWN that resulted in a loss of 14 million.

 Interest Expense . Interest expense increased 19 million, or 17 , to 130 million for the 2024 three-month period compared to the 2023 three-month period. This increase was primarily attributable to increases in interest rates on our floating rate Senior Credit Agreement to 8.9 in the 2024 three-month period compared to 8.1 in the 2023 three-month period. Our average outstanding total long-term debt balance was 6.1 billion and 6.3 billion during the 2024 and 2023 three-month periods, respectively.

28

Gain (Loss) from Early Extinguishment of Debt. During the 2024 three-month period, we have recorded a gain of 6 million primarily as a result of purchases of our 2027 Notes and 2021 Term Loans on the open market at a discount to their face value. 
 
 Income Tax Expense. We recognized income tax expense of 32 million and 3 million in the 2024 and 2023 three-month periods, respectively. Our effective income tax rates were 25 and (8 in the 2024 and 2023 three-month periods, respectively. We estimate our differences between taxable income or loss and recorded income or loss on an annual basis. Our tax provision for each interim period is based upon these full year projections that are revised each reporting period. These projections incorporate estimates of permanent differences between U.S. GAAP income or loss and taxable income or loss, state income taxes and adjustments to our liability for unrecognized tax benefits. For the 2024 three-month period, these estimates increased our statutory federal income tax rate of 21 to our effective income tax rate of 25 as follows: state income taxes added 5 , permanent differences between our U.S. GAAP income and taxable income added 1 and changes to our reserve accounts reduced our rate by 2 . 
 
 Nine-Months Ended September 30, 2024 the 2024 nine-month period Compared to Nine-Months Ended September 30, 2023 the 2023 nine-month period 
 
 Revenue. Total revenue increased 182 million, or 8 , in the 2024 nine-month period from the 2023 nine-month period. During the 2024 nine-month period: 

Core advertising revenue increased by 11 million or 1 , due in part to advertising revenue of 18 million from the broadcast of the Super Bowl on our 54 CBS channels in the 2024 nine-month period, compared to 6 million of revenue relating to the broadcast of the Super Bowl on our 27 FOX channels during the 2023 nine-month period, and 20 million of advertising revenue on our 53 NBC channels from the broadcast of the 2024 Olympic Games; 

Consistent with 2024 being the on-year of the two-year election cycle, political advertising revenue increased by 201 million, or 437 ; 

Retransmission consent revenue decreased by 46 million or 4 , due to a decrease in subscribers, offset, in part, by an increase in rates; and 

Production company revenue increased by 14 million, or 26 , in the 2024 nine-month period due to the start-up of our operations at Assembly Atlanta. 

Broadcasting Expenses . Broadcasting expenses (before depreciation, amortization and gain or loss on disposal of assets) increased 55 million or 3 , to 1.7 billion. During the 2024 nine-month period: 

Broadcasting payroll expenses increased by 47 million as a result of routine increases in compensation, accruals for incentive compensation and the filling of vacant positions. 

Broadcasting non-payroll expenses increased by 8 million primarily due to an increase in sports programming expenses, partially offset by reductions in retransmission expense. 

Broadcast non-cash stock-based compensation expense was 4 million in each of the 2024 and 2023 nine-month periods. 

Production Company Expenses . Production company expenses (before depreciation, amortization, impairment and gain or loss on disposal of assets) decreased by approximately 31 million in the 2024 nine-month period to 57 million, compared to 88 million in the 2023 nine-month period.

29

Depreciation. Depreciation of property and equipment totaled 108 million and 106 million in the 2024 nine-month period and the 2023 nine-month period, respectively. Depreciation increased primarily due to the addition of depreciable assets. 
 
 Amortization . Amortization of intangible assets totaled 94 million and 147 million in the 2024 nine-month period and the 2023 nine-month period, respectively. Amortization decreased primarily due to finite-lived intangible assets becoming fully amortized.

Our average outstanding total long-term debt balance was 6.2 billion and 6.3 billion during the 2024 and 2023 nine-month periods, respectively. Interest expense in the 2024 and 2023 nine-month periods also included 9 million and 7 million, respectively, related to the non-cash amortization of fees for our interest rate cap agreement.

 Loss from Early Extinguishment of Debt. The actions taken in our 2024 refinancing activities have resulted in a total net loss on early extinguishment of debt of 1 million in the 2024 nine-month period. The components of this net loss include: 

A gain of 6 million from the repurchase of our 2027 Notes in the open market at a discount;

These projections incorporate estimates of permanent differences between U.S. GAAP income or loss and taxable income or loss, state income taxes and adjustments to our liability for unrecognized tax benefits. For the 2024 nine-month period, these estimates increased our statutory federal income tax rate of 21 to our effective income tax rate of 25 as follows: state income taxes added 5 , permanent differences between our U.S. GAAP income and taxable income added 1 and changes to our reserve accounts reduced our rate by 2 .

Net Cash Provided By (Used In) Operating, Investing and Financing Activities. Net cash provided by operating activities was 383 million in the 2024 nine-month period compared to 565 million in the 2023 nine-month period. The decrease in net cash provided by operating activities in the 2024 nine-month period compared to the 2023 nine-month period was due primarily to an increase in net income, a decrease in impairment of goodwill and intangible assets, an increase in gain on sale of investments and a decrease in working capital. 
 
 Net cash provided by investing activities was 10 million in the 2024 nine-month period compared to net cash used in investing activities of 259 million for the 2023 nine-month period. The increase in the net amount provided was primarily due to a decrease in cash used for purchases of property and equipment and an increase in proceeds received from the sale of investments and other assets. 
 
 Net cash used in financing activities was 345 million in the 2024 nine-month period compared to net cash used in financing activities of 346 million in the 2023 nine-month period. Excluding temporary borrowings and re-payments of amounts under our Revolving Credit Facility, in the 2024 nine-month period, we issued 1.25 billion in of our 2029 Notes and 500 million of the 2024 Term Loan to pre-pay our 1.2 billion 2019 Term Loan all under the Senior Credit Facility. In addition, we repurchased in a tender offer, 690 million of face value of our outstanding 2026 Notes. In connection with these transactions, we paid 47 million in fees and expenses. Furthermore, in the 2024 nine-month period, we used 72 million, to repurchase a portion of our 2027 Notes, and 14 million, to repurchase a portion of our 2021 Term Loan on the open market. During each period, we used 39 million of cash to pay dividends to holders of our preferred stock. During 2024 and 2023 nine-month periods, we used 24 million and 22 million, respectively, to pay dividends to holders of our common stock. 

31

Liquidity. Based on our debt outstanding as of September 30, 2024, we estimate that we will make approximately 487 million in debt interest payments over the twelve months immediately following September 30, 2024. Although our cash flows from operations are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, we anticipate that our cash on hand, future cash expected to be generated from operations, borrowings from time to time under the Senior Credit Facility (or any such other credit facility as may be in place at the appropriate time) and, potentially, external equity or debt financing, will be sufficient to fund any debt service obligations, estimated capital expenditures and acquisition-related obligations for the next twelve months and the forseeable future. Any potential equity or debt financing would depend upon, among other things, the costs and availability of such financing at the appropriate time. We also believe that our future cash expected to be generated from operations and borrowing availability under the Senior Credit Facility (or any such other credit facility) will be sufficient to fund our future capital expenditures and long-term debt service obligations for the next twelve months and the forseeable future. 
 
 Collateral, Covenants and Restrictions of our credit agreements. Our obligations under the Senior Credit Agreement and the 2029 Notes are secured by substantially all of our consolidated assets, excluding real estate. In addition, substantially all of our subsidiaries are joint and several guarantors of, and our ownership interests in those subsidiaries are pledged to collateralize, our obligations under the Senior Credit Agreement. Gray Television, Inc. is a holding company, and has no material independent assets or operations. For all applicable periods, the 2026 Notes, 2027 Notes, 2030 Notes and 2031 Notes have been fully and unconditionally guaranteed, on a joint and several, senior unsecured basis, by substantially all of Gray Television, Inc. s subsidiaries. Any subsidiaries of Gray Television, Inc. that do not guarantee the 2026 Notes, 2027 Notes, 2030 Notes and 2031 Notes are not material or are designated as unrestricted under the Senior Credit Agreement. As of September 30, 2024, June 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024, there were no significant restrictions on the ability of Gray Television, Inc. s subsidiaries to distribute cash to Gray or to the guarantor subsidiaries. 
 
 The Senior Credit Agreement contains affirmative and restrictive covenants with which we must comply, including: (a) limitations on additional indebtedness, (b) limitations on liens, (c) limitations on the sale of assets, (d) limitations on guarantees, (e) limitations on investments and acquisitions, (f) limitations on the payment of dividends and share repurchases, (g) limitations on mergers and (h) maintenance of the First Lien Leverage Ratio while any amount is outstanding under the revolving credit facility, as well as other customary covenants for credit facilities of this type. The 2026 Notes, 2027 Notes, 2029 Notes, 2030 Notes and 2031 Notes include covenants with which we must comply which are typical for financing transactions of their nature. As of September 30, 2024, June 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024, we were in compliance with all required covenants under all of our debt obligations. 
 
 In addition to results prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, Leverage Ratio Denominator is a metric that management uses to calculate our compliance with our financial covenants in our indebtedness agreements. This metric is calculated as specified in our Senior Credit Agreement and is a significant measure that represents the denominator of a formula used to calculate compliance with material financial covenants within the Senior Credit Agreement that govern our ability to incur indebtedness, incur liens, make investments and make restricted payments, among other limitations usual and customary for credit agreements of this type. Accordingly, management believes this metric is a very material metric to our debt and equity investors. 
 
 Leverage Ratio Denominator gives effect to the revenue and broadcast expenses of all completed acquisitions and divestitures as if they had been acquired or divested, respectively, on October 1, 2022. It also gives effect to certain operating synergies expected from the acquisitions and related financings, and adds back professional fees incurred in completing the acquisitions. Certain of the financial information related to the acquisitions, if applicable, has been derived from, and adjusted based on, unaudited, un-reviewed financial information prepared by other entities, which Gray cannot independently verify. We cannot assure you that such financial information would not be materially different if such information were audited or reviewed and no assurances can be provided as to the accuracy of such information, or that our actual results would not differ materially from this financial information if the acquisitions had been completed on the stated date. In addition, the presentation of Leverage Ratio Denominator as determined in the Senior Credit Agreement and the adjustments to such information, including expected synergies, if applicable, resulting from such transactions, may not comply with U.S. GAAP or the requirements for pro forma financial information under Regulation S-X under the Securities Act of 1933. Leverage Ratio Denominator, as determined in the Senior Credit Agreement, represents an average amount for the preceding eight quarters then ended. 
 
 Our Adjusted Total Indebtedness , First Lien Adjusted Total Indebtedness and Secured Adjusted Total Indebtedness , in each case Net of All Cash , represents the amount of outstanding principal of our long-term debt, plus certain other obligations as defined in our Senior Credit Agreement, less all cash (excluding restricted cash) for the applicable amount of indebtedness.

Debt. As of September 30, 2024, long-term debt consisted of obligations under our Senior Credit Facility, the 10 million in aggregate principal amount outstanding under 2026 Notes, the 671 million in aggregate principal amount outstanding of our 2027 Notes, the 1.25 billion in aggregate principal amount of our 2029 Notes, the 800 million in aggregate principal amount outstanding of our 2030 Notes and the 1.3 billion outstanding of our 2031 Notes. As of September 30, 2024, the Senior Credit Facility provided total commitments of 2.6 billion, consisting of a 1.4 billion term loan facility, a 499 million term loan facility, and 674 million available under our revolving credit facility. We were in compliance with the covenants in these debt agreements at September 30, 2024. 
 
 Repurchase of Debt and Subsequent Event . On May 6, 2024, our Board of Directors authorized us to use up to 250 million of available liquidity to repurchase our outstanding indebtedness through December 31, 2025. On November 7, 2024, our Board of Directors authorized an increase in our debt repurchase authorization to repurchase additional debt in the open market, which replenished the previous authorization, bringing the total current authorization to 250 million. The extent of such repurchases, including the amount and timing of any repurchases, will depend on general market conditions, regulatory requirements, alternative investment opportunities and other considerations. This repurchase program does not require us to repurchase a minimum amount of debt, and it may be modified, suspended or terminated at any time without prior notice. During the nine-months ended September 30, 2024, we used 72 million of cash to repurchase and retire 79 million of the face value of our outstanding 2027 Notes, resulting in a 7 million gain from early extinguishment of debt. In addition, during the nine-months ended September 30, 2024, we used 14 million of cash to repurchase and retire 15 million of the face value of our 2021 Term Loans on the open market, resulting in a 2 million gain from early extinguishment of debt. At September 30, 2024, we were obligated to repurchase and additional 7 million of face value of our 2021 Term Loans on the open market for 6 million and this transaction will be completed later in the fourth quarter of 2024, using cash on hand. 
 
 On September 25, 2024, we entered into a forward debt repurchase agreement with a lender to purchase on the open market up to 50 million of our 2021 Term Loans. As a result of this agreement, the lender has repurchased 32 million of the face value of our outstanding 2021 Term Loans for 30 million, under this plan. We plan to repurchase and retire these portions of our 2021 Term Loan in the fourth quarter of 2024 using cash on hand. 
 
 Capital Expenditures. We currently expect capital expenditures for full-year 2024 of 135 million, which includes approximately 35 million, net of reimbursements, related to Assembly Atlanta. We expect additional reimbursements of approximately 18 million in first quarter of 2025 related to 2024 capital expenditures at Assembly Atlanta. 
 
 Acquisition and Divestitures. On July 1, 2024, we completed a transaction with Marquee Broadcasting, Inc. Marquee in which we sold our television stations KCWY (NBC) in the Casper, Wyoming market (DMA 198) and KGWN (CBS) in the Cheyenne, Wyoming market (DMA 194) in exchange for Marquee s FCC permit authorizing the construction of a new television station, that will be built in the Salt Lake City, Utah market (DMA 27), and will be known as KCBU. No cash or other consideration was exchanged to fulfill the terms of this exchange. The sale of television station KCWY and KGWN resulted in a non-cash loss on disposal of 14 million. 
 
 Other. We file a consolidated federal income tax return and such state and local tax returns as are required. During the nine-months ended September 30, 2024, we made federal or state income tax payments totaling 130 million, net of refunds. During the fourth quarter of 2024, we anticipate making income tax payments, net of refunds, of approximately 3 million. As of September 30, 2024, we have an aggregate of approximately 282 million of various state operating loss carryforwards, of which we expect that approximately 201 million will not be utilized due to section 382 limitations and those that will expire prior to utilization. After applying our state effective tax rate, this amount is included in our valuation allowance for deferred tax assets. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies 
 
 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make judgments and estimations that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. We consider our accounting policies relating to intangible assets and income taxes to be critical policies that require judgments or estimations in their application where variances in those judgments or estimations could make a significant difference to future reported results. These critical accounting policies and estimates are more fully discussed in our 2023 Form 10-K.
