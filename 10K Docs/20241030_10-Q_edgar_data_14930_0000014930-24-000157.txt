 BRUNSWICK CORPORATION 
 Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements 
 (Unaudited) 

These financial statements should be read in conjunction with, and have been prepared in conformity with, the accounting principles reflected in the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in Brunswick's 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 (the 2023 Form 10-K). These results include, in management's opinion, all normal and recurring adjustments necessary to present fairly Brunswick's financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Due to the seasonality of Brunswick's businesses, the interim results are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the remainder of the year. 

Recently Issued Accounting Standards 
 
 Segment Reporting: In November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280) Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures , which adds new disclosure requirements related to significant segment expenses regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker (CODM) and included in each reported measure of segment profit or loss, other segment items that constitute the difference between segment revenues less significant segment expenses and the measure of profit or loss, disclosure of the CODM's title and position as well as an explanation of how the CODM uses the reported measures and expanded interim disclosures. ASU 2023-07 is effective for financial statements for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2023 and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, and as a result, will require additional segment expense disclosures when adopted in the Company's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024 and in periodic reports thereafter. 
 
 Income Taxes : In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740) Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures . Under this ASU, entities must disclose, on an annual basis, specific categories in the rate reconciliation and provide additional information for reconciling items that meet a quantitative threshold. In addition, ASU 2023-09 requires entities to disclose additional information about income taxes paid. ASU 2023-09 is effective for financial statements for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. We are currently evaluating the potential impact of adopting this guidance on the consolidated financial statements and the notes to consolidated financial statements.

 percent and percent, respectively. The effective tax rate for the three months ended September 28, 2024 was higher than the same period in the prior year, primarily due to the discrete income tax expense recorded associated with an increase in the state valuation allowance. 
 
 The effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023 was percent and percent, respectively. The effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 28, 2024 was lower than the same period in the prior year, primarily due to the prior year intercompany sale of certain intellectual property rights from one of our affiliates in Norway to the United States, partially offset by the discrete income tax expense recorded associated with an increase in the state valuation allowance. 
 
 The Company has evaluated the effects of the Global Anti-Base Erosion Model Rules set forth by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), referred to as Pillar Two , which establishes a global minimum corporate tax rate of 15 percent. The Company has determined that Pillar Two legislation has been enacted in one or more of the jurisdictions in which we operate and the Company is within the scope of the legislation. The Company assessed such enacted legislation, and, as applicable, the transitional safe harbor provisions of Pillar Two, and concluded that the tax effects are not material to the financial statements. 
 
 The Company is regularly audited by federal, state and foreign tax authorities. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has completed its field examination and has issued its Revenue Agents Report through the 2014 tax year and all open issues have been resolved. The Company is currently open to tax examinations by the IRS for the 2020 through 2022 tax years. The Company is open to state and local tax audits in major tax jurisdictions dating back to the 2017 taxable year. The Company is no longer subject to income tax examinations by any major foreign tax jurisdiction for years prior to 2016.

 Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 
 Certain statements in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of Brunswick Corporation (the Company, we, us, our) are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are based on current expectations, estimates, and projections about our business and by their nature address matters that are, to different degrees, uncertain. Actual results may differ materially from expectations and projections as of the date of this filing due to various risks and uncertainties. For additional information regarding forward-looking statements, refer to Forward-Looking Statements below. 
 
 Certain statements in Management's Discussion and Analysis are based on non-GAAP financial measures. GAAP refers to generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. A "non-GAAP financial measure" is a numerical measure of a registrant s historical or future financial performance, financial position or cash flows that excludes amounts, or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of excluding amounts, that are included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in the consolidated statements of operations, balance sheets or statements of cash flows of the issuer; or includes amounts, or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of including amounts, that are excluded from the most directly comparable measure so calculated and presented. For example, the discussion of our cash flows includes an analysis of free cash flows and total liquidity; the discussion of our net sales includes net sales on a constant currency basis; the discussion of our net sales includes net sales excluding acquisitions; and the discussion of our earnings includes a presentation of operating earnings and operating margin excluding restructuring, exit and impairment charges, purchase accounting amortization, acquisition, integration, and IT related costs, IT security incident costs and other applicable charges and of diluted earnings per common share, as adjusted. Non-GAAP financial measures do not include operating and statistical measures. 
 
 We include non-GAAP financial measures in Management's Discussion and Analysis as management believes these measures and the information they provide are useful to investors because they permit investors to view our performance using the same tools that management uses to evaluate our ongoing business performance. In order to better align our reported results with the internal metrics management uses to evaluate business performance as well as to provide better comparisons to prior periods and peer data, non-GAAP measures exclude the impact of purchase accounting amortization related to acquisitions, among other adjustments. 
 
 We do not provide forward-looking guidance for certain financial measures on a GAAP basis because we are unable to predict certain items contained in the GAAP measures without unreasonable efforts. These items may include restructuring, exit and impairment costs, special tax items, acquisition-related costs, and certain other unusual adjustments. 
 
 Acquisitions 
 
 On September 12, 2024, we acquired additional Freedom Boat Club franchise operations and territories in Southeast Florida for net cash consideration of 31.2 million. Refer to Note 4 Acquisitions in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. 
 
 During the fourth quarter of 2023, we acquired additional Freedom Boat Club franchise operations and territory rights as well as certain marine assets in the Southeast United States for net cash consideration of 16.0 million. On September 1, 2023, the Company acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of Fliteboard for 88.3 million net cash consideration. Refer to Note 4 Acquisitions in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.

 Overview 
 
 Net sales decreased 20 percent during the third quarter of 2024 when compared with the third quarter of 2023, as the impact of continued lower wholesale ordering by dealers and OEMs, combined with higher discounts in certain business segments, was only partially offset by annual price increases and benefits from well-received new products. As anticipated, our Propulsion segment delivered lower sales and operating earnings versus the third quarter of 2023, but we continue to outpace the market at retail and have gained 420 basis points of U.S. outboard engine share in the quarter. Our Engine Parts and Accessories (Engine P A) segment had another strong quarter, with record operating margins of 26 , and with both the Products and Distribution businesses contributing to margin expansion, despite slightly lower sales. The completed transition of engines parts and accessories distribution to our new, state-of-the-art facility in Brownsburg, Indiana continues to provide efficiency and delivery time benefits, enabling modest international sales growth versus the prior year quarter. As anticipated, our Navico Group segment had lower sales and operating earnings versus the third quarter of 2023 due to continued soft marine OEM order rates and retailers delaying aftermarket orders until closer to the holiday selling season, which was partially offset by slightly higher sales in the Europe, Middle East and Africa region. Our Boat segment had sales and operating earnings below the third quarter of 2023, consistent with lower planned production levels and fewer manufacturing days due to the extended summer shutdowns. Our international net sales decreased 13 percent and 12 percent in the third quarter on a GAAP and constant currency basis, respectively. 
 
 Net sales decreased 19 percent during the nine months ended September 28, 2024, when compared with the prior year, due to the same factors described above. Our international net sales decreased 13 percent in the nine months ended September 28, 2024 on a GAAP and constant currency basis. 
 
 Operating earnings in the third quarter of 2024 were 98.4 million and 125.9 million on a GAAP and As Adjusted basis, respectively. This compares to operating earnings during the third quarter of 2023 of 196.1 million and 230.1 million on a GAAP and As Adjusted basis, respectively. 
 
 Operating earnings in the nine months ended September 28, 2024 were 367.3 million and 448.2 million on a GAAP and As Adjusted basis, respectively. This compares to operating earnings during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 of 626.6 million and 727.4 million on a GAAP and As Adjusted basis, respectively. 
 
 Matters Affecting Comparability 
 
 Changes in Foreign Currency Rates. Percentage changes in net sales expressed in constant currency reflect the impact that changes in currency exchange rates had on comparisons of net sales. To determine this information, net sales transacted in currencies other than the U.S. dollar have been translated to U.S. dollars using the average exchange rates that were in effect during the comparative period. The percentage change in net sales expressed on a constant currency basis better reflects the changes in the underlying business trends, excluding the impact of translation arising from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Approximately 26 percent of our annual net sales are transacted in a currency other than the U.S. dollar. Our most material exposures include sales in Euros, Canadian dollars, Australian dollars, and Brazilian real. 
 
 The table below summarizes the impact of changes in currency exchange rates and also the impact of acquisitions on our net sales:

 We recognized an Income tax provision for the three and nine months ended September 28, 2024 of 22.6 million and 68.9 million, respectively, compared to 46.2 million and 181.5 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The decrease in the Income tax provision for the three months ended September 28, 2024 is primarily due to lower pretax income. The decrease in the Income tax provision for the nine months ended September 28, 2024 is primarily due to the prior year intercompany sale of certain intellectual property rights and lower pretax income. We have also evaluated the effects of Pillar Two legislation and concluded that the tax effects are not material to the financial statements. Refer to Note 11 Income Taxes in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. 
 
 The effective tax rate, which is calculated as the Income tax provision as a percentage of Earnings before income taxes, was 32.3 percent and 23.8 percent for the three and nine months ended September 28, 2024, respectively.

Cash Flow, Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 The following table sets forth an analysis of free cash flow for the nine months ended: 
 (in millions) Sep 28, 2024 Sep 30, 2023 Net cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations 137.5 458.1 Net cash (used for) provided by: Plus: Capital expenditures (137.1) (233.1) Plus: Proceeds from the sale of property, plant and equipment 8.2 10.6 Plus: Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents (2.0) (4.0) Total free cash flow (A) 
 6.6 231.6 
 
 (A) We define "Free cash flow" as cash flow from operating and investing activities of continuing operations (excluding cash provided by or used for acquisitions, investments, purchases or sales/maturities of marketable securities and other investing activities, net of tax) and the effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents. Free cash flow is not intended as an alternative measure of cash flow from operations, as determined in accordance with GAAP in the United States. We use this financial measure both in presenting our results to shareholders and the investment community and in our internal evaluation and management of our businesses. We believe that this financial measure and the information it provides are useful to investors because it permits investors to view our performance using the same tool that we use to gauge progress in achieving our goals. We believe that the non-GAAP financial measure "Free cash flow" is also useful to investors because it is an indication of cash flow that may be available to fund investments in future growth initiatives. 
 
 Our major sources of funds for capital investments, acquisitions, share repurchase programs and dividend payments are cash generated from operating activities, available cash and marketable securities balances, divestitures and borrowings. We evaluate potential acquisitions, divestitures and joint ventures in the ordinary course of business. 
 
 2024 Cash Flow 
 
 Net cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations in the nine months ended September 28, 2024 totaled 137.5 million compared to 458.1 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease is primarily due to working capital and lower net earnings. Working capital is defined as Accounts and notes receivable, Inventories and Prepaid expenses and other, net of Accounts payable and Accrued expenses as presented in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, excluding the impact of acquisitions and non-cash adjustments.

Table of Contents 

 The primary drivers of net cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations in the nine months ended September 28, 2024 was net earnings, net of non-cash items, partially offset by working capital. Accounts and notes receivable increased 11.2 million, primarily due to the timing of collections. Inventory increased 16.8 million due to lower sales and the impact of seasonal inventory build. Accounts payable decreased 166.3 million, primarily due to lower purchasing resulting from reduced production and timing of payments. Accrued expenses decreased 123.9 million, primarily driven by lower accrued variable compensation expense. 
 
 Net cash used for investing activities was 154.0 million and primarily related to 137.1 million of capital expenditures and 80.9 million of purchases of marketable securities, partially offset by 82.1 million of sales or maturities of marketable securities. Our capital spending was focused on investments in new products and technologies. 
 
 Net cash used for financing activities was 147.0 million and primarily related to payments of long-term debt including current maturities, common stock repurchases and cash dividends paid to common shareholders, partially offset by short-term and long-term debt issuances. 
 
 2023 Cash Flow 
 
 Net cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 totaled 458.1 million versus 313.8 million in the comparable period of 2022. The increase is primarily due to decreases in working capital usage, partially offset by lower net earnings. 
 
 The primary drivers of net cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 were net earnings, net of non-cash items, partially offset by working capital usage.

Accounts payable decreased 141.2 million, primarily due to lower purchasing resulting from reduced production. Accrued expenses decreased 25.0 million, primarily driven by a reduction in our derivative liability position. 
 
 Net cash used for investing activities was 309.9 million, which included 233.1 million of capital expenditures and 89.6 million of cash paid for acquisitions, partially offset by 10.6 million of sales of property, plant and equipment and 3.8 million of sales or maturities of marketable securities. Our capital spending was focused on investments in capacity expansion, new products and technologies. 
 
 Net cash used for financing activities was 402.9 million and primarily related to common stock repurchases, cash dividends paid to common stockholders and payments of long-term debt including current maturities.

Total liquidity is not intended as an alternative measure to Cash and cash equivalents and Short-term investments in marketable securities as determined in accordance with GAAP in the United States. We use this financial measure both in presenting our results to shareholders and the investment community and in our internal evaluation and management of our businesses. We believe that this financial measure and the information it provides are useful to investors because it permits investors to view our performance using the same metric that we use to gauge progress in achieving our goals. We believe that the non-GAAP financial measure Total liquidity is also useful to investors because it is an indication of our available highly liquid assets and immediate sources of financing. 
 
 Cash, cash equivalents and mark etable securities t otaled 284.9 million as of September 28, 2024, a decrease of 183.7 million from 468.6 million as of December 31, 2023, and a decrease of 46.8 million from 331.7 million as of September 30, 2023. Total debt as of September 28, 2024, December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2023 was 2,571.9 million, 2,430.4 million and 2,431.0 million, respectively. Our debt-to-capitalization ratio was 56 percent as of September 28, 2024, an increase from 54 percent as of both December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2023. 
 
 There were no borrowings under the Revolving Credit Agreement (Credit Facility) during the nine months ended September 28, 2024 and we did not have any borrowings outstanding as of September 28, 2024. Available borrowing capacity under the Credit Facility as of September 28, 2024 totaled 747.0 million, net of 3.0 million of letters of credit outstanding. During the nine months ended September 28, 2024, the maximum amount utilized under the CP Program was 245.0 million, and as of September 28, 2024, the Company had 195.0 million of borrowings outstanding under the CP Program. Refer to Note 12 Debt in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and Note 14 - Debt in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the 2023 Form 10-K, for further details. 
 
 The levels of borrowing capacity under our Credit Facility and CP Program are limited by both a leverage and interest coverage test. These covenants also pertain to termination provisions included in our wholesale financing joint-venture arrangements with Wells Fargo Commercial Distribution Finance. Based on our anticipated earnings generation throughout the year, we expect to maintain sufficient cushion against the existing debt covenants. 
 
 2024 Capital Strategy 
 
 We continue to moderate our capital spending and now anticipate approximately 165 million of capital expenditures for the year. We have also revised our share repurchase plan and now anticipate share repurchases of approximately 200 million in 2024.

 Item 5. Other Information 
 
 Securities Trading Plans of Executive Officers and Directors 
 
 Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act provides an affirmative defense that enables pre-arranged transactions in securities in a manner that avoids concerns about initiating transactions at a future date while possibly in possession of material nonpublic information. Our Insider Trading and Unauthorized Disclosures Policy permits our officers and directors to enter into trading plans designed to comply with Rule 10b5-1. 
 
 During the quarterly period ended September 28, 2024, Nancy E. Cooper, our Board Chair, adopted a Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement, dated September 2, 2024, providing for the sale each quarter of 35 percent of net shares of her director compensation paid in common stock. The duration of the trading arrangement is from the selling start date of February 3, 2025 through November 8, 2025, or earlier if all transactions under the trading arrangement are completed prior to that date. The trading arrangement is intended to satisfy the affirmative defense in Rule 10b5-1(c). None of our officers (as defined in Rule 16a-1(f) under the Exchange Act) or any other directors adopted or terminated a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan or adopted or terminated a non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement (as defined in Item 408(c) of Regulation S-K) during the quarterly period.
