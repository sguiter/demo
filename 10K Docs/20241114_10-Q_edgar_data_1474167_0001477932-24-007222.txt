Additionally, as of September 30, 2024, the Company had positive working capital of , an accumulated deficit of , and stockholders equity of . It is the management s opinion that these conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern for a period of twelve months from the date of this filing. The Company s revenues are not able to sustain its operations, and concerns exist regarding the Company s ability to meet its obligations as they become due. The Company is subject to a number of risks to those of smaller commercial companies, including dependence on key individuals and products, the difficulties inherent in the development of a commercial market, the need to obtain additional capital, competition from larger companies, and other pharmaceutical and health care companies. Management evaluated the above conditions which raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern to determine if it can meet its obligations for the subsequent twelve months from the date of this filing. Management considered its ability to access future capital, curtail expenses if needed, expand product lines, and acquire new products. Management s plans include expansion of brand name products to the market, expanding the current product portfolio, and evaluating acquisition targets to expand distribution. Furthermore, the Company intends to vertically integrate the supply chain distribution network. During the period up to the issuance of this report the Company has signed multiple distribution agreements for its SPL products in Europe and Asia and a variety of contract manufacturing agreements though its subsidiary, Cana Laboratories Holdings (Cyprus) Limited. Finally, the Company plans to further access the capital markets in order to raise additional funds through equity offerings.

Management will also consider postponing the repayment of its outstanding Trade Facility balance as of September 30, 2024), intends to make substantial efforts to receive additional debt financing through its subsidiary, Cosmofarm SA, and plans to raise additional equity funds through utilizing its outstanding warrants. Following such efforts, on September 26, 2024, the Company entered into a Warrant Inducement Letter with an investor pursuant to . On July 29, 2024 the Company s subsidiary Cosmofarm SA entered into an agreement with a third-party lender in the principal amount of 400,000 432,760). Moreover, the Company s management is considering postponing certain repayments of suppliers and creditors. However, management cannot provide any assurances that the Company will be successful in accomplishing any of its plans. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to successfully accomplish the plans described herein and eventually secure other sources of financing and attain profitable operations. Considering the above, management is of the view that substantial doubt exists about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effect on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that may result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 8 Table of Contents COSMOS HEALTH INC.

Property and Equipment additions Property and Equipment additions are recognized as assets when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the asset will flow to the entity and the cost of the asset can be measured reliably. Additions are initially measured at cost, which includes all costs directly attributable to bringing the asset to its working condition and location for its intended use. This may include purchase price, freight, installation, and any directly attributable professional fees. They are capitalized if their cost exceeds a certain threshold. The threshold is determined based on materiality considerations. Costs below the threshold are typically expensed as incurred. After initial recognition, additions are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses. Depreciation is calculated systematically over the estimated useful life of the asset. They are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. If the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount, an impairment loss is recognized, and the carrying amount of the asset is adjusted accordingly. Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction, or production of qualifying assets, including Property and Equipment additions, are capitalized as part of the cost of those assets. 13 Table of Contents COSMOS HEALTH INC.

A useful life of 10 years is also used for the platforms included in Note 4 as Software and the customer bases. The Company evaluates the remaining useful life of intangible assets annually to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining amortization period. If the estimate of the intangible asset s remaining useful life is changed, the remaining carrying amount of the intangible asset will be amortized prospectively over that revised remaining useful life. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, no revision to the remaining amortization period of the intangible assets was made.

Revenue increased overall, compared to the prior periods, and the increase in the nine-month period is mainly attributed to the wholesale revenue stream which was further increased with the enhancement of the overall customer base (acquisition of Bikas and other customer bases from smaller wholesalers). The revenue decrease in the three-month period relates to CANA s decreased revenue for the period due to a few delays in the production process and Decahedron s decreased sales of nutraceutical products. Management evaluates that both subsidiaries will rebound and increase their revenue in the fourth quarter of 2024. The Company had a net loss of 2,182,534 on revenue of 12,411,048 versus a net loss of 3,415,077 on revenue of 12,823,797 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively and net loss of 6,639,935 on revenue of 40,202,238 versus a net loss of 4,790,597 on revenue of 37,537,003 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

The decrease in net loss for the three-month period ended September 31, 2024 compared to the three-month period ended September 31, 2023 is mainly attributable to significantly higher general and administrative costs in the 2023 period, which include material provisions relating to allowances on trade and other receivables and other tax related provisions. Cost of Goods Sold The Company had costs of goods sold of 11,204,186 versus 11,609,039 (a decrease of 3.49 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively and 36,894,502 versus 34,418,334 (an increase of 7.19 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase in the cost of goods sold in the nine month period is a consequence of the increased sales and the equivalent decrease in the three month period is also in accordance with the decreased revenue. Our future revenue growth is expected to continue to be affected by various factors such as industry growth trends, including drug utilization, the introduction of new innovative brand therapies, the likely increase in the number of branded pharmaceutical products that will be available over the next few years price increases and price deflation, general economic conditions, including the effects of the current conflict in the Ukraine, the coronavirus in the United Kingdom and the member states of European Union, competition within the industry, customer consolidation, changes in pharmaceutical manufacturer pricing and distribution policies and practices, increased downward pressure on government and other third party reimbursement rates to our customers, and changes in government rules and regulations.

The increase in gross profit for the nine-month period is attributable to the inclusion of CANA s pharma manufacturing stream which attributes high gross margins, whereas it was merely included for three months in the equivalent 2023 period (acquisition was dated on June 30, 2023). The gross profit was relatively stable between the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

The 95.83 increase in depreciation and amortization expense for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 is attributable to increased depreciation expense charged for Cosmofarm s and CANA s wholly owned facilities (acquired in April and June 2023 respectively) as long as the amortization expense for the pharmaceutical licenses acquired in December 2023. Other Income (Expense) The Company had interest expense related to notes payable and lines of credit of 181,429 and 151,274 versus 692,547 and 529,782 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase in interest expense of 19.93 and 30.72 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 respectively, contrary to the overall decrease in notes payable and lines of credit balances for the equivalent periods, is mainly attributable to the increased floating rates of the Company s facilities in 2024 (Euribor, Libor and Euro Short Term rate). Interest income amounted to 101,236 and 309,031 versus 110,596 and 555,281 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively and the decrease is attributable to both the decreased outstanding balances of the Company s Loans Receivable and Loans Receivable from related parties and the fact that the Company had interest income arising from treasury bills in the 2023 comparative periods. The other income, net recorded in the 9-month period ended September 30, 2024, of 160,598 mostly relates to write-offs of liabilities of our dormant subsidiary Cana Laboratories Holdings (Cyprus) Limited Cana arising from the past which had no substance and thus written off. The corresponding other expense and other income amounts in the three-month periods ended September 30, 2024, and 2023 of 1,921 and 14,404, respectively, primarily relate to prior period income/(expenses) of the Greek subsidiaries. Additionally, a gain on debt extinguishment relating to the write-off of a share settled debt obligation and the forgiveness of a notes payable balance for a total gain of 1,911,476 was recorded in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Finally, the Company has recorded a bargain purchase gain of 1,633,842 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The bargain purchase gain recorded is solely arising from the gain recognized upon acquisition of Cana. No equivalent extraordinary items were included in the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024. Foreign currency translation adjustment, ne t and total comprehensive gain/loss The Company had a foreign currency translation adjustment gain of 747,879 and a foreign currency translation adjustment loss of 27,988 versus losses of 890,645 and 470,994, attributable to the positive movement of the exchange rates during the three months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and a net comprehensive loss of 7,629,679 and 12,862,947 versus a loss of 4,254,902 and 5,276,644 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase in comprehensive loss in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 mostly derives from the deemed dividends of 9,793 for the inducement to exercise the warrants exercised on September 26, 2024 and 6,185,231 for the grant of new warrants (200 of the ones exercised). For more details regarding the warrant transaction and the deemed dividends recorded please refer to Note 15. Liquidity and Capital Resources As of September 30, 2024, the Company had working capital of 11,027,653 compared to 12,285,310 as of December 31, 2023. The Company had cash and cash equivalents of 3,314,845 versus 3,833,195 as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The Company had net cash used in operating activities of 3,883,215 and 16,587,726 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The Company has devoted substantially all of its cash resources to expand through organic business growth and has incurred significant general and administrative expenses in order to enable the financing and growth of its business and operations. The decrease is attributable to the significant working capital outflows in 2023, when the company utilized the proceeds from 2022 equity offerings to repay its significant outstanding liabilities in addition to providing prepayments to certain suppliers. The Company had net cash used provided by investing activities of 206,971 and net cash used in investing activities 10,399,264 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the net cash used in investing activities was mainly attributable to the outflow of consideration transferred through the Cana acquisition, the purchase of ZipDoctor Inc, the purchase of Bikas customer base, the purchase of a list of pharmaceutical licenses, the purchase of Cosmofarm s warehouse facilities and the advances provided for the purchase of the facilities in Montreal, Canada from the parent company. 45 Table of Contents The Company had net cash provided by financing activities of 3,426,621 versus 8,401,750 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company received proceeds from lines of credit of 18,831,043 and payments of lines of credit of 19,504,594, for a net decrease on the lines of credit of 673,551. The significantly higher inflows arising from financing activities in 2023 was mainly attributable to the receipt of the 4,750,107 subscription receivable, due from December s 2022 offering. However, the Company repaid 1,494,867 of the outstanding notes payable during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023, versus 814,267 of debt repayments within the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 whilst having proceeds from notes payable of 434,797 versus 1,059,300 for the nine month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 respectively. During the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, the Company raised additional equity funds through two Prospectus Supplements to its Registration Statement on Form S-3 (No. 333-267550) filed with the SEC on February 29 and March 7, 2024. More specifically, the Company sold 901,488 shares of common stock for gross proceeds of 649,039. Additionally, the Company received gross proceeds from the exercise of a number of its outstanding warrants pursuant to the warrant inducement transaction occurred on September 26, 2024 of 4,240,977. We anticipate using cash in our bank account as of September 30, 2024, cash generated from debt or equity financing, from investing activities or from management loans to the extent that funds are available to do so to conduct our business in the upcoming year. Management is not obligated to provide these or any other funds. If we fail to meet these requirements, we may lose the qualification for quotation and our securities would no longer trade on Nasdaq Capital Market. Further, as a consequence we would fail to satisfy our reporting obligations with the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC ), and investors would then own stock in a company that does not provide the disclosure available in quarterly and annual reports filed with the SEC and investors may have increased difficulty in selling their stock as we will be non-reporting. Going Concern The Company s unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America U.S. GAAP ), which contemplates the continuation of the Company as a going concern. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company had revenue of 40,202,238, net loss of 6,639,935 and net cash used in operations of 3,883,215. Additionally, as of September 30, 2024, the Company had positive working capital of 11,027,653, an accumulated deficit of 104,479,692, and stockholders equity of 34,976,599. It is the management s opinion that these conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern for a period of twelve months from the date of this filing. The Company s revenues are not able to sustain its operations, and concerns exist regarding the Company s ability to meet its obligations as they become due. The Company is subject to a number of risks to those of smaller commercial companies, including dependence on key individuals and products, the difficulties inherent in the development of a commercial market, the need to obtain additional capital, competition from larger companies, and other pharmaceutical and health care companies. Management evaluated the above conditions which raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern to determine if it can meet its obligations for the subsequent twelve months from the date of this filing. Management considered its ability to access future capital, curtail expenses if needed, expand product lines, and acquire new products. Management s plans include expansion of brand name products to the market, expanding the current product portfolio, and evaluating acquisition targets to expand distribution. Furthermore, the Company intends to vertically integrate the supply chain distribution network. During the period up to the issuance of this report the Company has signed multiple distribution agreements for its SPL products in Europe and Asia and a variety of contract manufacturing agreements though its subsidiary, CANA. Finally, the Company plans to further access the capital markets in order to raise additional funds through equity offerings. More specifically, up to the issuance of its consolidated financial statements for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company has sold 901,488 shares of common stock for net proceeds of 629,426 through two Prospectus Supplements to its Registration Statement on Form S-3 (No. 333-267550) filed with the SEC on February 29 and March 7, 2024. Management will also consider postponing the repayment of its outstanding Trade Facility 1,588,163 balance as of September 30, 2024), intends to make substantial efforts to receive additional debt financing through its subsidiary, Cosmofarm SA, and plans to raise additional equity funds through utilizing its outstanding warrants. Following such efforts, on September 26, 2024, the Company entered into a Warrant Inducement Letter with an investor pursuant to which the Company issued 9,748,252 new warrants and reduced the exercise price of 4,874,126 warrant shares from 1.45 to 0.8701 to induce exercise and receive gross cash proceeds of 4,240,977 and on July 29, 2024 the Company s subsidiary Cosmofarm SA entered into an agreement with a third-party lender in the principal amount of 400,000 432,760). The Company additionally plans to file with the U.S. SEC a registration statement on Form S-1 for an offering of up to 7.5 million by the end of November 2024. Moreover, the Company s management is considering postponing certain repayments of suppliers and creditors. However, management cannot provide any assurances that the Company will be successful in accomplishing any of its plans. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to successfully accomplish the plans described herein and eventually secure other sources of financing and attain profitable operations. Considering the above, management is of the view that substantial doubt exists about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effect on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that may result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 46 Table of Contents Plan of Operation in the Next Twelve Months Specifically, our plan of operations for the next twelve months is as follows: We assess the foreseeable development of the Company as being positive. Over the medium term we expect to further expand our market share. However, during the course of further organizational optimization there may be associated extraordinary additional costs. Our plan for our own branded nutraceuticals is to enlarge our portfolio up to 150 SKUs by the end of 2023, including more basic line formulas to cover more customer needs of any age, advanced formulations, formulas based on herbs and further clinical studies with R D for further products. Our plan for geographic expansion in distributing and market penetration in the EU, Asia, USA and Canada is based on exclusive distributors, wholesalers, e-commerce, and development of franchising model, alliances and acquisitions of nutraceutical companies. In addition, our plan for branded pharmaceuticals is geographic expansion across the world, especially in the EU and UK, as well as in other countries with fast registration and developed markets with liberalized OTC policies for online pharmacies and supermarkets. We also intend to enhance our exclusive distribution rights with a growing basis of cooperating partners whilst purchasing generic, biosimilar drugs and OTC licenses. We also intend to enhance our product expectance by registered copyrights and trademarks in all OTC drugs. In addition, we remain committed to strategic research and development across each business unit with a particular focus on assets with inherently lower risk profiles and clearly defined governmental regulatory pathways. Our plan for our full line wholesale is to expand in the Greek territory, enlarge our customer portfolio and integrate of established sales network of pharmacies through the use of B2B and B2C e-commerce platforms and exclusive distributors. We are also aiming in increasing the exports of branded pharmaceuticals as we focus on higher profit margins categories (OTC and VMS), deliver 3PL (third-party logistics) services to pharma companies, put in force loyalty programs, provide added value services to pharmacies and emergency deliveries to VIP customers. The Company will evaluate and, where appropriate, execute on opportunities to expand its network of pharmacies and products in areas that it believes will offer above average growth characteristics and attractive margins. The Company is growing its business through organic growth, market penetration, geographic expansion and acquisitions which would add value to its business and its shareholders. The Company is also committed to pursuing various forms of business development; this can include trading, alliances, joint ventures and dispositions. Moreover, it hopes to continue to build on its portfolio of pharmaceutical products and expand its OTC and nutraceutical product portfolio. Thus, the Company is developing a sound sales distribution network specializing in its own branded nutraceutical products. The Company s main objective is expanding the business operations of its subsidiaries by concentrating its efforts on becoming an international pharmaceutical Company. The Company views its business development activity as an enabler of its strategies, and it seeks to generate earnings growth and enhance shareholder value by pursuing a disciplined, strategic, and financial approach to evaluating business development opportunities. Under these principles the Company assesses businesses and assets as part of its regular, ongoing portfolio review process and continues to consider trading development activities for its businesses. The Company s objective is the optimization of operating expenses across all entities without compromising the quality of the Company s services and products. Changes in the behavior and spending patterns of purchasers of pharmaceutical and healthcare products and services, including delaying medical procedures, rationing prescription medications, reducing the frequency of doctor visits, and foregoing healthcare insurance coverage, may impact the Company s business. The pharmaceutical sector offers a large growth potential within the European pharmaceutical market if service, price and quality are strictly directed towards the customer requirements. The Company will continue to encounter competition in the market by product, service, reliability, and a high level of quality. On the procurement side, the Company can access a wide range of supply possibilities. To minimize business risks, the Company diversifies its sources of supply all over Europe. It secures its high-quality demands through careful supplier qualification and selection, as well as active suppliers system management. 47 Table of Contents Strategic Plan Our strategic plan, which strikes a balance between growth and sustainability, emphasizes synergies, vertical integration, operational efficiencies, R D, brand expansion, and the global growth of our distribution network and facilities. We intend to continue to pursue active ongoing acquisitions. In fact, many of our acquisitions entail exploring opportunities, with discounted assets through business combinations or joint ventures, all to enhance our distribution network. We will expand our R D division which is a platform and incubator to develop new patented pharmaceuticals and proprietary innovative nutraceutical products. To foster organic growth, we will enhance our business development and marketing efforts, pursue global expansion via prominent retailers, pharmacies and e-commerce platforms, and recapture lost markets such as the infant and baby care categories. In addition, we will invest in the expansion of our production capacity and global network of facilities to boost sales of our brands, engage in contract manufacturing with large multinational pharmaceutical companies, produce pharma grade ethanol for hospitals, and expand into new large markets capitalizing on our comparative advantages. Last but not least, we aim to strategically invest in key personnel, from seasoned export managers to highly skilled scientists, to ensure we have the necessary expertise at our fingertips. Organic Growth Proprietary Portfolio of Branded Products: A bright spot so far in 2024 is the strong demand for our branded nutraceuticals, as we aspire to transform them into global brands. Our products have received very positive feedback at leading events like Arab Health in Dubai, Infarma in Barcelona, Vitafoods in Geneva, and Pharmacy Show in Birmingham. Sky Premium Life : We are selling Sky Premium Life products in an increasing number of countries through pharmacies, retail chains, and online platforms. Among our prominent retailers is Holland Barrett, with over 1,600 stores in 18 countries across the world, it is not only Europe's largest health and wellbeing retailer but also one of the world's largest, generating about 1 billion in annual revenue. Additionally, our products are available online through platforms like eBay and Amazon in the UK, Canada, the US, Germany, France, Spain, and Singapore. We are investing in our infrastructure, expanding our production capacity to accommodate increasing volumes, accelerating our efforts to broaden our distribution network, and planning to penetrate new major markets. This is boosted by strategic collaborations like the one announced with C.A. PAPAELLINAS Group, a market leader with an extensive distribution network throughout Cyprus. PAPAELLINAS will represent and distribute Sky Premium Life, not only in Holland Barrett stores but also in pharmacies throughout Cyprus. Mediterranation : Building upon the success of Sky Premium Life, we also launched Mediterranation, our premium food supplements brand. Inspired by the Mediterranean way of life, renowned for its healthy food, sunny climate, and longevity, Mediterranation utilizes organic herbs and plant extracts, such as dittany of Crete, oregano, mastic, and kritamos from the Mediterranean region. All of our products are manufactured under strict pharmaceutical standards and adhere to GMP protocols. Bio-Bebe and C-Sept /C-Scrub: Among Cana's many valuable assets, Cosmos Health also obtained a proprietary portfolio of pharmaceutical, dermocosmetic, antiseptic, and food supplement branded products. These include, among others: Bio-Bebe, an organic infant care and nutrition brand, which we are in the process of relaunching. This presents us with a great opportunity to enter the lucrative global baby food market that, according to Fortune Business Insights, is worth 102.90 billion per year. C-Sept, an antiseptic brand, which we are expanding with the launch of the new C-Scrub Wash 4 CHG Biocide. We are well positioned to capitalize on the global antiseptic and disinfectant market that, according to Grand View Research, is worth 29 billion per year. 48 Table of Contents While the Company intends to pursue these milestones, there may be circumstances where for valid business reasons or due to factors beyond the control of the Company, a reallocation of efforts may be necessary or advisable. The Company intends to spend the funds available to strengthen working capital, inventories, intangible assets, acquisitions, research and development, sales and marketing expenses. Due to the uncertain nature of the industry in which the Company operates, projects may be frequently reviewed and reassessed. Accordingly, while it is currently intended by management that the available funds will be expended as set forth above, actual expenditures may in fact differ from these amounts and allocations. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements As of September 30, 2024, there were no off-balance sheet arrangements. Critical Accounting Policies In December 2001, the SEC requested that all registrants list their most critical accounting polices under the Management s Discussion and Analysis section. The SEC indicated that a critical accounting policy is one which is both important to the portrayal of a company s financial condition and results, and requires management s most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Revenue Recognition: The Company adopted Topic 606 Revenue from Contracts with Customers on January 1, 2018. As a result, it has changed its accounting policy for revenue recognition as detailed in Note 2. Foreign Currency. Assets and liabilities of all foreign operations are translated at period-end rates of exchange, and the statements of operations are translated at the average rates of exchange for the period. Gains or losses resulting from translating foreign currency financial statements are accumulated in a separate component of stockholders equity until the entity is sold or substantially liquidated. Gains or losses from foreign currency transactions (transactions denominated in a currency other than the entity s local currency) are included in net (loss) earnings. Income Taxes. The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method, as required by the accounting standard for income taxes, ASC 740. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis, as well as net operating loss carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. The Company is liable for income taxes in Greece and the United Kingdom. The corporate income tax rate is 22 in Greece (tax losses are carried forward for five years effective January 1, 2013) and 25 in United Kingdom. Losses may also be subject to limitation under certain rules regarding change of ownership. We regularly review deferred tax assets to assess their potential realization and establish a valuation allowance for portions of such assets to reduce the carrying value if we do not consider it to be more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized. Our review includes evaluating both positive (e.g., sources of taxable income) and negative (e.g., recent historical losses) evidence that could impact the realizability of our deferred tax assets. 49 Table of Contents We recognize the impact of an uncertain tax position in our financial statements if, in management s judgment, the position is not more-likely-than-not sustainable upon audit based on the position s technical merits. This involves the identification of potential uncertain tax positions, the evaluation of applicable tax laws and an assessment of whether a liability for an uncertain tax position is necessary. We operate and are subject to audit in multiple taxing jurisdictions. We record interest and penalties related to income taxes as a component of interest and other expense as incurred, respectively. Potential benefits of income tax losses are not recognized in the accounts until realization is more likely than not. The Company has adopted ASC 740 Accounting for Income Taxes as of its inception. Pursuant to ASC 740, the Company is required to compute tax asset benefits for net operating losses carried forward. The potential benefits of net operating losses have not been recognized in this financial statement because the Company cannot be assured it is more likely than not it will utilize the net operating losses carried forward in future years. The Company has net operating loss carry-forwards in our parent, Cosmos Health Inc., which are applicable to future taxable income in the United States (if any). Additionally, the Company has income tax liabilities in the United Kingdom. The income tax assets and liabilities are not able to be netted. We therefore reserve the income tax assets applicable to the United States but recognize the income tax liabilities in Greece and the United Kingdom. Losses may also be subject to limitation under certain rules regarding change of ownership. Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Credit Losses The Company follows ASC 310 to estimate the allowance for doubtful accounts. Pursuant to FASB ASC paragraph 310-10-35-9, losses from uncollectible receivables shall be accrued when both of the following conditions are met: (a) information available before the financial statements are issued or are available to be issued (as discussed in Section 855-10-25) indicates that it is probable that an asset has been impaired at the date of the financial statements, and (b) the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Those conditions may be considered in relation to individual receivables or in relation to groups of similar types of receivables. If the conditions are met, accrual shall be made even though the receivables that are uncollectible may not be identifiable. The Company reviews individually each trade receivable for collectability and performs on-going credit evaluations of its customers and adjusts credit limits based upon payment history and the customer s current credit worthiness, as determined by the review of their current credit information; and determines the allowance for doubtful accounts based on historical write-off experience, customer specific facts and general economic conditions that may affect a client s ability to pay. Bad debt expense is included in general and administrative expenses, if any. Inventory Reserves Our merchandise inventories are made up of finished goods and are valued at the lower of cost or market using the weighted-average cost method. Average cost includes the direct purchase price, net of vendor allowances and cash discounts, of merchandise inventory. We record valuation reserves on an annual basis for merchandise damage and defective returns, merchandise items with slow-moving or obsolescence exposure and merchandise that has a carrying value that exceeds market value. These reserves are estimates of a reduction in value to reflect inventory valuation at the lower of cost or market. The reserve for merchandise returns is based upon the determination of the historical net realizable value of products sold from our returned goods inventory or returned to vendors for credit. Our reserve for merchandise returns includes amounts for returned product on-hand as well as for new merchandise on-hand that we estimate will ultimately become returned goods inventory after being sold based on historical return rates. 50 Table of Contents Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. Not applicable. A smaller reporting company is not required to provide the information required by this Item. Item 4. Controls and Procedures. Disclosure Controls and Procedures The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act) that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the Company s Securities Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including its Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures The Company s management, with the participation of the Company s Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon that evaluation, the Principal Executive Officer and the Principal Financial Officer have concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were ineffective due to material weaknesses stated below: The Company has a lack of proper segregation of duties. The Company s internal control structure lacks multiple levels of review and oversight and does not have appropriate IT General Controls (ITGCs) for the applications used in the Financial Reporting process, caused by lack of design of relevant controls and overall IT risk management. We are in the process of remediating all material weaknesses present in our internal controls and we plan to have completed the remediation by December 31, 2024. - The Company has a lack of proper segregation of duties. We are in the process of updating the organizational chart in order to reallocate roles among personnel and emphasize sharing the responsibilities of key business processes by distributing the discrete functions of these processes to multiple people and departments. - The Company s internal control structure lacks multiple levels of review and oversight and does not have appropriate IT General Controls (ITGCs) for the applications used in the Financial Reporting process, caused by lack of design of relevant controls and overall IT risk management. We are in the process of developing multiple levels of review based on job responsibilities and level of personnel. For example, management reviews whether the bank reconciliations are being prepared on a timely basis by the preparer and whether there are discrepancies between the general ledger and the bank statements. Another example is the review of management accounting information by the CFO and his authorization for material transactions and adjustments. Furthermore, we are in the process of assessing a new financial reporting application that will be used by all the companies of the Group and would be able to support, process financially relevant information, provide financially relevant reporting and house financially relevant interfaces and application controls in order for us to more efficiently establish IT General Controls to a single and more reliable application. 51 Table of Contents Changes in Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Our Audit Committee is in the process of evaluating our existing controls and procedures, while communicating with the Management on quarterly basis. Audit Committee We have a separately designated standing audit committee, which is appointed by the Board of Directors of Cosmos Health Inc. On April 28, 2022, Dr. Anastasios Aslidis was elected to serve on the Board of Directors and was appointed as a chair of the Audit Committee. Our three independent directors, Anastasios Aslidis, John Hoidas and Demetrios Demetriades serve on the Audit Committee. The primary function of the committee is to assist the Board of Directors in overseeing (1) the financial reporting and accounting processes of the Company, and (2) the financial statements audits of the Company. The Committee also prepares a written report to be included in the annual proxy statement of the Company pursuant to the applicable rules and regulations of the SEC . In furtherance of these purposes, the Committee shall maintain direct communication among the Company s independent auditors and the Board of Directors. The independent auditors and any other registered public accounting firm engaged in preparing or issuing an audit report or performing other audit review or attest services for the Company shall report directly to the Committee and are ultimately accountable to the Committee and the Board of Directors. In discharging its oversight role, the Committee is authorized to investigate any matter brought to its attention with full access to all books, records, facilities and personnel of the Company. The Committee shall have the sole authority to retain at the Company s expense outside legal, accounting or other advisors to advise the Committee and to receive appropriate funding, as determined by the Committee, from the Company for the payment of the compensation of such advisors and for the payment of ordinary administrative expenses of the Committee that are necessary to carry out its duties.

The Committee may also meet with the Company s investment bankers or financial analysts who follow the Company. The Committee shall meet no less frequently than four times per year, with additional meetings as circumstances warrant.
