 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our contract assets increased by million and our contract liabilities decreased million primarily due to the timing of milestone billings for projects in our Subsea product line. The noncurrent portion of contract assets is recorded on the consolidated balance sheets as other long-term assets. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized million of revenue that was included in the contract liabilities balance at the beginning of the period.

 million of cash and million shares of the Company s common stock, which was subject to customary purchase price adjustments. In connection with the closing, to fund the cash portion of the purchase price, the Company borrowed million under its senior secured asset-based lending facility Credit Facility on January 2, 2024 and entered into a million second lien seller term loan credit agreement Seller Term Loan on January 4, 2024. In March 2024, in connection with the finalization of working capital adjustments, the principal amount of the Seller Term Loan was reduced by million. During the quarter, the Company finalized the purchase price allocation resulting in an adjustment to goodwill of million. Adjustments primarily related to deferred income taxes. 
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recognized acquisition-related costs of million and million, respectively, for consulting fees and other costs expensed as transaction expenses. The acquisition of business on the statement of cash flow is presented net of the cash and cash equivalents acquired. 
 The following table summarizes the fair value of identified assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition. The allocation of consideration transferred is based on management's estimates, judgments and assumptions. Management estimated that consideration paid exceeded the fair value of the net assets acquired. Therefore, goodwill of million was recorded, most of which is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes. The Company has estimated the useful lives of customer relationships, backlog and trade names as approximately , and , respectively. 
 Accounts receivable trade Inventories Property and equipment Intangible assets Prepaid expenses and other assets Total assets acquired Current liabilities Long-term liabilities Total liabilities assumed Total identifiable net assets acquired Goodwill Total purchase consideration 
 The excess of the total equity value of Variperm based on the purchase consideration over net assets acquired was recorded as goodwill. The goodwill is primarily attributable to revenue synergies and assembled workforce expected to be realized from the acquisition. Intangible assets acquired as a result of the Variperm Acquisition are amortized on a straight-line basis to reflect the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible assets are realized. Acquired goodwill and intangibles relate to our Downhole reporting unit and Downhole asset group.

 In August 2024, we redeemed million in aggregate principal amount of our 2025 Notes for million. The net carrying value of the extinguished debt, including amortized debt discount and debt issuance costs, was million, resulting in a million loss on extinguishment of debt. 
 Seller Term Loan 
 On January 4, 2024, the Company entered into the Seller Term Loan in connection with the closing of the Variperm Acquisition, which had an initial principal amount of million and matures in December 2026. In March 2024, in connection with the finalization of purchase price adjustments, the principal amount of the Seller Term Loan was reduced by million. The Seller Term Loan bears interest at the rate of (i) per year for the period commencing on the Closing Date to (but excluding) the first anniversary of the Closing Date, (ii) per annum for the period commencing on the first anniversary of the Closing Date to (but excluding) the second anniversary of the Closing Date and (iii) per annum for the period commencing on the second anniversary of the Closing Date to (but excluding) the maturity date. The Company has an option to prepay the Seller Term Loan anytime without premium or penalty. 
 The Seller Term Loan requires the Company to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio of at least to 1.00 as of the last day of each fiscal quarter commencing at the time excess availability is less than the greater of (x) of the Line Cap and (y) million and continuing until excess availability exceeds the greater of (x) of the Line Cap and (y) million for consecutive days. Line Cap has the meaning set forth in the Credit Facility. 
 Subject to customary exceptions, all obligations under the Seller Term Loan are guaranteed, jointly and severally, by our wholly owned U.S. and Canadian subsidiaries and are secured by substantially all assets of each such entity and the Company, subject to customary exclusions pursuant to certain intercreditor arrangements. 
 The Seller Term Loan also contains customary representations and warranties and affirmative and negative covenants, as well as customary events of default, with corresponding grace periods, including, without limitation, payment defaults, cross-defaults to other agreements evidencing indebtedness and bankruptcy-related defaults.

 days prior to the maturity of 2025 Notes (which will not apply if the 2025 Notes are repaid prior to such 91st day) and (c) the date that is days prior to the maturity of the Seller Term Loan if the outstanding aggregate principal amount thereunder is equal to or greater than million. Th e Credit Facility provides revolving credit commitments of million (with a sublimit of up to million available for the issuance of letters of credit for the account of the Company and certain of its domestic subsidiaries) (the U.S. Line ), of which up to million is available to certain of our Canadian subsidiaries for loans in U.S. or Canadian dollars (with a sublimit of up to million available for the issuance of letters of credit for the account of our Canadian subsidiaries) (the Canadian Line ). Lender commitments under the Credit Facility, subject to certain limitations, may be increased by an additional million . 
 Availability under the Credit Facility is subject to a borrowing base calculated by reference to eligible accounts receivable in the U.S., Canada and certain other jurisdictions (subject to a cap) and eligible inventory in the U.S. and Canada. Our borrowing capacity under the Credit Facility could be reduced or eliminated, depending on future fluctuations in our receivables and inventory. As of September 30, 2024, our total borrowing base was million, of which million amount was drawn and million was used as security for outstanding letters of credit, resulting in remaining availability of million. 
 Borrowings under the U.S. Line bear interest at a rate equal to, at our option, either (a) the Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR ), subject to a floor of , plus a margin of to , or (b) a base rate plus a margin of to , in each case based upon the Company's quarterly total net leverage ratio. The U.S. Line base rate is determined by reference to the greatest of (i) the federal funds rate plus per annum, (ii) the one-month adjusted term SOFR plus per annum, and (iii) the prime rate of interest announced by Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, subject to a floor of . 
 Borrowings under the Canadian Line bear interest at a rate equal to, at our Canadian borrowers option, either (a) Canadian Overnight Repo Rate Average CORRA ), subject to a floor of , plus a margin of to , or (b) a base rate plus a margin of to , in each case based upon the Company's quarterly net leverage ratio. The Canadian Line base rate is determined by reference to the greater of (i) the one-month CORRA plus per annum and (ii) the prime rate for Canadian dollar commercial loans made in Canada as reported by Thomson Reuters, subject to a floor of . 
 The weighted average interest rate under the Credit Facility was approximately and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 The Credit Facility also provides for a commitment fee in the amount of (a) on the unused portion of revolving commitments if average usage of the Credit Facility is greater than and (b) on the unused portion of revolving commitments if average usage of the Credit Facility is less than or equal to . 
 If excess availability under the Credit Facility falls below the greater of of the borrowing base and million, we will be required to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio of at least :1.00 as of the end of each fiscal quarter until excess availability under the Credit Facility exceeds such threshold for consecutive days. 
 Subject to customary exceptions, all obligations under the Credit Facility are guaranteed, jointly and severally, by our wholly-owned U.S. subsidiaries and, in the case of the Canadian Line, our wholly-owned Canadian subsidiaries, and are secured by substantially all assets of each such entity and the Company, subject to customary exclusions. 
 The Credit Facility contains various covenants that, among other things, limit our ability (none of which are absolute) to incur additional indebtedness or issue certain preferred shares, grant certain liens, make certain loans and investments, pay dividends, make distributions or make other restricted payments, enter into mergers or acquisitions unless certain conditions are satisfied, change our lines of business, prepay certain indebtedness, enter into certain affiliate transactions or engage in certain asset dispositions. 
 If an event of default exists under the Credit Facility, the lenders will have the right to accelerate the maturity of the obligations outstanding under the Credit Facility and exercise other rights and remedies. Obligations outstanding under the Credit Facility, however, will be automatically accelerated upon an event of default arising from a bankruptcy or insolvency event. An event of default includes, among other things, nonpayment of principal, interest, fees or other amounts within certain grace periods; representations and warranties proving to be untrue in any material respect; failure to perform or otherwise comply with covenants in the Credit Facility or other loan documents, subject, in certain instances, to grace periods; cross-defaults to certain other indebtedness if such

 Senior Secured Bonds due 2029 
 On October 24, 2024, we priced an issuance (the Offering of million aggregate principal amount of senior secured bonds due 2029 (the 2029 Bonds ). We expect to use the net proceeds from the Offering, together with cash on hand, to redeem in full all outstanding 2025 Notes and to repay all borrowings outstanding under the Seller Term Loan. The Offering is expected to close on November 7, 2024, subject to customary closing conditions. 
 Other Debt 
 Other debt consists of various finance leases of equipment. 
 Letters of Credit and Guarantees 
 We execute letters of credit in the normal course of business to secure the delivery of product from specific vendors and also to guarantee our fulfillment of performance obligations relating to certain large contracts. The Company had million and million in total outstanding letters of credit as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.

 million and million, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company recorded a tax expense of million and million, respectively. The estimated annual effective tax rates for all periods were impacted by losses in jurisdictions where the recording of a tax benefit is not available. Furthermore, the tax expense or benefit recorded can vary from period to period depending on the Company s relative mix of earnings and losses by jurisdiction. Finally, the Company believes that it is reasonably possible that a decrease of approximately million of noncurrent unrecognized tax benefits may occur by the end of 2024 as a result of a lapse of the statute of limitations. 
 The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development introduced Base Erosion and Profit Shifting Pillar 2 rules that impose a global minimum tax rate of 15 . Numerous countries, including European Union member states, have enacted, or are expected to enact, legislation to be effective January 1, 2024 with general implementation of a global minimum tax by January 1, 2025. Based on current enacted legislation, we do not expect a material impact on our future effective tax rate. 
 We have deferred tax assets related to net operating loss and other tax carryforwards in the U.S. and in certain states and foreign jurisdictions. We recognize deferred tax assets to the extent that we believe these assets are more likely than not to be realized. In making such a determination, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including, but not limited to, our recent history of pretax losses over the prior three year period, the goodwill and intangible asset impairments for various reporting units, the future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, the projected future taxable income or loss and tax-planning. We believe that there is a reasonable possibility that within the next 12 months, a portion of the valuation allowance will no longer be needed. Release of the valuation allowance would result in the recognition of certain deferred tax assets and a decrease to income tax expense for the period the release is recorded. However, the exact timing and amount of the valuation allowance release are subject to change on the basis of the level of profitability that we are able to actually achieve. As of September 30, 2024, we do not anticipate being able to fully utilize all of the losses prior to their expiration in the following jurisdictions: the U.S., the U.K., Germany, Singapore, China and Saudi Arabia. As a result, we have certain valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets as of September 30, 2024.

 million and million borrowings outstanding under the Credit Facility and Seller Term Loan as of September 30, 2024. The Credit Facility incurs interest at a variable interest rate, and therefore, the carrying amount approximates fair value. The Company has an option to prepay the Seller Term Loan anytime without premium or penalty, therefore, the carrying amount approximates fair value. The fair value of the debt is classified as a Level 2 measurement because interest rates charged are similar to other financial instruments with similar terms and maturities. 
 The fair value of our 2025 Notes is estimated using Level 2 inputs in the fair value hierarchy and is based on quoted prices for those or similar instruments. At September 30, 2024, the fair value and the carrying value of our 2025 Notes approximated million and million, respectively. At December 31, 2023, the fair value and the carrying value of our 2025 Notes approximated million and million, respectively. 
 There were no other significant outstanding financial instruments as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 that required measuring the amounts at fair value on a recurring basis. We did not change our valuation techniques associated with recurring fair value measurements from prior periods, and there were no transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy during the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

 reportable segments: (1) Drilling and Completions and (2) Artificial Lift and Downhole. Our historical results of operations were recast retrospectively to reflect these changes in accordance with U.S. GAAP. 
 The Drilling and Completions segment designs, manufactures and supplies products and solutions to the drilling, subsea, coiled tubing, well stimulation and intervention markets, including applications in oil and natural gas, renewable energy, defense and communications. The Artificial Lift and Downhole segment designs, manufactures and supplies products and solutions for the artificial lift, production and infrastructure markets. 
 The Company s reportable segments are strategic units that offer distinct products and services. They are managed separately since each business segment requires different marketing strategies. Operating segments have not been aggregated as part of a reportable segment. The Company evaluates the performance of its reportable segments based on operating income. This segmentation is representative of the manner in which our Chief Operating Decision Maker and our board of directors make decisions on how to allocate resources and assess performance. We consider the Chief Operating Decision Maker to be the Chief Executive Officer. 
 The amounts indicated below as Corporate relate to costs and assets not allocated to the reportable segments.

 Overview 
 We are a global manufacturing company serving the oil, natural gas, industrial and renewable energy industries. With headquarters in Houston, Texas, FET provides value added solutions aimed at improving the safety, efficiency, and environmental impact of our customers operations. Our highly engineered products include capital equipment and consumable products. FET s customers include oil and natural gas operators, land and offshore drilling contractors, oilfield service companies, pipeline and refinery operators, and renewable and new energy companies. Consumable products are used by our customers in drilling, well construction and completion activities and at processing centers and refineries. Our capital products are directed at drilling rig equipment for constructing new or upgrading existing rigs, subsea construction and development projects, pressure pumping equipment, the placement of production equipment on new producing wells, downstream capital projects and capital equipment for renewable energy projects. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, approximately 80 of our revenue was derived from consumable products and activity-based equipment, while the balance was primarily derived from capital products with a small amount from rental and other services. 
 We expect that the world s long-term energy demand will continue to rise for many decades. We also expect hydrocarbons will continue to play a vital role in meeting the world s long-term energy needs while renewable energy sources develop to scale. As such, we remain focused on serving our customers in both oil and natural gas as well as renewable energy applications. We are continuing to develop products to help oil and gas operators lower expenses, increase production and reduce their emissions while also deploying our technologies in renewable energy applications. 
 In the first quarter 2024, following the Variperm Acquisition, we aligned our reportable segments with business activity drivers, our customer base, and the manner in which management reviews and evaluates operating performance. FET now operates in the following two reportable segments: (1) Drilling and Completions and (2) Artificial Lift and Downhole. Refer to Note 10 Business Segments for the product lines making up each segment. Our historical results of operations were recast retrospectively to reflect these changes in accordance with U.S. GAAP. 
 22 

A summary of the products and services offered by each segment is as follows: 
 Drilling and Completions . This segment designs, manufactures and supplies products and solutions to the drilling, subsea, coiled tubing, well stimulation and intervention markets, including applications in the oil and natural gas, renewable energy, defense and communications industries. The products and solutions consist primarily of (i) capital equipment and consumable products used in the drilling process; (ii) capital equipment and aftermarket products including subsea remotely operated vehicles ROVs and trenchers, submarine rescue vehicles, specialty components and tooling, and technical services; (iii) capital equipment and consumable products sold to the pressure pumping market, including hydraulic fracturing pumps, cooling systems, and high-pressure flexible hoses and flow iron; (iv) wireline cable and pressure control equipment used in the well completion and intervention service markets; and (v) coiled tubing strings and pressure control equipment used in coiled tubing operations, as well as coiled line pipe and related services. 
 Artificial Lift and Downhole . This segment designs, manufactures and supplies products and solutions for the artificial lift, well construction, production and infrastructure markets. The products and solutions consist primarily of: (i) products designed to safeguard artificial lift equipment and downhole cables; (ii) well construction casing and cementing equipment; (iii) customized downhole technology solutions, providing sand and flow control products for heavy oil applications; (iv) engineered process systems, production equipment, as well as specialty separation equipment; and (v) a wide range of industrial valves focused on oil and natural gas as well as power generation, renewable energy and other general industrial applications. 
 Market Conditions 
 Generally, demand for our products and services is directly related to our customers capital and operating budgets. These budgets are heavily influenced by current and expected energy prices. In addition, demand for our capital products is driven by the utilization of service company equipment. Utilization is a function of equipment capacity and durability in demanding environments. 
 Compared to 2023 full year average prices, oil and natural gas average prices have remained relatively flat despite tightened supply from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries ("OPEC+") production cuts and continued geopolitical tensions in Ukraine and the Middle East. These tensions could lead to a disruption to world energy markets and international supply chains. Although these near-term macroeconomic events have presented challenges, we expect that the world s long-term energy demand will continue to rise and may outpace global supply. We expect that hydrocarbons will continue to play a vital role in meeting the world s long-term energy needs while renewable energy sources become increasingly prominent. 
 Average West Texas Intermediate WTI and Brent oil prices were lower in the third quarter 2024 compared to the third quarter 2023. In addition, average natural gas prices were lower in the third quarter 2024 compared to the third quarter 2023. The decline in average prices during the third quarter 2024 can be attributed to lower global demand outlook than previously projected and anticipated increases in production by OPEC+. 
 Our revenues, over the long-term, are highly correlated to the global drilling rig count, which decreased 3.1 during the third quarter 2024 compared to average global rig count during third quarter 2023. The decrease was mainly driven by a decline in U.S. rig count of 9.7 . In the U.S., publicly owned exploration and production companies are expected to continue to exercise disciplined capital spending while privately owned exploration and production companies fluctuate their activity in response to changes in oil and natural gas prices. Activity levels in the U.S. are forecasted to remain depressed in the fourth quarter of 2024 and into 2025 while international growth is expected to decline.

Revenue 
 Our revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 207.8 million, an increase of 28.6 million, or 15.9 , compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, our Drilling and Completions and our Artificial Lift and Downhole segments comprised 59.5 and 40.5 of our total revenue, respectively, compared to 66.3 and 33.7 of our total revenue, respectively, for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The overall increase in revenue is primarily related to the revenue contributed from the acquired Variperm business, and increased revenues in the Subsea and the Stimulation and Intervention product lines, partially offset by the decline in U.S. drilling activity and lower revenues in the Production Equipment product line in the third quarter 2024 compared to the third quarter 2023. The changes in revenue by operating segment consisted of the following: 
 Drilling and Completions segment Revenue was 123.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 4.7 million, or 3.9 , compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was driven by an increase of 6.2 million, or 41.7 , in our Subsea product line from higher project revenue recognized from ROVs and Launch and Recovery Systems ("LARS"); and, a 5.5 million, or 16.9 , increase in our Stimulation and Intervention product line, primarily due to higher sales of power ends and wireline cable. Partially offsetting this increase were a 6.0 million, or 14.3 , decrease in our Drilling product line primarily due to the decline in U.S. drilling activity and a 1.0 million, or 3.4 , decrease in our Coiled Tubing product line from lower international activity. 
 Artificial Lift and Downhole segment Revenue was 84.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 23.9 million, or 39.5 , compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. Revenue for our Downhole product line increased by 27.1 million, or 115.3 , primarily due to revenue contributed from the acquired Variperm business. Partially offsetting this increase was a 3.7 million, or 17.2 decrease, in the Production Equipment product line primarily due to a decline in demand for surface production equipment. 
 Segment operating income (loss) and segment operating margin percentage 
 Segment operating income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 9.4 million, a 3.9 million increase compared to an income of 5.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, segment operating margin percentage was 4.5 compared to 3.1 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Segment operating margin percentage is calculated by dividing segment operating income (loss) by revenue for the period. The change in operating income (loss) for each segment is explained as follows: 
 Drilling and Completions segment Segment operating income was 7.0 million, or 5.7 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to operating income of 3.9 million, or 3.3 , for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The 3.2 million increase in segment operating results is primarily attributable to higher volume and profitability in the Subsea and the Stimulation and Intervention product lines, partially offset by lower operating leverage on lower sales volumes of our drilling products. 
 Artificial Lift and Downhole segment Segment operating income was 10.8 million, or 12.8 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to an income of 8.5 million, or 14.1 , for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The 2.3 million increase was primarily driven by the acquisition of Variperm, partially offset by the decline in operating leverage on lower sales volumes of our surface production equipment. 
 Corporate Selling, general and administrative expenses for Corporate were 8.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 6.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was primarily related to higher variable compensation costs and professional fees. Corporate costs include, among other items, payroll related costs for management, administration, finance, legal, and human resources personnel; professional fees for legal, accounting and related services; and marketing costs. 
 Other items not included in segment operating income (loss) 
 Transaction expenses, gain (loss) on the disposal of assets and other are not included in segment operating income, but are included in total operating income. 
 26 

Other income and expense 
 Other income and expense includes interest expense, foreign exchange gains (losses) and other, and loss on extinguishment of debt. We incurred 7.7 million of interest expense during the three months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 3.1 million compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, due to the increased borrowings under our revolving Credit Facility and borrowings under the Seller Term Loan entered into in connection with the Variperm Acquisition. See Note 7 Debt for further details related to the Credit Facility and Seller Term Loan. 
 The foreign exchange gains (losses) are primarily the result of movements in the British pound, Euro and Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar. These movements in exchange rates create foreign exchange gains or losses when applied to monetary assets or liabilities denominated in currencies other than the location s functional currency, primarily U.S. dollar denominated cash, trade account receivables and net intercompany receivable balances for our entities using a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar. 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we redeemed an aggregate 60.0 million of principal amount of our 9.00 convertible secured notes due August 2025 2025 Notes at par value. The net carrying value of the extinguished debt, including unamortized debt discount and debt issuance costs, was 58.2 million, resulting in a 1.8 million loss on extinguishment of debt. 
 Taxes 
 We recorded tax expense of 4.6 million and 1.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The estimated annual effective tax rates for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were impacted by losses in jurisdictions where the recording of a tax benefit is not available. Furthermore, the tax expense or benefit recorded can vary from period to period depending on the Company s relative mix of earnings and losses by jurisdiction.

Revenue 
 Our revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 615.4 million, an increase of 61.7 million, or 11.2 , compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our Drilling and Completions and our Artificial Lift and Downhole segments comprised 58.4 and 41.6 of our total revenue, respectively, compared to 67.9 and 32.1 of our total revenue, respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The overall increase in revenue is primarily related to the revenue contributed from the acquired Variperm business and increased revenues in the Subsea product line, partially offset by the decline in U.S. drilling and completions activity in 2024 compared to 2023. The changes in revenue by operating segment consisted of the following: 
 Drilling and Completions segment Revenue was 359.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 16.3 million, or 4.3 , compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in segment revenue included a 19.2 million, or 15.1 , decrease from the Drilling product line, a 12.4 million, or 9.8 , decrease from the Stimulation and Intervention product line, and a 3.4 million, or 4.1 , decrease from the Coiled Tubing product line, primarily the result of declining U.S. drilling and completions activity. These decreases were partially offset by an increase of 18.6 million, or 45.6 , in our Subsea product line due to higher project revenue recognized from ROVs and LARS, and an increase in parts sales. 
 Artificial Lift and Downhole segment Revenue was 255.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 78.1 million, or 43.9 , compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Revenue for our Downhole product line increased by 87.1 million, or 126.7 , primarily due to revenue contributed from the acquired Variperm business and an increase in downhole equipment sales from increased international activity. This increase was partially offset by a 4.8 million, or 8.0 , decrease in surface production equipment and a 4.3 million, or 8.7 , decrease in sales of our valve products. 
 Segment operating income (loss) and segment operating margin percentage 
 Segment operating income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 27.9 million, a 8.8 million increase compared to 19.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, segment operating margin percentage was 4.5 compared to 3.4 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Segment operating margin percentage is calculated by dividing segment operating income by revenue for the period. The change in operating income for each segment is explained as follows: 
 Drilling and Completions segment Segment operating income was 14.5 million, or 4.0 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 15.5 million, or 4.1 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The 1.0 million decrease in segment operating results is primarily due to the overall decline in segment revenues. 
 Artificial Lift and Downhole segment Segment operating income was 36.0 million, or 14.1 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 24.1 million, or 13.6 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The 11.9 million increase in segment operating results was primarily driven by the acquisition of Variperm, partially offset by the decline in operating leverage on lower sales volumes of our surface production equipment. 
 Corporate Selling, general and administrative expenses for Corporate were 22.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 20.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was primarily related to higher variable compensation costs. Corporate costs include, among other items, payroll related costs for management, administration, finance, legal, and human resources personnel; professional fees for legal, accounting and related services; and marketing costs. 
 Other items not included in segment operating income (loss) 
 Transaction expenses, gain (loss) on the disposal of assets and other are not included in segment operating income, but are included in total operating income. 
 Other income and expense 
 Other income and expense includes interest expense, foreign exchange gains (losses) and other, and loss on extinguishment of debt. We incurred 25.1 million of interest expense during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 11.3 million compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, due to the increased borrowings under our revolving Credit Facility and borrowings under the Seller Term Loan entered into in connection with the Variperm Acquisition. See Note 7 Debt for further details related to the Credit Facility and Seller Term Loan. 
 29 

The foreign exchange gains (losses) are primarily the result of movements in the British pound, Euro and Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar. These movements in exchange rates create foreign exchange gains or losses when applied to monetary assets or liabilities denominated in currencies other than the location s functional currency, primarily U.S. dollar denominated cash, trade account receivables and net intercompany receivable balances for our entities using a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we retired an aggregate 73.0 million of principal amount of our 2025 Notes at approximately par value. The net carrying value of the extinguished debt, including unamortized debt discount and debt issuance costs, was 70.7 million , resulting in a 2.3 million loss on extinguishment of debt. 
 Taxes 
 We recorded tax expense of 10.6 million and 6.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The estimated annual effective tax rates for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were impacted by losses in jurisdictions where the recording of a tax benefit is not available. Furthermore, the tax expense or benefit recorded can vary from period to period depending on the Company s relative mix of earnings and losses by jurisdiction. 
 
 Liquidity and capital resources 
 Sources and uses of liquidity 
 Our internal sources of liquidity are cash on hand and cash flows from operations, while our primary external sources include trade credit, the Credit Facility, the 2025 Notes and the Seller Term Loan. Our primary uses of capital have been for inventory, sales on credit to our customers, maintenance and growth capital expenditures, debt repayments and the acquisition of Variperm. We continually monitor other potential capital sources, including equity and debt financing, to meet our investment and target liquidity requirements. Our future success and growth will be highly dependent on our ability to generate positive operating cash flow and access outside sources of capital. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 61.2 million principal amount of 2025 Notes outstanding, 109.0 million of borrowings under our revolving Credit Facility and 58.4 million principal amount of the Seller Term Loan outstanding. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we retired an aggregate 73.0 million of principal amount of our 2025 Notes, including the 60.0 million in aggregate principal amount of our 2025 Notes that we redeemed in August 2024. The remaining 2025 Notes mature in August 2025. The Credit Facility matures on the earliest of (a) September 8, 2028, (b) the date that is 91 days prior to the maturity of 2025 Notes (which will not apply if the 2025 Notes are repaid prior to such 91st day) and (c) the date that is 91 days prior to the maturity of the Seller Term Loan if the outstanding aggregate principal amount thereunder is equal to or greater than 30 million. The Seller Term Loan matures in December 2026. See Note 7 Debt for further details related to the terms for our debt arrangements. 
 On October 24, 2024, we priced an issuance of 100.0 million aggregate principal amount of the 2029 Bonds. We expect to use the net proceeds, together with cash on hand, to redeem in full all outstanding 2025 Notes and to repay all borrowings outstanding under the Seller Term Loan. The Offering is expected to close on November 7, 2024, subject to customary closing conditions. Refer to Note 7 Debt for additional information on the Offering. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of 33.3 million and 58.8 million of availability under the Credit Facility. We intend to use approximately 20 million of cash on hand and borrowings from our credit facility, together with the net proceeds from the issuance of the 2029 Bonds, to repay in full the 2025 Notes and the Seller Term Loan. We anticipate that our future working capital requirements for our operations will fluctuate directionally with revenues. Furthermore, availability under the Credit Facility will fluctuate directionally based on the level of our eligible accounts receivable and inventory subject to applicable sublimits. In addition, we expect total 2024 capital expenditures to be approximately 10.0 million, primarily for replacement of end of life machinery and equipment. 
 We expect our available cash on-hand, cash generated by operations, and estimated availability under the Credit Facility to be adequate to fund current operations during the next 12 months. In addition, based on existing market conditions and our expected liquidity needs, among other factors, we may use a portion of our cash flows from operations, proceeds from divestitures, securities offerings or other eligible capital to reduce outstanding debt or repurchase shares of our common stock under our repurchase program. 
 In November 2021, our board of directors approved a program for the repurchase of outstanding shares of our common stock with an aggregate purchase amount of up to 10.0 million. Shares may be repurchased under the 
 30 

program from time to time, in amounts and at prices that the company deems appropriate, subject to market and business conditions, applicable legal requirements and other considerations. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , we did not repurchase shares of our common stock and the remaining authorization under this program is 2.4 million. 
 In January 2024, we completed the Variperm Acquisition for consideration of approximately 150.0 million of cash (subject to customary purchase price adjustments) and 2.0 million shares of our common stock. We may pursue additional acquisitions in the future, which may be funded with cash and/or equity. 
 Our cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 are presented below (in millions): Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities 53.7 (3.1) Net cash used in investing activities (155.9) (4.2) Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities 89.4 (6.9) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash (0.1) 0.3 Net decrease in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash (12.9) (13.9) 
 Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities 
 Net cash provided by operating activities was 53.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to net cash used in operating activities of 3.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This improvement in operating cash flow usage is primarily attributable to changes in working capital which provided cash of 30.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to a use of cash of 36.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Net cash used in investing activities 
 Net cash used in investing activities was 155.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, mainly related to the Variperm Acquisition of 150.4 million, and to 5.7 million of capital expenditures. Net cash used in investing activities was 4.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, including 5.5 million of capital expenditures, partially offset by 1.3 million of proceeds from the sale of property and equipment. 
 Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities 
 Net cash provided by financing activities was 89.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 6.9 million of cash used in financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The change in net cash provided by financing activities primarily resulted from 109.0 million in borrowings from the revolving Credit Facility and 59.7 million from the Seller Term Loan, partially offset by the retirement of 2025 Notes of 73.0 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to a net zero of borrowings on the revolving Credit Facility during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Supplemental Guarantor Financial Information 
 The Company s 2025 Notes are guaranteed by our domestic subsidiaries which are 100 owned, directly or indirectly, by the Company. The guarantees are full and unconditional, joint and several. 
 The guarantees of the 2025 Notes are (i) pari passu in right of payment with all existing and future senior indebtedness of such guarantor, including all obligations under our Credit Facility and the Seller Term Loan; (ii) secured by certain collateral of such guarantor, subject to permitted liens under the indenture governing the 2025 Notes; (iii) effectively senior to all unsecured indebtedness of that guarantor, to the extent of the value of the collateral securing the 2025 Notes (after giving effect to the liens securing our Credit Facility and any other senior liens on the collateral); and (iv) senior in right of payment to any future subordinated indebtedness of that guarantor. 
 In the event of a bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganization of any of the non-guarantor subsidiaries of the 2025 Notes, the non-guarantor subsidiaries of such notes will pay the holders of their debt and their trade creditors before they will be able to distribute any of their assets to the Company or to any guarantors. 
 The 2025 Notes guarantees shall each be released upon (i) any sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of such guarantor (by merger, consolidation or otherwise) to a person that is not (either before or after giving effect to such transaction) the Company or a subsidiary, if the sale or other disposition does not violate the applicable provisions of the indenture governing such notes; (ii) any sale, exchange or transfer (by merger, 
 31 

consolidation or otherwise) of the equity interests of such guarantor after which the applicable guarantor is no longer a subsidiary, which sale, exchange or transfer does not violate the applicable provisions of the indenture governing such notes; (iii) legal or covenant defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the indenture governing such notes; or (iv) dissolution of such guarantor, provided no default or event of default has occurred that is continuing. 
 The obligations of each guarantor of the 2025 Notes under its guarantee will be limited to the maximum amount as will, after giving effect to all other contingent and fixed liabilities of such guarantor (including, without limitation, any guarantees under the Credit Facility) and any collections from or payments made by or on behalf of any other guarantor in respect of the obligations of such other guarantor under its guarantee or pursuant to its contribution obligations under the applicable indenture, result in the obligations of such guarantor under its guarantee not constituting a fraudulent conveyance, fraudulent preference or fraudulent transfer or otherwise reviewable transaction under applicable law. Nonetheless, in the event of the bankruptcy, insolvency or financial difficulty of a guarantor, such guarantor s obligations under its guarantee may be subject to review and avoidance under applicable fraudulent conveyance, fraudulent preference, fraudulent transfer and insolvency laws.
