The
second program which does not utilize the LungFit platform partially inhibits neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) in the brain
to treat neurological conditions. The first target indication is autism spectrum disorder ASD ). On June 15, 2023, the
Company announced that it has entered into an agreement with Yissum Research Development Company of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem,
LTD. (the University to acquire the commercial rights for nNOS inhibitors being developed for the treatment of ASD and
other neurological conditions. Currently, there are no FDA-approved therapies specifically for the treatment of ASD. Under the terms
of the agreement, Beyond Air will make payments to the University over the three-year period from the date of the agreement for pre-clinical
work. Also, the Company will pay a low single-digit royalty on net sales and certain one-time payments based on clinical, regulatory
and sales milestones. The Company expects this program to progress from preclinical to a phase 1 first-in-human clinical trial by the
end of 2025. 

The
Company s current product candidates will be subject to premarket reviews and approvals by the FDA, certification through the conduct
of a conformity assessment by a notified body in the European Union (the EU ), as well as comparable foreign regulatory
authorities reviews or approvals in other countries or regions.

million for the six months ended September 30,
2024, and has accumulated losses attributable to the stockholders of Beyond Air of 
 million. The Company had cash, cash equivalents
and marketable securities of 
 million as of September 30, 2024. Management
believes these factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to meet its obligations with cash on hand, however,
management believes this doubt is alleviated through plans for increased revenues and decreased expenditures, many of which have already
been implemented, enabling increased cash flows. The company has recently signed agreements with TrillaMed (providing access to Department of Defense and Veterans
Affairs hospitals), Healthcare Links (expanding access to group purchasing organizations and integrated delivery networks) and Business
Asia Consultants (accelerating global expansion) which will drive increased revenues. The company has implemented a capital conservation
strategy , reducing our back office footprint, reducing staffing
levels by over across the company, placing our VCAP study on hold pending future funding and adjusting our production forecasts. 
The Company expects an immediate benefit from these actions. 

Management is confident that the efforts it has implemented
to increase revenues and decrease expenditures, while not assured, will enable the Company to meet its obligations. 

The Company s future capital needs and the adequacy of its available
funds will depend on many factors, including, but not necessarily limited to, the success and costs of commercialization of the Company s
approved product and the actual cost and time necessary for current and anticipated preclinical studies, clinical trials and other actions
needed to obtain certification or regulatory approval of the Company s product candidates. 

On
September 27, 2024, Beyond Air entered into a binding term sheet for a secured loan with certain lenders including its Chief Executive
Officer Steven Lisi and director Robert Carey. The Term Sheet was approved by each of the Company s independent and disinterested
directors, following the receipt of a recommendation from an independent investment bank. The Term Sheet provides for the following expected
terms: . (See Note 14) 

On
September 26, 2024, the Company, entered into a securities purchase agreement (the Securities Purchase Agreement II with certain institutional and accredited investors, including certain directors and officers of the Company. Pursuant to the
purchase agreement, the Company sold to the investors in a private placement offering, an aggregate of 
shares of Common Stock , at a purchase price of 
per Share, (ii) pre-funded warrants to purchase up to shares of common stock at a purchase price of per
pre-funded warrant and (iii) warrants to purchase up to shares of common stock, for aggregate for gross proceeds of
 
million (which includes 
million from related parties). Each share and each pre-funded warrant was sold with an accompanying common warrant to purchase one
share of common stock. The pre-funded warrants have an exercise price of per share, and the common warrants have an exercise
price of per share. Members of the Board of Directors and certain executives of the Company are considered related
parties to this offering. The offering closed on September 30, 2024. The Company received net proceeds of 
million after deductions for placement agent commissions and other offering costs of 
million and 
million, respectively. (See Note 4) 

In
addition, Beyond Air and Avenue Capital Management II, L.P., Avenue Venture Opportunities Fund, L.P. and Avenue Venture
Opportunities Fund II, L.P. collectively, Avenue Capital reached an agreement to extinguish the Avenue Capital
senior secured term loan for a one-time payment of 
million. This agreement eliminates the debt and interest payments that would have been made to Avenue Capital from October 1, 2024
through June 30, 2026 of 
million. In connection with this agreement 
million was paid on September 27, 2024 in partial settlement. The Company remeasured the fair value of the derivative liability to
 at September 30, 2024 as Avenue Capital did not exercise the conversion right related to the loan agreement prior to the
extinguishment of the loan agreement and the conversion price exceeded the fair market value of the underlying securities. The final
 
million was paid on October 4, 2024. Avenue Capital invested 
million in the securities purchase agreement II at the same terms and conditions as all other investors. (See Note 14) 

With
respect to Beyond Cancer, discussions are underway with investment banks to raise capital based on their most recent top line data from
the phase 1a, first-in-human trial which was successful in the first 6 patients with no dose limiting toxicities at the first dose. A
combination study with anti-PD1 therapy is expected to begin before the end of calendar 2024 if the company is successful in raising capital.

to . The lease term
is adjusted for renewal or termination options that the Company believe the customer is reasonably certain to exercise. 

The
Company elected the practical expedient applied to operating leases not to separate lease and non-lease components as long as the lease
and at non-lease components have the same timing and pattern of transfer. As such, the non-lease components, including the Consumables
and Services, are combined with the predominant lease component. The total fixed fees that the Company is reasonably certain to collect
are recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the arrangement. Additionally, the Company made an accounting policy election
to present LungFit PH revenue net of sales and other similar taxes. 

Amounts
billed in advance of performance obligations being satisfied are recognized as deferred revenue. 

At
the lease commencement date, the Company will defer initial direct costs, including commission expense and the cost is recognized over
the lease term on the same basis as lease income. 

The
Company records the costs of shipping related to contract devices and consumables in cost of revenue in its consolidated statements of
operations.

Note 12 to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for more information regarding leasing arrangements.

The
common stock warrants issued in connection with the Loan and Security Agreement in June 2023 (Note 11) are recorded as a warrant liability
within the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2024 as the warrants contain certain settlement features
that are not indexed to the Company s own stock. In addition, the conversion feature embedded within the long term debt required
bifurcation as certain adjustments to the conversion price were not indexed to the Company s own stock and recorded as a derivative
liability. The warrants and derivative liability are remeasured each reporting period with the change in fair value recorded to other
income (expense) in the condensed consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss until the warrants and derivative are exercised,
expired, reclassified or otherwise settled. The significant assumptions used in valuing the warrants and derivative were as follows:

The
bifurcated derivative liability was revalued to zero at September 30, 2024 as the conversion feature has a premium to the latest
price per round, and was known/knowable at September 30, 2024 to not be exercised by the Lenders by October 4, 2024 due to the conversion
price exceeding the fair market value of the underlying securities. Accordingly, there was fair value to the conversion feature derivative
as of September 30, 2024. 

On September 27, 2024, the company received

On

of per share and an additional end of term payment of plus legal and amendment fees, which resulted in an increase to debt
discount and this increase will be amortized over the remainder of the loan period. As the transaction did not have a substantially different
impact to the terms of the original instrument, the company determined that this transaction was a modification to the original loan
and security agreement. The maturity of the debt remains unchanged. 

The
warrants are freestanding liability classified financial instruments to which a portion of the debt proceeds were allocated to warrants
and based on the warrants estimated fair value at issuance. The remaining proceeds were allocated to the long-term debt. Costs allocated
to the warrants were expensed immediately and costs allocated to the debt are recorded as a debt discount and are amortized into interest

Introduction 

We
are a commercial-stage medical device and biopharmaceutical company developing a platform of nitric oxide NO generators
and delivery systems (the LungFit platform capable of generating NO from ambient air. Our first device,
LungFit PH received premarket approval PMA from the FDA in June 2022. The NO generated by the LungFit 
 PH system is indicated to improve oxygenation and reduce the need for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in term and near-term
(>34 weeks gestation) neonates with hypoxic respiratory failure associated with clinical or echocardiographic evidence of pulmonary
hypertension in conjunction with ventilatory support and other appropriate agents. This condition is commonly referred to as persistent
pulmonary hypertension of the newborn PPHN ). The LungFit platform can generate NO up to 400 parts per
million ppm for delivery to a patient s lungs directly or via a ventilator. LungFit can deliver
NO either continuously or for a fixed amount of time at various flow rates and has the ability to either titrate dose on demand or maintain
a constant dose. In July 2022, we commenced marketing LungFit PH in the United States for PPHN as a medical device. 

LungFit 
 can be used to treat patients on ventilators that require NO, as well as patients with chronic or acute severe lung infections
via delivery through a breathing mask or similar apparatus. Furthermore, we believe that there is a high unmet medical need for patients
suffering from certain severe lung infections that the LungFit platform can potentially address. Our current areas of
focus with LungFit are PPHN, viral community-acquired pneumonia VCAP including COVID-19, bronchiolitis BRO ), nontuberculous mycobacteria NTM lung infection and those with various severe lung infections with
underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease COPD ). Our current product candidates will be subject to premarket reviews
and approvals by the FDA, certification through the conduct of a conformity assessment by a notified body in the EU for the product to
be CE marked, as well as comparable foreign regulatory authorities. 

With
Beyond Air s focus on NO and its effect on the human condition, there are two additional programs that do not utilize our LungFit 
 system. Through our majority-owned affiliate Beyond Cancer, Ltd. Beyond Cancer ), NO is used to target solid tumors.
The LungFit platform is not utilized for the solid tumor indication due to the need for ultra-high concentrations of
gaseous nitric oxide UNO ). A proprietary delivery system has been developed that is designed to safely deliver UNO in
excess of 10,000 ppm directly to a solid tumor. This program has advanced to phase 1 clinical trials. 

On
November 4, 2021, we reorganized our oncology business into a new private company called Beyond Cancer. Our preclinical oncology team
and the exclusive right to the intellectual property portfolio utilizing UNO for the treatment of solid tumors now reside with Beyond
Cancer. Beyond Air has 80 ownership in Beyond Cancer. 

The
second program, which does not utilize the LungFit platform, partially inhibits neuronal nitric oxide synthase nNOS in the brain to treat neurological conditions. The first target indication is autism spectrum disorder ASD ). ASD is a
serious neurodevelopmental and behavioral disorder, and one of the most disabling conditions and chronic illnesses in children. ASD includes
a wide range of developmental disorders that share a core of neurobehavioral deficits manifested by abnormalities in social interactions,
deficits in communication, restricted interests, and repetitive behaviors. In 2023, the CDC reported that approximately 1 in 36 children
in the U.S. is diagnosed with an ASD. The cost of caring for Americans with autism had reached 268 billion in 2015 and would rise to
 461 billion by 2025 in the absence of more-effective interventions and support across the life span. We expect this program to progress
from preclinical to a phase 1 first-in-human clinical trial in 2025. Beyond Air has formed a wholly owned subsidiary called NeuroNOS
which is responsible for pre-clinical and clinical development. 

LungFit 
 PH is the first FDA-approved system using our patented plasma pulse technology to generate on-demand NO from ambient air and, regardless
of dose or flow, deliver it to a ventilator circuit. The device uses a medical air compressor to drive room air through a plasma chamber
in the center of the unit where pulses of electrical discharge are created between two electrodes. The system uses the power equivalent
to a 60-watt lightbulb to ionize the nitrogen and oxygen molecules, which then combine as NO with low levels of nitrogen dioxide NO 2 created as a byproduct. The products are then passed through a Smart Filter, which removes the toxic NO 2 from the internal
circuit. With respect to PPHN, the novel LungFit PH is designed to deliver a dosage of NO to the lungs that is consistent
with current guidelines for delivery of 20 ppm NO with a range of 0.5 ppm 80 ppm (low concentration NO) for ventilated patients. 

We
believe the ability of LungFit PH to generate NO from ambient air provides us with many competitive advantages over the
current standard of NO delivery systems in the U.S., the EU, Japan and other markets. For example, LungFit PH does not
require the use of a high-pressure cylinder, does not require cumbersome purging procedures and places less burden on hospital staff
in carrying out safety procedures. 

Our
novel LungFit platform can also deliver a high concentration > 150 ppm) of NO directly to the lungs, which
we believe has the potential to eliminate microbial infections including bacteria, fungi and viruses, among others. We believe that current
FDA-approved NO vasodilation treatments would have limited success in treating microbial infections given the low concentrations of NO
being delivered 80 ppm NO. 

LungFit 
 PH for the treatment of Persistent Pulmonary Hypertension of the Newborn (PPHN) 

In
June 2022, the FDA approved LungFit PH to improve oxygenation and reduce the need for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation
in term and near-term (>34 weeks gestation) neonates with hypoxic respiratory failure associated with clinical or echocardiographic
evidence of pulmonary hypertension in conjunction with ventilatory support and other appropriate agents. LungFit PH is
the inaugural device from the LungFit platform of NO generators that use patented ionizer technology and is the first
FDA-approved product for Beyond Air. 

29 

We
submitted a PMA supplement to the FDA in November 2023 for the expansion of the label to include certain cardiac surgeries and we expect
to receive CE mark under the Medical Device Regulation MDR in the EU during the second half of calendar 2024. According
to the most recent year-end report from Mallinckrodt Pharmaceuticals Mallinckrodt ), sales of NO were 303.2 million in
2023 (down from 339.7 million in 2022) for the United States, Canada, Japan, Mexico and Australia, with >90 in the United States.
Outside of the U.S. there are multiple market participants which translates to considerably lower sales than in the U.S. We believe the
addressable U.S. market for LungFit PH to be approximately 350 million and worldwide to be approximately 700 million.
We initiated the first phase of our commercial launch (the limited launch phase to introduce Lungfit PH and Beyond Air to hospitals)
in July 2022, and entered into phase 2 (to target initial market share gains in certain geographies) with an expanded commercial presence
during the spring of 2023 in the U.S. and will continue to work towards a potential launch in the EU and globally in 2024 and beyond.
We anticipate entering the final phase of our launch process in calendar 2025 where we intend to equip our commercial organization to
become the market leader in the U.S. in a few years. 

LungFit 
 PRO for the treatment of viral lung infections in hospitalized patients 

Viral
Community-Acquired Pneumonia (including COVID-19) 

Viral
pneumonia in adults is most commonly caused by rhinovirus, respiratory syncytial virus RSV and influenza virus. However,
newly emerging viruses (including SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2, avian influenza A, and H1N1 viruses) have been identified as pathogens contributing
to the overall burden of adult viral pneumonia. COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, that resulted in a global pandemic,
causing millions of hospitalizations and over 7 million deaths worldwide reported as of January 2024, according to the World Health Organization.
Excluding the pandemic, there are approximately 350,000 annual viral pneumonia hospitalizations in the U.S., and up to 16 million annual
viral pneumonia hospitalizations globally. For the broader annual viral pneumonia hospitalizations, we believe U.S. market potential
to be greater than 1.5 billion and worldwide market potential to be greater than 3 billion. 

We
initiated a pilot clinical trial in late 2020 using our novel LungFit PRO system at 150 ppm to treat patients with VCAP. The trial
was a multi-center, open-label, randomized clinical trial in Israel, including patients infected with COVID-19. Patients were randomized
in a 1:1 ratio to receive either inhalations of 150 ppm NO given intermittently for 40 minutes four times per day for up to seven days
in addition to standard supportive treatment NO+SST or standard supportive treatment alone SST ). Endpoints
related to safety (primary endpoint), oxygen saturation and ICU admission, among others, were assessed. 

We
presented results from the pilot clinical trial at the 32 nd European Congress of Clinical Microbiology Infectious Diseases
(ECCMID 2022), which took place from April 23, 2022 through April 26, 2022 as a hybrid event both onsite in Lisbon, Portugal and online.
At the time of the data cut off, the trial enrolled a total of 40 patients hospitalized for VCAP (SARS-CoV-2, n=39; other viruses n=1).
The intent-to-treat population included 35 patients with 16 patients in the inhaled NO group and 19 patients in the control group. The
primary COVID-19 treatments used during the clinical trial were Remdesivir (>30 and Dexamethasone (>65 ). Safety data from the
clinical trial show that inhaled NO treatment was well tolerated overall with no treatment related adverse events as assessed by the
investigators. There were two serious adverse events SAEs reported in the group receiving inhaled NO along with SST,
which were determined to be related to underlying conditions and unrelated to clinical trial drug/device. From an efficacy perspective,
results show a trend of shortening length of stay LOS by a factor 1.8 in favor of inhaled NO treatment. Duration of oxygen
support, measured in-hospital and at home, was significantly shorter (p=0.0339) for inhaled NO treated patients. Patients with unstable
oxygen saturation during hospitalization, 66.7 of the inhaled NO treatment group, reached stable saturation of 93 during hospital
stay as compared to 26.7 in the SST group. 

Following
completion of the clinical trial and the 180-day follow-up period, incremental data were provided in a poster presentation at IDWeek
2022 held from October 19, 2022, through October 23, 2022 in Washington, D.C. In addition to the positive clinical results provided at
ECCMID 2022, the poster showed a larger decline in c-reactive protein CRP from baseline for patients treated with NO
+ SST compared to the control group. Analysis of the data provides compelling evidence that high concentration NO delivery with the LungFit 
PRO generator and delivery system can be a powerful tool against any type of pneumonia, especially COVID-19. The Company commenced a
clinical trial in the second half of calendar 2023 in the United States and has made the decision to pause this study pending future
funding. 

Bronchiolitis
(BRO) 

Bronchiolitis
is the leading cause of hospital admission in children less than 1 year of age. The incidence is estimated to be 150 million new cases
a year worldwide, with 2-3 (over 3 million) of them severe enough to require hospitalization. Worldwide, 95 of all cases occur in developing
countries. In the U.S., there are approximately 120,000 annual bronchiolitis hospitalizations and approximately 3.2 million annual child
hospitalizations globally. Currently, there is no approved treatment for bronchiolitis. The treatment for acute viral lung infections
that cause bronchiolitis in infants is largely supportive care and is based primarily on prolonged hospitalization during which the infant
receives a constant flow of oxygen to treat hypoxemia, a reduced concentration of oxygen in the blood. In addition, systemic steroids
and inhalation with bronchodilators are sometimes utilized until recovery, but we believe that these treatments do not successfully reduce
hospital LOS. We believe the U.S. market potential for bronchiolitis to be greater than 500 million and worldwide market potential to
be greater than 1.2 billion. 

The
pivotal clinical trial for bronchiolitis was originally set to be performed in the winter of 2020/21 but was delayed due to the pandemic.
We have completed three successful pilot studies for bronchiolitis. A further analysis of the three previously reported pilot studies
was presented at the ATS International Conference 2021, which was held virtually from May 14, 2021 through May 19, 2021. Analysis across
the studies (n=198 infants, mean age 3.9 months) showed that 150 ppm 160 ppm NO administered intermittently was generally safe
and well tolerated with adverse event rates similar among treatment groups with no reported treatment-related serious adverse events.
The short course of treatments with intermittent high concentration inhaled NO was effective in shortening hospital LOS and accelerating
time to fit for discharge a composite endpoint of clinical signs and symptoms to indicate readiness to be evaluated for hospital
discharge. This treatment was also effective in accelerating time to stable oxygen saturation measured as SpO2 92 in room
air. Additionally, NO at a dose of 85 ppm NO showed no difference compared to control for all efficacy endpoints, while 150 ppm NO showed
statistical significance when compared to control. 

30 

Additionally,
long-term safety data for high concentration inhaled NO in bronchiolitis was presented at the Pediatric Academic Societies Meeting 2022
(PAS 22), which was held in Denver, Colorado from April 21, 2022 through April 25, 2022. A total of 101 infants from the three prior
pilot studies for bronchiolitis (n=198) participated in the long-term follow-up clinical trial. Clinical trial endpoints for the long-term
safety clinical trial included percentage of patients re-hospitalized for bronchiolitis related reasons, such reasons included wheezing
episodes, pneumonia, and asthma and the percentage of patients re-hospitalized for any reason. Data from the clinical trial showed the
re-hospitalization rate per 100 Patient Exposure Years (PEY) due to bronchiolitis related reasons trended favorably for the inhaled NO
group. In addition, the long-term patient re-hospitalization rate for any reason was similar between inhaled NO and control groups. As
such, the clinical trial concluded that the treatment of hospitalized infants with acute bronchiolitis by intermittent high dose inhaled
NO shows a favorable long-term safety profile. 

We
believe that the entirety of data at 150 ppm 160 ppm NO in both adult and infant patient populations supports further development
of LungFit PRO in a pivotal clinical trial for patients hospitalized with VCAP or bronchiolitis. 

LungFit 
 GO for the treatment of Nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) 

NTM
lung infection is a rare and serious pulmonary disease associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Patients with NTM lung disease
may experience a multitude of symptoms such as fever, weight loss, cough, lack of appetite, night sweats, blood in the sputum and fatigue.
Patients with NTM lung disease, specifically Mycobacterium abscessus M. abscessus representing 20 to 25 of all NTM
and other forms of NTM that are refractory to antibiotic therapy , frequently require lengthy and repeated hospital stays to manage
their condition. There are no treatments specifically indicated for the treatment of M. Abscessus lung disease in North America,
Europe or Japan. 

Current
estimates place the number of people with NTM infections in the U.S as high as 220,000. It is estimated that in Asia, the number of patients
suffering from NTM surpasses what is seen in the U.S. There is one inhaled antibiotic approved for the treatment of refractory Mycobacterium
avium complex MAC ). Current guideline-based approaches to treat NTM lung disease involve multi-drug regimens of antibiotics
that may cause severe, long lasting side effects, and treatment can be longer than 18 months. Median survival for NTM MAC patients is
approximately 13 years while median survival for patients with other variations of NTM is typically 4.6 years. The prevalence of human
disease attributable to NTM has increased over the past two decades. In a clinical trial conducted between 2007 and 2016, researchers
found that the prevalence of NTM in the U.S. is increasing at approximately 7.5 per year. M. abscessus treatment costs are estimated
to be more than double that of MAC. A 2015 publication by co-authors from several U.S. government departments stated that cases in 2014
alone cost the U.S. healthcare system approximately 1.7 billion. For this indication, we believe U.S. sales potential to be greater
than 1 billion and worldwide sales potential to be greater than 2.5 billion. 

In
December 2020 we began a 12-week, multi-center, open-label clinical trial in Australia intended to enroll approximately 20 adult patients
with chronic refractory NTM lung disease. We received a grant of up to 2.17 million from the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation CFF to fund this clinical trial and advance the clinical development of inhaled NO to treat NTM pulmonary disease. The trial enrolled both
cystic fibrosis CF and non-CF patients infected with MAC, M. abscessus or any strain of NTM. The clinical trial
consisted of a run-in period followed by two treatment phases. The run-in period provided a baseline for the efficacy endpoints. The
first treatment phase took place over a two-week period and began in the hospital setting where patients were titrated from 150 ppm NO
up to 250 ppm NO over several days. During this phase patients received NO for 40 minutes, four times per day while Methemoglobin MetHb levels were monitored. Patients were also trained to use LungFit GO and subsequently discharged to complete the remaining
portion of the two-week treatment period at their home at the highest tolerated NO concentration. For the second treatment phase, a 10-week
maintenance phase, the administration was twice daily. The clinical trial evaluated safety, quality of life, physical function, and bacterial
load among other parameters. 

At
the American Thoracic Society International Conference 2022 (ATS 2022), which was held in San Francisco from May 13, 2022 through May
18, 2022, we presented positive interim data from the ongoing clinical trial. At the time of data cutoff on April 4, 2022, a total of
15 patients were enrolled in the pilot clinical trial. The mean age of patients was 62.1 years (range: 22 82 years) with the
majority female (80 ), a distribution consistent with real-world NTM disease. All 15 patients were successfully titrated to 250 ppm NO
in the hospital setting, and no patients required dose reductions during the subsequent at-home portion of the clinical trial. Patients
were followed up for 12 weeks after the 12-week treatment period was completed. 

After
completion of the clinical trial, we presented positive results at the American College of Chest Physicians CHEST annual
meeting, held from October 16, 2022 through October 19, 2022, further supporting development of intermittent high dose NO for the treatment
of NTM. The clinical trial demonstrated that high dose NO treatment was well-tolerated in both the home and hospital settings. During
the 10-week at-home treatment period of the clinical trial, a total of 2,492 inhalations were self-administered with overall high treatment
compliance (>90 ). There were no SAEs related to treatment discontinuations reported over the 12-week treatment or 12-week follow
up periods. Key efficacy endpoints showed strong results with improvement seen in the majority of quality-of-life domains. Respiratory
function and physical function were maintained during treatment and follow-up. Trends in the reduction of microbial load were observed
and one patient achieved culture conversion with three consecutive negative sputum samples. We anticipate commencing a pivotal clinical
trial in calendar year 2026 following discussions with the FDA. 

Our
program in COPD is in the preclinical stage and will move forward subject to obtaining additional financing.

Ultra-High
Concentration NO (UNO) in solid tumors through majority-owned affiliate Beyond Cancer, Ltd. 

In
the fourth calendar quarter of 2021, Beyond Cancer, our majority-owned affiliate, raised 30 million in a private placement of common
shares. The investors purchased a 20 equity ownership in Beyond Cancer, while Beyond Air maintained 80 equity ownership. The funding
is being used to accelerate ongoing preclinical work, including the completion of IND-enabling studies, completion of a Phase 1 clinical
trial, expansion of preclinical programs for combination studies, hiring of additional Beyond Cancer team members, and optimization of
the delivery system, as well as for general corporate purposes. 

Beyond
Cancer will benefit from Beyond Air s NO expertise, IP portfolio, preclinical oncology team, and regulatory progress, and will
pay Beyond Air a single-digit royalty on all future revenues. Beyond Cancer is being led by a seasoned leadership team with experience
in emerging healthcare companies and clinical oncology. 

UNO
has shown anticancer properties in preclinical trials by eliciting an immune response from the host. We have released preclinical data
at several medical/scientific conferences showing the promise of delivering NO directly to tumors at concentrations of 20,000 ppm 
200,000 ppm. Results showed that local tumor ablation with NO conveyed anti-tumor immunity to the host. In April 2022, we presented in
vivo and in vitro preclinical data at the American Association for Cancer Research AACR 2022 annual meeting.
The in vivo study assessed the mode of action following a single 5-minute gaseous NO gNO treatment which provided
data showing an effect on the primary tumor 14 days post-treatment. These data showed that intratumoral injections of concentrations
of gNO at 20,000 and 50,000 ppm led to increased recruitment of T cells, B cells, macrophages, and dendrocytes to the primary tumor.
An elevated number of T cells and B cells were also detected in the spleen and blood 21 days following gNO treatment. In addition, at
the same time point, a marked reduction in the number of myeloid-derived suppressor cells was observed in the spleen. Results from the
 in vitro study showed that exposure of six different cancer cell lines including human ovarian and pancreatic and mouse
lung, melanoma, colon, and breast to UNO ranging from 10,000 ppm to 100,000 ppm for up to 10 minutes resulted in a dose-dependent
cytotoxic response. The higher concentration doses of gNO led to near-instant cell death, while the lower concentration doses required
a longer exposure period to elicit cell death. Cell viability was assessed using two assays: XTT and clonogenic assay. After one minute
of exposure to 25,000 ppm gNO, less than 10 viability was observed in all cell lines. 

The
second half of calendar year 2022 was a time of significant progress for Beyond Cancer. On August 23, 2022, we announced that the first
patient was treated in a first-in-human Phase 1 clinical trial to assess the safety and immune biomarkers of UNO therapy. In November,
at the annual meeting of the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer SITC ), we presented new in vivo combination data that
support the potential of our novel UNO therapy to treat various types of solid tumors in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitor ICI therapies, including anti-PD-1. The data presented at SITC appears to indicate that UNO in combination with anti-PD-1
treatment may lead to higher tumor regression rates and prolonged survival. Also in 2022, on December 13, we announced the publication
of preclinical data in the peer-reviewed journal Cancer Cell International (CCI), which showed that our proprietary tumor ablation technology
utilizing UNO induced a potent innate and adaptive immune response that prevented metastases and resulted in a statistically significant
survival benefit. 

Calendar
year 2023 began with the announcement of Beyond Cancer s entry into a sponsored research agreement with Stanford School of Medicine
and the appointment of Frederick M. Dirbas, MD, Associate Professor of Surgery, Division of Surgical Oncology, Stanford School of Medicine,
and Mark D. Pegram, MD, the Suzy Yuan-Huey Hung Endowed Professor of Medical Oncology at the Stanford School of Medicine, to the Beyond
Cancer Scientific Advisory Board SAB ). In addition to the research agreement, Dr. Dirbas was named as Chair of the SAB,
which provides guidance for ongoing preclinical studies as well as ongoing and planned future clinical trials in the use of UNO to treat
solid tumors. The newly appointed members of the SAB will work to provide input on the clinical development of Beyond Cancer s
UNO technology, particularly as it relates to the U.S. regulatory submission. 

In
April 2023, Beyond Cancer presented additional preclinical data for UNO therapy in solid tumors during the AACR 2023 annual meeting.
Data showed a statistically significant survival benefit for repeat dosing of UNO compared to anti-mCTLA-4 as monotherapy and repeat
doses of UNO prolonged survival in combination with anti-PD-1 compared to gNO alone. With regard to tumor volume, statistically significant
reductions were observed with repeat dosing of UNO versus anti-mPD-1 as a monotherapy and in combination with anti-CTLA-4 versus anti-CTLA-4
alone. Additionally, the data shows that short exposures between 10 seconds to one minute of tumor cells to UNO at increasing concentrations
of 25,000 ppm to 100,000 ppm NO significantly upregulate mPD-L1 expression in a dose and time-dependent manner. Also, in vivo experiments
exhibited a statistically significant day 1 increase in M1 macrophages, decrease in Tregs, and reduction in tumor cell viability was
directionally maintained through day 5. We believe that together with the known ability of NO to activate and recruit the immune system,
the data presented at this year s AACR annual meeting appears to indicate that repeat dosing of UNO is feasible and may be effective
even in difficult-to-treat, non-immunogenic tumor types. 

In
October 2023, Beyond Cancer presented positive pre-clinical data at the EORTC International Conference on Molecular Targets and Cancer
Therapeutics, demonstrating a statistically significant survival benefit in mice treated with UNO plus anti-PD1 versus anti-PD1 alone.
This was a pooled analysis of multiple studies done with 50,000 or 100,000 ppm NO for a single administration of 5 or 10 minutes. Additionally,
Beyond Cancer s second manuscript was published in the Cells Journal in an article titled Intratumoral Administration
of High-Concentration Nitric Oxide and Anti-mPD-1 Treatment Improves Tumor Regression Rates and Survival in CT26 Tumor-Bearing Mice. 

32 

In
late December 2023, the Company s safety review committee completed its review of the first 6 human subjects treated with UNO and
reported that there were no dose limiting toxicities at the 25,000 ppm NO concentration and the study may progress to the next concentration
of 50,000 ppm NO. 

In
June 2024 at the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO), the Company presented single agent treatment in relapsed or refractory
unresectable, primary or metastatic cutaneous and subcutaneous malignancies at UNO doses of 25,000 and 50,000 parts per million. The
immune biomarker data at Day 21, following a single 5 minute dose of UNO 50,000 ppm, demonstrated increases in dendritic cells, cytotoxic
T-cells, central memory T-cells and a favorable increase in the M1/M2 ratio. Myeloid Derived Suppressor Cells (MDSCs) also showed a 54 
decrease. In the 25,000 ppm cohort, the same stimulatory immune biomarkers were upregulated. UNO was generally well tolerated with primarily
Grade 1 related toxicities. One Grade 3 adverse event was deemed a dose limiting toxicity in the 50,000 ppm cohort resulting in the expansion
of the cohort to six total subjects. 

The
Company also reported a case of relapsed/refractory Triple Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC) in which the subject showed no evidence of malignancy
in a satellite lesion 21 days following UNO treatment and a corollary, rapid and durable clinical resolution of radiation-induced dermatitis. 

A
Phase 1b trial protocol has been submitted to the Israeli Ministry of Health (IMOH) and upon regulatory approval, this trial will enroll
up to 20 subjects with prior exposure to anti-PD-1 antibody that have either progressed, not achieved a response, or have prolonged stable
disease 12 weeks) on single agent anti-PD-1 without radiographic evidence of continued tumor reduction. Subjects enrolled in the Phase
1b trial will be treated with the UNO + anti-PD-1 combination. 

Selective
neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) inhibitor for the treatment of neurological conditions in collaboration with Hebrew University
of Jerusalem 

On
June 15, 2023, we announced that we had entered into an agreement with Yissum Research Development Company of the Hebrew University of
Jerusalem, LTD. (the University to acquire the commercial rights for neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) inhibitors
being developed for the treatment of autism spectrum disorder ASD and other neurological conditions. Currently, there
are no FDA-approved therapies utilizing nNOS inhibitors specifically for the treatment of ASD. Under the terms of the agreement, Beyond
Air will make payments to the University over the two-year period from the date of the agreement for preclinical work. Also, we will
pay a low single-digit royalty on net sales and certain one-time payments based on clinical, regulatory and sales milestones. 

Work
is currently being done by the University in a preclinical setting. We expect the program to progress into a phase 1 first-in-human clinical
trial prior to the end of calendar year 2025.

Research
and development expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were 4.6 million as compared to 7.1 million for the three months
ended September 30, 2023. The decrease of 2.5 million was primarily attributed to a decrease in spend in salaries 0.6 million 0.7
million in Beyond Air offset by an increase of 0.1 million in Beyond Cancer), stock-based compensation 0.5 million in Beyond Air and
 0.5 million in Beyond Cancer), pre-clinical studies 1.0 million related to Beyond Cancer offset by an increase in spend of 0.2 million
in NeuroNos), professional fees 0.4 million in Beyond Cancer offset by an increase spend in Beyond Air 0.1 million), travel expenses
 0.1 million in Beyond Air, offset by an increased spend related to clinical studies 0.2 million. 

Research
and development expenses for the six months ended September 30, 2024 were 10.6 million as compared to 11.8 million for the six months
ended September 30, 2023. The decrease of 1.2 million was attributed primarily to a decreased in stock compensation 1.6 million (of

Beyond Air of 0.3 million) and clinical spend 0.9 million in Beyond Air offset by a decreased spend in Beyond Cancer 0.1 million). 

Selling,
General and Administrative Expenses 

Selling,
general and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 were 7.2 million and 10.2
million, respectively. The decrease of 3.0 million was attributed primarily to a decrease of 2.4 million due to stock based compensation
cost (of which 1.2 million related to Beyond Air and 1.2 million related to Beyond Cancer), 0.2 million marketing and advertising
costs for Beyond Air, 0.2 million of legal fees and 0.2 million of travel expenses. 

Selling,
general and administrative expenses for the six months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 were 14.4 million and 21.1 million,

expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and September 30, 2023 was an expense of 1.2 million and income of 0.1
million, respectively. The increase in expense of 1.3 million was attributed primarily to decreased dividend and interest income of
 0.5 million, 0.6 million related to the loss on partial extinguishment of the Loan and Security agreement Agreement (the
 Loan and Security Agreement with Avenue Capital Management II, L.P., as administrative agent and collateral agent
(the Agent ), Avenue Venture Opportunities Fund, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership Avenue ), and

Investing
Activities 

For
the six months ended September 30, 2024, net cash provided by investing activities was 19.3 million. For the six months ended
September 30, 2023, net cash used in investing activities was 11.4 million. In the six months ended September 30, 2024, the Company
redeemed a net 23 million of excess cash in high quality, short term, U.S. dollar denominated marketable equities with high
liquidity and invested 3.9 million for the purchase of property and equipment, mainly LungFit PH devices. In the six months ended
September 30, 2023, the Company invested 8.9 million of excess cash in high quality, short term, U.S. dollar denominated
marketable equities with high liquidity, and 2.5 million for the purchase of property and equipment, mainly LungFit PH
devices. 

Financing
Activities 

Net
cash provided by financing activities for the six months ended September 30, 2024 was 21.4 million, mainly from the issuance of
securities through securities purchase agreements which the net proceeds were 19 million, 7.5 million advance payment on loan and
security agreement, and the issuance of common stock in
connection with the At-The-Market Offering Sales Agreement with Truist Securities, Inc (the 2022 ATM of 0.6 million
partially offset by 5.7 million from the payment of short-term loans, including a 5.0 million partial repayment to Avenue Capital.
Net cash provided by financing activities for the six months ended September 30, 2023 was 22.0 million, mainly from the Loan and
Security Agreement of which the net proceeds were 15.8 million, and the issuance of common stock in connection with the 2022 ATM of
 6.7 million partially offset by 0.5 million from the payment of short-term loans. 

Future
Funding Requirements 

We
have generated revenue of 2.6 million from the sale of products to date. We had an operating cash flow decrease of 23.5 million for
the six months ended September 30, 2024 and we have experienced an accumulated loss of 265.2 million since inception through September
30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of 28.4 million 22.6 million excluding
Beyond Cancer) and 0.2 million in restricted cash. Management believes these factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s
ability to meet its obligations with cash on hand, however, management believes this doubt is alleviated through plans for increased
revenues and decreased expenditures, many of which have already been implemented, enabling increased cash flows. The company has recently
signed agreements with TrillaMed (providing access to Department of Defense and Veterans Affairs hospitals), Healthcare Links (expanding
access to group purchasing organizations and integrated delivery networks) and Business Asia Consultants (accelerating global expansion)
which will drive increased revenues. The company has implemented a capital conservation strategy, reducing our back office footprint,
reducing staffing levels by over 30 across the company, placing our VCAP study on hold pending future funding and adjusting our production
forecasts. The Company expects an immediate benefit from these actions. 

Management is confident that the efforts it has implemented
to increase revenues and decrease expenditures, while not assured, will enable the Company to meet its obligations. 

36 

Our
future capital needs and the adequacy of our available funds will depend on many factors, including, but not necessarily limited to,
the cost and time necessary for the development, preclinical studies, clinical trials and certification or regulatory approval of our
other medical devices, indications as well as the commercial success of our approved product and any product candidates that receive
marketing approval by the FDA. We may be required to raise additional funds through sale of equity or debt securities or through strategic
collaborations and/or licensing agreements in order to fund operations until we are able to generate enough product or royalty revenues,
if any. Financing may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all, and our failure to raise capital when needed could have a material
adverse effect on our strategic objectives, results of operations and financial condition. 

On
May 25, 2021, the Company and Circassia Limited and its affiliates (collectively Circassia entered into a settlement agreement the Settlement Agreement resolving all claims by and between the parties and mutually terminating the agreement with
Circassia disclosed in Note 8 above. Pursuant to the terms of the Settlement Agreement, the Company agreed to pay Circassia 10.5 million
in three installments. The first payment of 2.5 million was triggered upon FDA approval for the LungFit PH (fixing the
Initial Payment Due Date at July 28, 2022). Thereafter, the Company paid 3.5 million to Circassia on the first anniversary of the
Initial Payment Due Date and 4.5 million on the second anniversary of the Initial Payment Due Date, which was in the second fiscal quarter of 2025. Additionally, beginning in the third fiscal quarter of 2025, Circassia will receive a quarterly royalty payment equal to 5 of LungFit PH net sales in the U.S.
until the final 6.0 million has been paid. 

On
February 4, 2022, we entered into an At-The-Market Equity Offering Sales Agreement with Truist Securities, Inc. and Oppenheimer 
Co, Inc. (the 2022 ATM ). Under the 2022 ATM, we may sell shares of our common stock having aggregate sales proceeds of
up to 50.0 million, from time to time and at various prices. Pursuant to the baby shelf rules promulgated by the
SEC, if our public float is less than 75.0 million as of specified measurement periods, the number of shares of common stock that may
be offered and sold by us under a Form S-3 registration statement, including pursuant to the 2022 ATM, in any twelve-month period is
limited to an aggregate amount that does not exceed one-third of our public float. As of September 30, 2024, due to the SEC s baby
shelf rules, we were permitted to sell up to 10.5 million of shares of common stock
pursuant to the 2022 ATM. We will remain subject to the baby shelf rules under the Form S-3 registration statement until
such time as our public float exceeds 75.0 million. If shares of our common stock are sold, there is a 3 fee paid to the sales agent. 

On
June 15, 2023 (the Closing Date ), the Company and its wholly owned subsidiary, Beyond Air Ltd. entered into a Loan and
Security Agreement (the LSA with Avenue Capital Management II, L.P., as administrative agent and collateral agent
(the Agent ), Avenue Venture Opportunities Fund, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership Avenue ), and
Avenue Venture Opportunities Fund II, L.P, a Delaware limited partnership Avenue 2 and, together with Avenue, the
 Lenders ). Also on June 15, 2023, the Company entered into a Supplement to the LSA (collectively with the Agreement,
the Loan Agreement with the Agent and the Lenders for senior secured term loans, with 17.5 million advanced on the
Closing Date. On September 30, 2024 Beyond Air and Avenue Capital Management II, L.P., Avenue Venture Opportunities Fund, L.P. and
Avenue Venture Opportunities Fund II, L.P. collectively, Avenue Capital reached an agreement to extinguish the
Avenue Capital senior secured term loan for a one-time payment of 17.85 million. This agreement eliminates the debt and interest
payments that would have been made to Avenue Capital from October 1, 2024 through June 30, 2026 of 12.0 million. In connection with
this agreement 5.0 million was paid on September 27, 2024 in partial settlement. The final 12.85million was paid on October 4,
2024. Avenue Capital invested 3.35 million in the securities purchase agreement II at the same terms and conditions as all other
investors. 

On September 27, 2024, we entered into a binding term
sheet for a secured loan with certain lenders including our Chief Executive Officer Steven Lisi and director Robert Carey. The Term Sheet
was approved by each of our independent and disinterested directors, following the receipt of a recommendation from an independent investment
bank. The Term Sheet provides for the following expected terms: (i) principal amount of 11,500,000; (ii) ten-year term; (iii) interest
of 15 per annum of which 12 shall be payable in kind through July 2026; (iv) a royalty interest of 8 of our net sales on a quarterly
basis from July 2026 until the facility is repaid in full; and (v) we shall issue the lenders warrants to purchase shares of common stock
at an exercise price of 0.3793 per share, in an aggregate amount equal to the quotient of the principal divided by the exercise price.
The Company finalized this loan and security agreement on November 1, 2024. (See Note 14) 

Our
ability to continue to operate beyond the third fiscal quarter of 2026 will be largely dependent upon the successful commercial launch
of LungFit PH, as well as obtaining partners in other parts of the world, and raising additional funds to finance our
activities until we are generating cash flow from operations. Further, there are no assurances that we will be successful in obtaining
an adequate level of financing for the development and commercialization of our other product candidates. 

There
are numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the development of our NO delivery system and we are unable to estimate the amounts
of increased capital outlays and operating expenses associated with the completion of the research and development of our product candidates. 

37 

Our
future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including: 

the
 progress and costs of our preclinical studies, clinical trials and other research and development activities; 

the
 costs of commercializing the LungFit system; 

the
 scope, prioritization and number of our clinical trials and other research and development programs; 

the
 costs and timing of obtaining certification or regulatory approval for our product candidates; 

the
 costs of filing, prosecuting, enforcing and defending patent claims and other intellectual property rights; 

the
 costs of, and timing for, strengthening our manufacturing agreements for production of sufficient clinical quantities of our product
 candidates; 

the
 potential costs of contracting with third parties to provide marketing and distribution services for us or for building such capacities
 internally; 

the
 costs of acquiring or undertaking the development and commercialization efforts for additional, future therapeutic applications of
 our product candidates; 

the
 magnitude of our general and administrative expenses; and 

any
 cost that we may incur under current and future in-and-out-licensing arrangements relating to our product candidates. 

ITEM
3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 

We
are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business. Market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial
position due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates. Our market risk exposure is primarily a result of foreign currency
exchange rates. 

ITEM
4. Controls and Procedures 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

We
carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer
(our principal executive officer) and Chief Financial Officer (our principal financial officer), of the effectiveness of the design and
operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act. Disclosure controls
and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an
issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the issuer s management,
including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate, to allow
timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and
operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating
the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based upon our evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of September 30, 2024. 

Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

During
the three months ended September 30, 2024, there were no changes made to our internal control over financial reporting that materially
affected, or that are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.

1A. Risk Factors 

There
have been no material changes to the risk factors previously disclosed in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors of our 2024 Annual
Report except as set forth below. 

If
we are unable to maintain listing of our securities on the Nasdaq Capital Market, our stock price could be adversely affected and the
liquidity of our stock and our ability to obtain financing could be impaired and it may be more difficult for our shareholders to sell
their securities. 

Although
our common stock is currently listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market, we may not be able to continue to meet the exchange s minimum
listing requirements or those of any other national exchange. If we are unable to maintain our listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market,
our common stock may be thinly traded. 

On
August 8, 2024, the Company received a letter from the staff of the Nasdaq Listing Qualifications Department (the Staff notifying the Company that, for the last 30 consecutive business days, the closing bid price for the Company s common stock has
been below the minimum 1.00 per share required for continued listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2)
(the Minimum Bid Price Requirement ). In accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), the Company has been given 180
calendar days, or until February 4, 2025, to regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement. If the Company does not regain
compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement by February 4, 2025, the Company may be afforded a second 180 calendar day period to
regain compliance. To qualify, the Company will be required to meet the continued listing requirement for market value of publicly held
shares and all other initial listing standards for the Nasdaq Capital Market with the exception of the Minimum Bid Price Requirement
and will need to provide written notice of its intention to cure the deficiency during such additional compliance period, by effecting
a reverse split of its common stock, if necessary. If it appears to the Staff that the Company will not be able to cure the deficiency,
or if the Company is otherwise not eligible for the additional compliance period, and the Company does not regain compliance by February
4, 2025, Nasdaq will provide written notification to the Company that its common stock is subject to delisting. At that time, the Company
may appeal the delisting determination to a hearings panel pursuant to the procedures set forth in the applicable Nasdaq Listing Rules. 

If
Nasdaq determines to delist our securities from trading on its exchange and we are unable to obtain listing on another national securities
exchange, a reduction in some or all of the following may occur, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our shareholders: 

the
 liquidity of our common stock; 

the
 market price of our common stock; 

our
 ability to obtain financing for the continuation of our operations; 

the
 number of investors that will consider investing in our common stock; 

the
 number of market makers in our common stock; 

the
 availability of information concerning the trading prices and volume of our common stock; and
