 CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 This report contains forward-looking statements that involve substantial risks and uncertainties. Such statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors and undue reliance should not be placed thereon. These forward-looking statements are not historical facts, but rather are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about HPS Corporate Capital Solutions Fund (the Company , we or our ), our current and prospective portfolio investments, our industry, our beliefs and opinions, and our assumptions. Words such as anticipates, expects, intends, plans, will, may, continue, believes, seeks, estimates, would, could, should, targets, projects, outlook, potential, predicts and variations of these words and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors, some of which are beyond our control and difficult to predict and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or forecasted in the forward-looking statements, including without limitation: 
 our future operating results; 
 our business prospects and the prospects of the companies in which we may invest, including our and their ability to achieve our respective objectives as a result of inflation, increases in borrowing costs and a potential global recession; 
 the impact of geo-political conditions, including revolution, insurgency, terrorism or war, including those arising out of the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine and the broader Middle East conflict; 
 the impact of the investments that we expect to make; 
 our ability to raise sufficient capital to execute our investment strategy; 
 our expected financing arrangements and investments; 
 the adequacy of our cash resources, financing sources and working capital; 
 changes in the general interest rate environment, including a sustained elevated interest rate environment, and uncertainty about the Federal Reserve s intentions regarding interest rates in the upcoming year; 
 the timing and amount of cash flows, distributions and dividends, if any, from our portfolio companies; 
 our contractual arrangements and relationships with third parties; 
 actual and potential conflicts of interest with HPS Advisors, LLC (the Adviser or any of its affiliates; 
 the elevated levels of inflation, and its impact on our portfolio companies and on the industries in which we may invest; 
 the dependence of our future success on the general economy and its effect on the industries in which we may invest; 
 the availability of credit and/or our ability to access the capital markets; 
 our use of financial leverage; 
 the ability of the Adviser to source suitable investments for us and to monitor and administer our investments; 
 the ability of the Adviser or its affiliates to attract and retain highly talented professionals; 
 our ability to qualify for and maintain our qualification as a regulated investment company and as a business development company BDC 
 the impact on our business of new or amended legislation or regulations; 
 currency fluctuations, particularly to the extent that we receive payments denominated in currency other than U.S. dollars; 
 the effect of changes to tax legislation and our tax position; and 
 the tax status of the enterprises in which we may invest. 
 Although we believe that the assumptions on which these forward-looking statements are based are reasonable, any of those assumptions could prove to be inaccurate, and as a result, the forward-looking statements based on those assumptions also could be inaccurate. In light of these and other uncertainties, the inclusion of any projection or forward-looking statement in this report should not be regarded as a representation by us that our plans and objectives will be achieved. Moreover, we assume no duty and do not undertake to update the forward-looking statements, except as required by applicable law.

 The Company s investment strategy also includes a smaller allocation to more liquid credit investments such as broadly syndicated loans and corporate bonds. The Company intends to use these investments to maintain liquidity for the Company s share repurchase program and to manage cash before investing subscriptions into directly originated, privately negotiated loans, while seeking attractive risk-adjusted investment returns. The Company also may invest in publicly traded debt securities of larger corporate issuers on an opportunistic basis when market conditions create compelling potential return opportunities, subject to compliance with BDC requirements to invest at least 70 of assets in eligible portfolio companies. 
 
 Subscriptions to purchase the Company s Common Shares may be made on an ongoing basis, but investors currently may only purchase the Company s Common Shares pursuant to accepted subscription orders as of the first business day of each month. The Company, in its sole discretion, may determine to accept subscriptions on a less frequent basis than monthly (the Subscription Frequency ). The purchase price for the Common Shares in the Initial Closing was per share. Thereafter, the purchase price per share equals the NAV per share, as of the last calendar day of the month immediately prior to the effective date of the share purchase Valuation Date . HPS Securities, LLC (the Managing Dealer ), and the participating brokers will use their best efforts to sell shares, but are not obligated to purchase or sell any specific amount of shares. The Managing Dealer intends to enter into additional placement agreements with broker-dealers in connection with the private offering of the Company s Common Shares (the Private Offering ). 
 
 On April 8, 2024 (the Initial Closing ), the Company issued unregistered Common Shares in the Company, par value , to certain accredited investors in the Initial Closing of its Private Offering. The terms of the Private Offering required the Company to deposit all subscription proceeds in an escrow account with the Bank of New York Mellon, as escrow agent, until (i) the Company received subscriptions of at least million; and (ii) the Company s Board authorized the release of funds in the escrow account. On April 8, 2024, the Company s Board authorized the release from escrow of the subscription proceeds of approximately million and the Company issued and sold shares to such accredited investors. The offer and sale of the Common Shares was exempt from the registration provisions of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ), pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act, Regulation D thereunder, and/or Regulation S thereunder.

 million and million, respectively (e.g. prepayment premiums, accelerated accretion of upfront loan origination fees and unamortized discounts). 
 Loans are generally placed on non-accrual status when there is reasonable doubt that principal or interest will be collected in full. Accrued interest is generally reversed when a loan is placed on non-accrual status. Additionally, any original issue discount and market discount are no longer accreted to interest income as of the date the loan is placed on non-accrual status. Interest payments received on non-accrual loans may be recognized as income or applied to principal depending upon management s judgment regarding collectability. Non-accrual loans are restored to accrual status when past due principal and interest is paid current and, in management s judgment, are likely to remain current. Management may make exceptions to this treatment and determine to not place a loan on non-accrual status if the loan has sufficient collateral value and is in the process of collection. As of September 30, 2024, th e Company had no investments on non-accrual status. 
 PIK Income 
 The Company has loans in its portfolio that contain payment-in-kind PIK provisions. PIK represents interest that is accrued and recorded as interest income at the contractual rates, increases the loan principal on the respective capitalization dates, and is generally due at maturity. Such income is included in interest income in the Statements of Operations. If at any point the Company believes PIK is not expected to be realized, the investment generating PIK will be placed on non-accrual status. When a PIK investment is placed on non-accrual status, the accrued, uncapitalized interest is generally reversed through interest income. To maintain the Company s status as a RIC, this non-cash source of income must be paid out to shareholders in the form of dividends, even though the Company has not yet collected cash. 
 Dividend Income 
 Dividend income on preferred equity securities is recorded on the accrual basis to the extent that such amounts are payable by the portfolio company and are expected to be collected. Dividend income on common equity securities is recorded on the record date for private portfolio companies or on the ex-dividend date for publicly-traded portfolio companies. To the extent a preferred equity security contains PIK provisions, PIK dividends, computed at the contractual rate specified in each applicable agreement, are accrued and recorded as dividend income and added to the principal balance of the preferred equity security. PIK dividends added to the principal balance are generally collected upon redemption of the equity. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company did t record any dividend income. 
 Other Income 
 The Company may receive various fees in the ordinary course of business such as structuring, consent, waiver, amendment, syndication and other miscellaneous fees as well as fees for managerial assistance rendered by the Company to the portfolio companies. Such fees are recognized as income when earned or the services are rendered.

 components: a management fee and an incentive fee. The cost of both the management fee and the incentive fee will ultimately be borne by the shareholders. 
 
 Base Management Fee 
 
 The management fee will be payable quarterly in arrears at an annual rate of of the value of the Company s net assets as of the beginning of the first calendar day of the applicable quarter, as adjusted for any share issuances or repurchases during the quarter that do not occur on the first calendar day of the quarter. For purposes of the Investment Advisory Agreement, net assets means the Company s total assets less the carrying value of liabilities, determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The payment and calculation of the management fee will be pro-rated for any period of less than three months. For the first calendar quarter in which the Company had operations, net assets were measured as the beginning net assets as of the date on which the Company broke escrow for the Private Offering. 
 
 The Adviser has agreed to waive its base management fee for the first following the Initial Closing. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, base management fees earned were million and million, respectively, all of which were voluntarily waived by the Adviser. As of September 30, 2024, amounts were payable to the Adviser related to management fees. 
 Incentive Fees 
 
 The Company will pay the Adviser an incentive fee. The incentive fee consists of components that are independent of each other, with the result that one component may be payable even if the other is not. A portion of the incentive fee is based on a percentage of the Company s income and a portion is based on a percentage of the Company s capital gains, each as described below.

 per quarter annualized). 
 
 The Company will pay the Adviser an incentive fee quarterly in arrears with respect to the Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns in each calendar quarter as follows: 
 
 a. No incentive fee will be paid on Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns in any calendar quarter in which the Pre- Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns do not exceed the Hurdle Rate of annualized); 
 
 b. of the dollar amount of the Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns with respect to that portion of such Pre- Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns, if any, that exceeds the Hurdle Rate but is less than a rate of return of annualized). This portion of the Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns (which exceeds the Hurdle Rate but is less than is referred to as the Catch-Up. The Catch-Up is meant to provide the Adviser with approximately of the Company's Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns as if a Hurdle Rate did not apply if the net investment income exceeds in any calendar quarter; and 
 
 c. of the dollar amount of the Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns, if any, that exceed a rate of return of annualized). This reflects that once the Hurdle Rate is reached and the Catch-Up is achieved, of all Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income Returns thereafter are allocated to the Adviser. 
 
 The Adviser has agreed to waive its income based incentive fee for the first six months following the Initial Closing. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , income based incentive fees were million and million , respectively, all of which was voluntarily waived by the Adviser. As of September 30, 2024 , amounts were payable to the Adviser relating to income based incentive fees. 
 
 Capital gains based incentive fee 
 
 The second component of the incentive fee, the capital gains incentive fee, is payable at the end of each calendar year in arrears. The amount payable equals of cumulative realized capital gains from inception through the end of such calendar year, computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation on a cumulative basis, less the aggregate amount of any previously paid incentive fee on capital gains as calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. U.S. GAAP requires that the capital gains incentive fee accrual consider the cumulative aggregate unrealized capital appreciation in the calculation, as a capital gains incentive fee would be payable if such unrealized capital appreciation were realized, even though such unrealized capital appreciation is not permitted to be considered in calculating the fee actually payable under the Investment Advisory Agreement. This U.S. GAAP accrual is calculated using the aggregate cumulative realized capital gains and losses and aggregate cumulative unrealized capital depreciation included in the calculation of the capital gains incentive fee plus the aggregate cumulative unrealized capital appreciation, net of any expense associated with cumulative unrealized capital depreciation or appreciation. If such amount is positive at the end of a period, then U.S. GAAP requires the Company to record a capital gains incentive fee equal to of such cumulative amount, less the aggregate amount of actual capital gains incentive fees paid or capital gains incentive fees accrued under U.S. GAAP in all prior periods. 
 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , capital gains incentive fees were million and million, respectively, none of which were payable under the Investment Advisory Agreement.

 Expense Support and Conditional Reimbursement Agreement 
 
 The Company has entered into an Expense Support and Conditional Reimbursement Agreement with the Adviser (the Expense Support Agreement ). Pursuant to the Expense Support Agreement, the Adviser may elect to pay certain expenses on the Company s behalf (an Expense Payment ), provided that no portion of the payment will be used to pay any interest expense or shareholder servicing and/or distribution fees of the Company. Any Expense Payment that the Adviser has committed to pay must be paid by the Adviser to the Company in any combination of cash or other immediately available funds no later than after such commitment was made in writing, and/or offset against amounts due from the Company to the Adviser or its affiliates. 
 
 Following any calendar quarter in which Available Operating Funds (as defined below) exceed the cumulative distributions accrued to the Company s shareholders based on distributions declared with respect to record dates occurring in such calendar quarter (the amount of such excess being hereinafter referred to as Excess Operating Funds ), the Company shall pay such Excess Operating Funds, or a portion thereof, to the Adviser until such time as all Expense Payments made by the Adviser to the Company within three years prior to the last business day of such calendar quarter have been reimbursed. Any payments required to be made by the Company shall be referred to herein as a Reimbursement Payment. 
 
 Available Operating Funds means the sum of (i) the Company s net investment company taxable income (including net short-term capital gains reduced by net long-term capital losses), (ii) the Company s net capital gains (including the excess of net long-term capital gains over net short-term capital losses) and (iii) dividends and other distributions paid to the Company on account of investments in portfolio companies (to the extent such amounts listed in clause (iii) are not included under clauses (i) and (ii) above). 
 
 Reimbursement Payment for any quarter shall be made if: (1) the Effective Rate of Distributions Per Share declared by the Company at the time of such Reimbursement Payment is less than the Effective Rate of Distributions Per Share at the time the Expense Payment was made to which such Reimbursement Payment relates, or (2) the Company s Operating Expense Ratio at the time of such Reimbursement Payment is greater than the Operating Expense Ratio at the time the Expense Payment was made to which such Reimbursement Payment relates. Effective Rate of Distributions Per Share means the annualized rate (based on a 12-month year) of regular cash distributions per share exclusive of returns of capital, distribution rate reductions due to shareholder servicing and/or distribution fees, and declared special dividends or special distributions, if any. The Operating Expense Ratio is calculated by dividing Operating Expenses, less organizational and offering expenses, base management and incentive fees owed to the Adviser, shareholder servicing and/or distribution fees, and interest expense, by the Company s net assets. Operating Expenses means all of the Company s

 Note 5. 
 In certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In such cases, an investment s level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the overall fair value measurement. The Adviser s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment, and considers factors specific to the investment. 
 In addition to using the above inputs in investment valuations, the Company applies the valuation policy approved by its Board that is consistent with ASC 820. Consistent with the valuation policy, the Company evaluates the source of the inputs, including any markets in which its investments are trading (or any markets in which securities with similar attributes are trading), in determining fair value. 
 Investments whose values are based on the listed closing price quoted on the securities principal exchange are classified within Level 1 and include active listed equities. The Adviser does not adjust the quoted price for such instruments, even in situations where the Company holds a large position and a sale could reasonably impact the quoted price. 
 
 Investments that trade in markets that are not considered to be active, but are valued based on quoted market prices, dealer quotations or alternative pricing sources supported by observable inputs are classified within Level 2. These include investment-grade corporate bonds, structured products, and certain bank loans, less liquid listed equities, and high yield bonds. As Level 2 investments include positions that are not traded in active markets and/or are subject to transfer restrictions, valuations may be adjusted to reflect illiquidity and/or non-transferability, which are generally based on available market information. 
 
 Investments classified within Level 3 have unobservable inputs, as they trade infrequently, or not at all. When observable prices are not available for these investments, the Adviser uses one or more valuation techniques (e.g., the market approach and the income approach) of which sufficient and reliable data is available. Within Level 3, the use of the market approach generally consists of using comparable market data, while the use of the income approach generally consists of the net present value of estimated future cash flows, which may be adjusted as appropriate for liquidity, credit, market and/or other risk factors. 
 
 Investments in senior loans primarily include first and second lien term loans, delayed draws and revolving credit. The Adviser analyzes enterprise value based on the weighted average of discounted cash flows, public comparables and merger and acquisition comparables. This analysis is done to ensure, among other things, that the investments have adequate collateral and asset coverage. Once the investment is determined to have adequate asset coverage, the Adviser monitors yields for senior loan investments made from the time of purchase to the month end average yields for similar investments and risk profiles. The Company uses market data, including newly funded transactions, and secondary market data with respect to high-yield debt instruments and syndicated loans, as inputs in determining the appropriate market yield. The change in yield is utilized by the Adviser to discount the anticipated cash flows of the debt investment in order to arrive at a fair value. Further, the Adviser adjusts for material changes in the underlying fundamentals of the issuer, including changes in leverage, as necessary. If the investment does not have adequate coverage, a tranched valuation approach is considered.

 (2) Weighted averages are calculated based on fair value of investments. 
 The significant unobservable input used in the yield analysis is the discount rate based on comparable market yields. Significant increases in discount rates would result in a significantly lower fair value measurement. 
 Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of the Company s investments may fluctuate from period to period. Additionally, the fair value of the Company s investments may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market existed for such investments and may differ materially from the values that the Company may ultimately realize. Further, such investments are generally subject to legal and other restrictions on resale or otherwise are less liquid than publicly traded securities. If the Company was required to liquidate a portfolio investment in a forced or liquidation sale, it could realize significantly less than the value at which the Company has recorded it. In addition, changes in the market environment and other events that may occur over the life of the investments may cause the gains or losses ultimately realized on these investments to be different than the unrealized gains or losses reflected in the valuations currently assigned. 
 Financial Instruments Not Carried at Fair Value 
 Debt 
 The fair value of the Company s credit facility, which would be categorized as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy, as of September 30, 2024, approximates its carrying value as the credit facility has a variable interest based on selected short term rates. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, the carrying amounts of the Company s assets and liabilities, other than investments at fair value and debt, approximate fair value due to their short maturities. Fair value is estimated by discounting remaining payments using applicable current market rates, which take into account changes in the Company s marketplace credit ratings, if applicable, or market quotes, if available.

 Distribution Reinvestment Plan 
 The Company has adopted a distribution reinvestment plan, pursuant to which the Company will reinvest all cash distributions declared by the Company on behalf of the Company s shareholders who do not elect to receive their distributions in cash as provided below. As a result, if the Company declares a cash distribution, then shareholders who have not opted out of the Company s distribution reinvestment plan will have their cash distributions automatically reinvested in additional shares as described below, rather than receiving the cash distribution. Distributions on fractional shares will be credited to each participating shareholder s account to three decimal places. 
 Character of Distributions 
 The Company may fund its cash distributions to shareholders from any source of funds available to the Company, including but not limited to offering proceeds, net investment income from operations, capital gains proceeds from the sale of assets, borrowings, dividends or other distributions paid to it on account of preferred and common equity investments in portfolio companies and expense support from the Adviser, which is subject to recoupment. 
 Through September 30, 2024, a portion of the Company s distributions resulted from expense support from the Adviser, and future distributions may result from expense support from the Adviser, each of which is subject to repayment by the Company within from the date of payment. The purpose of this arrangement avoids distributions being characterized as a return of capital for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Shareholders should understand that any such distribution is not based solely on the Company s investment performance, and can only be sustained if the Company achieves positive investment performance in future periods and/or the Adviser continues to provide expense support. Shareholders should also understand that the Company s future repayments of expense support will reduce the distributions that they would otherwise receive. There can be no assurance that the Company will achieve the performance necessary to sustain these distributions, or be able to pay distributions at all. 
 Sources of distributions, other than net investment income and realized gains on a U.S. GAAP basis, include required adjustments to U.S. GAAP net investment income in the current period to determine taxable income available for distributions.

 Share Repurchase Program 
 
 Beginning no later than the first full calendar quarter from the date on which the Company breaks escrow for the Company s initial offering of its common shares, and at the discretion of the Company s Board, the Company intends to commence a share repurchase program in which the Company may repurchase, in each quarter, up to of the Company s Common Shares outstanding (by number of shares) as of the close of the previous calendar quarter. The Company s Board may amend, suspend or terminate the share repurchase program if it deems such action to be in the Company s best interest and the best interest of the Company s shareholders. As a result, share repurchases may not be available each quarter. 
 
 The Company expects to repurchase shares pursuant to tender offers each quarter using a purchase price equal to the NAV per share as of the last calendar day of the applicable quarter, except that shares that have not been outstanding for at least one year (or, in the case of shareholders who purchased shares in the Initial Closing, until at least March 31, 2025) will be repurchased at of the applicable NAV per share (the Early Repurchase Deduction ). The holding period is measured as of the subscription closing date immediately following the prospective repurchase date. The Early Repurchase Deduction may be waived, at the Company s discretion, in the case of repurchase requests arising from the death, divorce or qualified disability of the holder. The Early Repurchase Deduction will be retained by the Company for the benefit of remaining shareholders. The Company intends to conduct the repurchase offers in accordance with the requirements of Rule 13e-4 promulgated under the Exchange Act and the 1940 Act. All shares purchased by the Company pursuant to the terms of each tender offer will be retired and thereafter will be authorized and unissued shares. 
 
 There were share repurchases during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 .

 Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 
 The information contained in this section should be read in conjunction with Item 1. Financial Statements. This discussion contains forward-looking statements, which relate to future events, our future performance or financial condition and involves numerous risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those implied or expressed in any forward-looking statements. 
 
 Overview and Investment Framework 
 We are a newly organized, externally managed, non-diversified closed-end management investment company that has elected to be regulated as a BDC under the 1940 Act. Formed as a Delaware statutory trust on August 10, 2023, we are externally managed by the Adviser, which is responsible for determining the portfolio composition, making investment decisions, monitoring investments, performing due diligence on prospective portfolio companies and providing us with such other investment advisory and related services as may reasonably be required for the investment of capital. We intend to elect to be treated for federal income tax purposes, and intend to qualify annually thereafter, as a RIC under the Code. 
 
 We are a privately placed, perpetual-life BDC, which is a BDC whose shares are not listed for trading on a stock exchange or other securities market. We use the term perpetual-life BDC to describe an investment vehicle of indefinite duration, whose Common Shares are intended to be sold on a continuous basis at regular frequency by the BDC at a price generally equal to the BDC s NAV per share. The Common Shares described herein have not been registered under the Securities Act, the securities laws of any other state or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction. The Common Shares will be offered and sold under the exemption from registration under the Securities Act under Regulation D and Regulation S. Each purchaser will be required to represent that it is (i) either an accredited investor as defined in Rule 501 of Regulation D under the Securities Act or, in the case of Common Shares sold outside the United States, not a U.S. person in accordance with Regulation S of the Securities Act and (ii) acquiring the Common Shares purchased by it for investment and not with a view to resale or distribution. 
 
 We do not intend to list our Common Shares on any securities exchange and our Common Shares will not be publicly traded. It is currently anticipated that within one year of the date on which we break escrow for our initial offering of Common Shares, the Company will merge with and into an affiliated publicly offered, non-traded BDC (the Non-Traded BDC having the same investment adviser, substantially the same investment objectives and policies as the Company and the same management and advisory fees as the Company (the Merger ), and that holders of our Common Shares will receive Common Shares of the Non-Traded BDC pursuant to the Merger. However, there can be no assurance the Merger will occur, and we may instead continue as a perpetually offered, privately placed BDC. 
 
 To the extent the Merger does occur, it will be structured with the intent to qualify as a tax-free reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, and Simpson Thacher Bartlett LLP will deliver an opinion that the Merger should qualify for such treatment. 
 
 Subscriptions to purchase our Common Shares may be made on an ongoing basis, but investors currently may only purchase our Common Shares pursuant to accepted subscription orders as of the first business day of each month. The Company, in its sole discretion, may determine to accept subscriptions on a less frequent basis than monthly and currently expects that it will begin accepting subscriptions on a quarterly (as opposed to monthly) basis (the Subscription Frequency within six to twelve months following the Initial Closing. However, we may determine to change the Subscription Frequency sooner or later, or not at all. The purchase price for the Common Shares in the Initial Closing was 25.00 per share. Thereafter, the purchase price per share equals the NAV per share, as of the last calendar day of the month immediately prior to the effective date of the share purchase Valuation Date ). The Managing Dealer and the participating brokers will use their best efforts to sell shares, but are not obligated to purchase or sell any specific amount of shares. The Managing Dealer intends to enter into additional placement agreements with broker-dealers in connection with the private offering of our Common Shares. 
 
 Under our Investment Advisory Agreement, we have agreed to pay the Adviser a fee for its services. The fee consists of two components: a management fee and an incentive fee. The cost of both the management and incentive fee will ultimately be borne by the shareholders. Also, under the Administration Agreement, we have agreed to reimburse the Administrator for the costs and expenses incurred by the Administrator in performing its obligations under the Administration Agreement. Such reimbursement includes our allocable portion of compensation (including salaries, bonuses and benefits), and may include overhead (including rent, office equipment and utilities) and other expenses incurred by the Administrator in performing its administrative obligations under the Administration Agreement, including but not limited to compensation paid to: (i) our chief compliance officer, chief financial officer and their respective staffs; (ii) investor relations, legal, operations and other non-investment professionals at the Administrator that perform duties for us; and (iii) any internal audit group personnel of the Administrator or any of its affiliates, subject to the limitations described in Advisory and Administration Agreements. In addition, pursuant to the terms of the Administration Agreement, the Administrator may delegate its obligations under the Administration Agreement to an affiliate or to a third party and we will reimburse the Administrator for any services performed for us by such affiliate or third party.

Our investment objective is to produce attractive, risk-adjusted returns in the form of current income and long-term capital appreciation by investing primarily (generally expected to be 80 - 90 of the portfolio) in newly originated, privately negotiated senior secured debt and junior capital of upper middle market and larger scale companies predominantly in the U.S. We use the term upper middle market to generally refer to companies with EBITDA of 75 million to 1 billion annually or revenue of 250 million to 5 billion annually at the time of our investment. 
 
 We may invest in smaller companies if the opportunity presents attractive investment characteristics and risk-adjusted returns. While our investment strategy focuses primarily on companies in the United States, we also intend to leverage HPS s global presence to invest in companies in Europe, Australia and other locations outside of the U.S. subject to compliance with BDC requirements to invest at least 70 assets in eligible portfolio companies . 
 
 Our investment strategy also includes a smaller allocation (generally expected to be 10 - 20 of the portfolio) to more liquid credit investments such as broadly syndicated loans and corporate bonds. We intend to use these investments to maintain liquidity for our share repurchase program and to manage cash before investing subscriptions into directly originated, privately negotiated loans, while seeking attractive risk-adjusted investment returns. We also may invest in publicly traded debt securities of larger corporate issuers on an opportunistic basis when market conditions create compelling potential return opportunities, subject to compliance with BDC requirements to invest at least 70 of assets in eligible portfolio companies. 
 
 Under normal circumstances, we will invest at least 80 of our net assets plus borrowings for investment purposes in capital instruments (securities throughout the capital structure of a company) issued by corporate issuers (including loans, notes, bonds and other corporate debt or equity securities). 
 
 We intend to use leverage to seek to enhance our returns. Our leverage levels will vary over time in response to general market conditions, the size and composition of our investment portfolio and the views of our Adviser and Board. We expect that our debt to equity ratio will generally range between 0.5x and 1.0x. While our leverage employed may be greater or less than these levels from time to time, including until such time that we have raised substantial proceeds in this offering and acquired a diversified portfolio of investments, we are subject to the limitations set forth in the 1940 Act, which currently allows us to borrow up to a 2:1 debt to equity ratio. 
 
 Our leverage may take the form of revolving or term loans from financial institutions, secured or unsecured bonds, or securitization of portions of our investment portfolio via collateralized loan obligations or preferred shares. When determining whether to borrow money and assessing the various borrowing structure alternatives, we analyze the maturity, rate structure and covenant package of the proposed borrowings in the context of our investment portfolio, pre-existing borrowings and market outlook. 
 
 The Company and the Adviser have received an exemptive order from the SEC that permits the Company to co-invest with certain other persons, including certain affiliated accounts managed and controlled by the Adviser or its affiliates. Subject to the 1940 Act and the conditions of any such co-investment order issued by the SEC, we may, under certain circumstances, co-invest with certain affiliated accounts in investments that are suitable for us and one or more of such affiliated accounts. 
 
 Key Components of Our Results of Operations 
 Revenues 
 We generate revenues in the form of interest and fee income on debt investments, capital gains, and dividend income from our equity investments in our portfolio companies. Our senior and subordinated debt investments are expected to bear interest at a fixed or floating rate. Interest on debt securities is generally payable monthly, quarterly or semiannually. In some cases, some of our investments may provide for deferred interest payments or PIK interest. The principal amount of the debt securities and any accrued but unpaid PIK interest generally will become due at the maturity date. In addition, we may generate revenue from various fees in the ordinary course of business in connection with transactions. Original issue discounts and market discounts or premiums will be capitalized, and we will accrete or amortize such amounts as interest income. We will record prepayment premiums on loans and debt securities as interest income. Dividend income, if any, will be recognized on an accrual basis to the extent that we expect to collect such amounts. 
 Expenses 
 Except as specifically provided below, all investment professionals and staff of the Adviser, when and to the extent engaged in providing investment advisory services to us, and the base compensation, bonus and benefits, and the routine overhead expenses, of such personnel allocable to such services, will be provided and paid for by the Adviser. We will bear all other costs and expenses of our operations, administration and transactions, including, but not limited to:

investment advisory fees, including management fees and incentive fees, to the Adviser, pursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement; 
 
 our allocable portion of compensation (including salaries, bonuses and benefits), overhead (including rent, office equipment and utilities) and other expenses incurred by the Administrator in performing its administrative obligations under the Administration Agreement, including but not limited to: (i) our chief compliance officer, chief financial officer and their respective staffs; (ii) investor relations, legal, operations and other non-investment professionals at the Administrator that perform duties for us; and (iii) any internal audit group personnel of HPS or any of its affiliates; and 
 
 all other expenses of the Company s operations, administrations and transactions. 
 
 Under the Expense Support Agreement, the Adviser agreed to advance all of our organization and offering expenses on our behalf through April 8, 2024, the date on which we broke escrow for our initial offering of Common Shares. We are obligated to reimburse the Adviser for such advanced expenses (including any additional expenses the Adviser elects to pays on our behalf), subject to the provisions of the Expense Support Agreement. Any reimbursements will not exceed actual expenses incurred by the Adviser and its affiliates. 
 
 From time to time, the Adviser, the Administrator or their affiliates may pay third-party providers of goods or services. We will reimburse the Adviser, the Administrator or such affiliates thereof for any such amounts paid on our behalf. From time to time, the Adviser and the Administrator may defer or waive fees and/or rights to be reimbursed for expenses. All of the foregoing expenses will ultimately be borne by our shareholders. 
 
 Costs and expenses of the Adviser and the Administrator that are eligible for reimbursement by us will be reasonably allocated to us on the basis of time spent, assets under management, usage rates, proportionate holdings, a combination thereof or other reasonable methods determined by the Administrator. 
 Expense Support and Conditional Reimbursement Agreement 
 We have entered into an Expense Support Agreement with the Adviser. F or additional information see Note 3. Fees, Expenses, Agreements and Related Party Transactions to the financial statements.

 Our Adviser monitors the financial trends of each portfolio company on an ongoing basis to determine if it is meeting its respective business plan and to assess the appropriate course of action for each company. Our Adviser has several methods of evaluating and monitoring the performance and fair value of our investments, which may include, but are not limited to, the following: 
 assessment of success in adhering to the portfolio company s business plan and compliance with covenants; 
 periodic or regular contact with portfolio company management and, if appropriate, the financial or strategic sponsor to discuss financial position, requirements and accomplishments; 
 comparisons to our other portfolio companies in the industry, if any; 
 attendance at and participation in board meetings or presentations by portfolio companies; and 
 review of monthly and quarterly financial statements and financial projections of portfolio companies.

 Capital Gains Incentive Fees 
 U.S. GAAP requires that the capital gains incentive fee accrual consider the cumulative aggregate unrealized capital appreciation in the calculation, as a capital gains incentive fee would be payable if such unrealized capital appreciation were realized, even though such unrealized capital appreciation is not permitted to be considered in calculating the fee actually payable under the Investment Advisory Agreement. This GAAP accrual is calculated using the aggregate cumulative realized capital gains and losses and aggregate cumulative unrealized capital depreciation included in the calculation of the capital gains incentive fee plus the aggregate cumulative unrealized capital appreciation, net of any expense associated with cumulative unrealized capital depreciation or appreciation. If such amount is positive at the end of a period, then GAAP requires the Company to record a capital gains incentive fee equal to 15.0 of such cumulative amount, less the aggregate amount of actual capital gains incentive fees paid or capital gains incentive fees accrued under GAAP in all prior periods. 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, capital gains based incentive fees were 0.1 million and 0.4 million, respectively, primarily due to net unrealized gains on investments, none of which were payable under the Investment Advisory Agreement. The accrual for any capital gains incentive fee under U.S. GAAP in a given period may result in an additional expense if such cumulative amount is greater than in the prior period or a reduction of previously recorded expense if such cumulative amount is less in the prior period. If such cumulative amount is negative, then there is no accrual. 
 Other Expenses 
 Organization costs and offering costs include expenses incurred in our initial formation and our continuous offering. Professional fees include legal, audit, tax, valuation, and other professional fees incurred related to the management of the Company. Administrative service expenses represent fees paid to the Administrator for our allocable portion of overhead and other expenses incurred by the Administrator in performing its obligations under the administration agreement, including our allocable portion of the cost of certain of our executive officers, their respective staff and other non-investment professionals that perform duties for us. Other general and administrative expenses include insurance, filing, research, our sub-administrator, subscriptions and other costs. 
 
 Total other expenses were 1.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, primarily comprised of 0.4 million of general and administrative expenses (including fees paid to our sub-administrator and transfer agent), 0.3 million of professional fees (including legal, audit and tax) and 0.5 million of offering costs. 
 
 Total other expenses were 3.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily comprised of 0.9 million of general and administrative expenses (including fees paid to our sub-administrator and transfer agent), 0.7 million of professional fees (including legal, audit and tax) and 0.8 million of offering costs. 
 
 The Managing Dealer has agreed to waive the shareholder servicing and/or distribution fee for the first six months following the 
 Initial Closing. All other expenses were borne by the Adviser, subject to future reimbursement pursuant to terms of the Expense Support Agreement. 
 Under the terms of the Administration Agreement and Investment Management Agreement, we reimburse the Administrator and Adviser, respectively, for services performed for us. In addition, pursuant to the terms of these agreements, the Administrator and Adviser may delegate its obligations under these agreements to an affiliate or to a third party and we reimburse the Administrator and Adviser for any services performed for us by such affiliate or third party. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Administrator charged 0.4 million and 0.7 million, respectively, for certain costs and expenses allocable to the Company under the terms of the Administration Agreement, all of which were borne by the Adviser, subject to future reimbursement pursuant to the terms of the Expense Support Agreement. 
 
 We entered into an Expense Support Agreement with the Adviser. For additional information see Note 3. Fees, Expenses, Agreements and Related Party Transactions to the financial statements. 
 Income Taxes, Including Excise Taxes 
 We intend to elect to be treated as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code, and we intend to operate in a manner so as to continue to qualify each taxable year for the tax treatment applicable to RICs. To qualify for tax treatment as a RIC, we must, among other things, distribute to our shareholders in each taxable year generally at least 90 of the sum of our investment company taxable income, as defined by the Code (without regard to the deduction for dividends paid), and net tax-exempt income (if any) for that taxable year. To maintain our tax treatment as a RIC, we, among other things, intend to make the requisite distributions to our shareholders, which generally relieve us from corporate-level U.S. federal income taxes.

Table of Contents 

 Depending on the level of taxable income earned in a tax year, we may carry forward taxable income (including net capital gains, if any) in excess of current year distributions from the current tax year into the next tax year and pay a nondeductible 4 U.S. federal excise tax on such taxable income, as required. To the extent that we determine that our estimated current year annual taxable income will be in excess of estimated current year distributions from such income, we will accrue excise tax on estimated excess taxable income. 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we incurred 0.3 million and 0.3 million of U.S. federal excise tax, respectively.

 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the fair value of our debt investments increased due to spread tightening in the private credit markets. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 we generated foreign currency unrealized gains of 2.1 million on investments (included in unrealized gains on non-controlled/non-affiliated investments) primarily as a result of fluctuations in the GBP and EUR exchange rates. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the fair value of our debt investments increased due to spread tightening in the private credit markets. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 we generated foreign currency unrealized gains of 1.5 million on investments (included in unrealized gains on non-controlled/non-affiliated investments) primarily as a result of fluctuations in the GBP and EUR exchange rates. 
 
 Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 We generate cash primarily from the net proceeds of our continuous offering of Common Shares, proceeds from net borrowings on our credit facility, short-term borrowings, income earned and repayments on principal on our debt investments. The primary uses of our cash and cash equivalents are for (i) originating and purchasing debt investments, (ii) funding the costs of our operations (including fees paid to our Adviser and expense reimbursements paid to our Administrator), (iii) debt service, repayment and other financing costs of our borrowings, (iv) funding repurchases under our share repurchase program and (v) cash distributions to our shareholders. 
 As of September 30, 2024 , we had one corporate-level revolving credit facility. From time to time, we may enter into additional credit facilities, increase the size of our existing credit facilities and/or issue debt securities, including unsecured notes. In accordance with the 1940 Act, with certain limited exceptions, we are only allowed to incur borrowings, issue debt securities or issue preferred stock, if immediately after the borrowing or issuance, the ratio of total assets (less total liabilities other than indebtedness) to total indebtedness plus 
 44 

Table of Contents 

 preferred stock, is at least 150 . As of September 30, 2024, we had an aggregate amount of 138.8 million of debt outstanding and our asset coverage ratio was 504.3 . We seek to carefully consider our unfunded commitments for the purpose of planning our ongoing financial leverage. 
 Cash and cash equivalents as of September 30, 2024, taken together with our 436.2 million of available capacity under our credit facility (subject to borrowing base availability) and the continuous offering of our Common Shares is expected to be sufficient for our investing activities and to conduct our operations in the near term. This determination is based in part on our expectations for the timing of funding investment purchases and the timing and amount of future proceeds from sales of our Common Shares and the use of existing and future financing arrangements. As of September 30, 2024, we had significant amounts payable and commitments for existing and new investments, which we planned to fund using proceeds from offering our Common Shares and available borrowing capacity under our credit facility. Additionally, we held 165.8 million of Level 2 investments as of September 30, 2024, which could provide additional liquidity if necessary. 
 Although we were able to close on a credit facility during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, any disruption in the financial markets or any other negative economic development could restrict our access to financing in the future. We may not be able to find new financing for future investments or liquidity needs and, even if we are able to obtain such financing, such financing may not be on as favorable terms as we could have obtained in the past. These factors may limit our ability to make new investments and adversely impact our results of operations. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 8.7 million in cash and cash equivalents. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, cash used in operating activities was 665.6 million, primarily as a result of funding portfolio investments of 733.8 million, partially offset by proceeds from sale of investments and principal repayments of 36.7 million and other operating uses of 31.5 million. Cash provided by financing activities was 674.3 million during the period, primarily as a result of new share issuances related to 543.0 million of subscriptions and net borrowings of 138.8 million.

 With respect to distributions, we have adopted an opt out distribution reinvestment plan for shareholders. As a result, in the event of a declared cash distribution or other distribution, each shareholder that has not opted out of the distribution reinvestment plan will have their distributions automatically reinvested in additional shares rather than receiving cash distributions. Shareholders who receive distributions in the form of shares will be subject to the same U.S. federal, state and local tax consequences as if they received cash distributions. 
 Sources of distributions, other than net investment income and realized gains on a U.S. GAAP basis, include required adjustments to U.S. GAAP net investment income in the current period to determine taxable income available for distributions. The following tables reflect the sources of cash distributions on a U.S. GAAP basis that we declared on our Common Shares during the nine months ended September 30, 2024:

 Share Repur chase Program 
 
 Beginning no later than the first full calendar quarter from the date on which we break escrow for the initial offering of our Common Shares, and at the discretion of our Board, we intend to commence a share repurchase program in which the we may repurchase, in each quarter, up to 5 of our Common Shares outstanding (by number of shares) as of the close of the previous calendar quarter. Our Board may amend, suspend or terminate the share repurchase program at any time in its discretion. As a result, share repurchases may not be available each quarter. Upon a suspension of our share repurchase program, our Board will consider at least quarterly whether the continued suspension of our share repurchase program remains in our best interest and the best interest of our shareholders. However, our Board is not required to authorize the recommencement of our share repurchase program within any specified period of time. Our Board may also determine to terminate our share repurchase program if required by applicable law or in connection with a transaction in which our shareholders receive liquidity for their Common Shares, such as a sale or merger of the Company or listing of our Common Shares on a national securities exchange. 
 
 Under the share repurchase program, to the extent we offer to repurchase shares in any particular quarter, we expect to repurchase shares pursuant to tender offers each quarter using a purchase price equal to the NAV per share as of the last calendar day of the applicable quarter, except that shares that have not been outstanding for at least one year (or, in the case of shareholders who purchased shares in the Initial Closing, until at least March 31, 2025) will be repurchased at 98 of the applicable NAV per share (the Early Repurchase Deduction ). The one-year holding period is measured as of the subscription closing date immediately following the prospective repurchase date. The Early Repurchase Deduction may be waived, at our discretion, in the case of repurchase requests arising from the death, divorce or qualified disability of the holder. The Early Repurchase Deduction will be retained by us for the benefit of remaining shareholders. We intend to conduct the repurchase offers in accordance with the requirements of Rule 13e-4 promulgated under the Exchange Act and the 1940 Act. All shares purchased by us pursuant to the terms of each tender offer will be retired and thereafter will be authorized and unissued shares.

 Recent Developments 
 See Item 1. Financial Statements Notes to Financial Statements Note 11. Subsequent Events for a summary of recent developments. 
 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 
 The preparation of the financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Changes in the economic environment, financial markets, and any other parameters used in determining such estimates could cause actual results to differ. 
 Investments and Fair Value Measurements 
 The Company is required to report its investments for which current market values are not readily available at fair value. The Company values its investments in accordance with ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement, which defines fair value as the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the applicable measurement date. ASC 820 prioritizes the use of observable market prices derived from such prices over entity-specific inputs. Due to the inherent uncertainties of valuation, certain estimated fair values may differ significantly from the values that would have been realized had a ready market for these investments existed, and these differences could be material. 
 Investments that are listed or traded on an exchange and are freely transferable are valued at either the closing price (in the case of securities and futures) or the mean of the closing bid and offer (in the case of options) on the principal exchange on which the investment is listed or traded. Investments for which other market quotations are readily available will typically be valued at those market quotations. To validate market quotations, the Company utilizes a number of factors to determine if the quotations are representative of fair value, including the source and number of the quotations. Where it is possible to obtain reliable, independent market quotations from a third party vendor, the Company uses these quotations to determine the value of its investments. The Company utilizes mid-market pricing (i.e., mid-point of average bid and ask prices) to value these investments. The Adviser obtains these market quotations from independent pricing services, if available; otherwise from one or more broker quotes. To assess the continuing appropriateness of pricing sources and methodologies, the Adviser regularly performs price verification procedures and issues challenges as necessary to independent pricing services or brokers, and any differences are reviewed in accordance with the valuation procedures. The Adviser does not adjust the prices unless it has a reason to believe market quotations are not reflective of the fair value of an investment. 
 
 Where prices or inputs are not available or, in the judgment of the Adviser, not reliable, valuation approaches based on the facts and circumstances of the particular investment will be utilized. Securities that are not publicly traded or for which market prices are not readily available, as will be the case for a substantial portion of the Company s investments, are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by the Adviser as the Company s valuation designee under Rule 2a-5 under the 1940 Act, pursuant to the Company s valuation policy, and under the oversight of the Board, based on, among other things, the input of one or more independent valuation firms retained by the Company to review the Company s investments. These valuation approaches involve some level of management estimation and judgment, the degree of which is dependent on the price transparency for the investments or market and the investments complexity. 
 48 

Table of Contents 

 With respect to the quarterly valuation of investments, the Company undertakes a multi-step valuation process each quarter in connection with determining the fair value of our investments for which reliable market quotations are not readily available as of the last calendar day of each quarter, which includes, among other procedures, the following: 
 The valuation process begins with each investment being preliminarily valued by the Adviser s valuation team in consultation with the Adviser s investment professionals responsible for each portfolio investment; 
 In addition, independent valuation firms retained by the Company prepare quarter-end valuations of each such investment that was (i) originated or purchased prior to the first calendar day of the quarter and (ii) is not a de minimis investment, as determined by the Adviser. The independent valuation firms provide a final range of values on such investments to the Adviser. The independent valuation firms also provide analyses to support their valuation methodology and calculations; 
 The Adviser s Valuation Committee with respect to the Company reviews the valuation recommendations prepared by the Adviser s valuation team and, as appropriate, the independent valuation firms valuation ranges; 
 The Adviser s Valuation Committee then determines fair value marks for each of the Company s portfolio investments; and 
 The Board and Audit Committee periodically review the valuation process and provide oversight in accordance with the requirements of Rule 2a-5 under the 1940 Act. 
 
 As part of the valuation process, the Company takes into account relevant factors in determining the fair value of our investments for which reliable market quotations are not readily available, many of which are loans, including and in combination, as relevant, of: (i) the estimated enterprise value of a portfolio company, generally based on an analysis of discounted cash flows, publicly traded comparable companies and comparable transactions, (ii) the nature and realizable value of any collateral, (iii) the portfolio company s ability to make payments based on its earnings and cash flow, (iv) the markets in which the portfolio company does business, and (v) overall changes in the interest rate environment and the credit markets that may affect the price at which similar investments may be made in the future. When an external event such as a purchase transaction, public offering or subsequent equity or debt sale occurs, the Adviser considers whether the pricing indicated by the external event corroborates its valuation. 
 The Company has and will continue to engage independent valuation firms to provide assistance regarding the determination of the fair value of the Company s portfolio securities for which market quotations are not readily available or are readily available but deemed not reflective of the fair value of the investment each quarter, and the Company and the Adviser may reasonably rely on that assistance. However, the Adviser is responsible for the ultimate valuation of the portfolio investments at fair value as determined in good faith pursuant to the Company s valuation policy, the Board s oversight and a consistently applied valuation process. 
 The fair value of a financial instrument is the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the applicable measurement date. 
 The Company s accounting policy on the fair value of our investments is critical because the determination of fair value involves subjective judgments and estimates. Accordingly, the notes to the Company s financial statements express the uncertainty with respect to the possible effect of these valuations, and any change in these valuations, on the financial statements. 
 See Note 5. Fair Value Measurements to the financial statements for more information on the fair value of the Company s investments. 
 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 We will be subject to financial market risks, including valuation risk and interest rate risk. 
 Valuation Risk 
 
 The Company has invested, and plan to continue to invest, primarily in illiquid debt and equity securities of private companies. Most of our investments will not have a readily available market price, and we value these investments at fair value as determined in good faith by the Adviser as the Company s valuation designee under Rule 2a-5 under the 1940 Act, based on, among other things, the input of independent third-party valuation firms retained by the Company, and in accordance with our valuation policy. There is no single standard for determining fair value. As a result, determining fair value requires that judgment be applied to the specific facts and circumstances of each portfolio investment while employing a consistently applied valuation process for the types of investments we make. If we were required to liquidate a portfolio investment in a forced or liquidation sale, we may realize amounts that are different from the amounts presented and such differences could be material. 
 49 

Table of Contents 

 Interest Rate Risk 
 Interest rate sensitivity refers to the change in earnings that may result from changes in the level of interest rates. We intend to fund portions of our investments with borrowings, and at such time, our net investment income will be affected by the difference between the rate at which we invest and the rate at which we borrow. Accordingly, we cannot assure shareholders that a significant change in market interest rates will not have a material adverse effect on our net investment income. 
 As of September 30, 2024, 92.5 of our performing debt investments at fair value were at floating rates. Based on our Statements of Assets and Liabilities as of September 30, 2024, the following table shows the annualized impact on net income of hypothetical base rate changes in interest rates (considering base rate floors and ceilings for floating rate instruments) and assuming no changes in our investment and borrowing structure: 
 Interest Income Interest Expense Net Income Up 300 basis points 18,100 (4,164) 13,936 Up 200 basis points 12,067 (2,776) 9,291 Up 100 basis points 6,033 (1,388) 4,645 Down 100 basis points (6,033) 1,388 (4,645) Down 200 basis points (12,024) 2,776 (9,248) Down 300 basis points (17,943) 4,164 (13,779) 
 We may in the future hedge against interest rate fluctuations by using hedging instruments such as additional interest rate swaps, futures, options and forward contracts. While hedging activities may mitigate our exposure to adverse fluctuations in interest rates, certain hedging transactions that we may enter into in the future, such as interest rate swap agreements, may also limit our ability to participate in the benefits of changes in interest rates with respect to our portfolio investments. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 (a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 In accordance with Rules 13a-15(b) and 15d-15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, we, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and determined that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective as of the end of the period covered by the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 (b) Changes in Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting 
 
 There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
