million of accumulated net losses. In addition, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company used in operations and had a working capital deficit of . These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt regarding the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company expects to obtain funding through additional debt and equity placement offerings until it consistently achieves positive cash flows from operations. If the Company is unable to obtain additional funding, it may not be able to meet all of its obligations as they come due for the next twelve months. The continuing viability of the entity and its ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the entity being successful in its continuing efforts in growing its revenue base and/or accessing additional sources of capital, and/or selling assets. 

As a result, there is significant uncertainty whether the entity will continue as a going concern and, therefore, whether it will realize its assets and settle its liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business and at the amounts stated in the financial statements. 

Accordingly, no adjustments have been made to the financial statements relating to the recoverability and classification of the asset carrying amounts or the amount and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the entity not continue as a going concern. At this time, management is of the opinion that no asset is likely to be realized for an amount less than the amount at which it is recorded in the financial statements as at September 30, 2024. 

day right of return to its customers. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 the sales returns allowance was and , respectively. 

Certain larger customers pay in advance for future shipments. These advance payments totaled and at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, and are recorded as customer deposits in the accompanying balance sheets. Revenue related to these advance payments is recognized upon shipment to the distributor or the end-customer. 

At the completion of the initial three -year warranty, the Company sells extended warranties for periods ranging from one to three years. Revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, deferred revenue of and is recorded, respectively, in current and long-term liabilities in the accompanying balance sheets, in connection with these extended warranties. 

Customer B 

Customer C 

Customer E 

Amounts due these customers totaled at both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. There were no amounts due from these customers at both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Customer deposits on hand from these customers totaled and at September 30 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The loss of these customers would have a significant impact on the operations and cash flows of the Company. 

The Company s supplier concentrations expose the Company to business risks, which the Company mitigates by attempting to diversify its supply chain. Significant supplier purchases as a percentage of total inventory purchases are as follows: 

Supplier B 

Supplier D 

Supplier E 

Supplier F 

There were no amounts outstanding due these suppliers at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The loss of key vendors may have a significant impact on the operations and cash flows of the Company. 

The estimated fair value of financial instruments has been determined using available market information and appropriate valuation methodologies. However, considerable judgment is often required to interpret market data used to develop the estimates of fair value. Accordingly, the estimates presented may not be indicative of the amounts the Company could realize in a current market exchange. The use of different market assumptions and/or estimation methodologies could have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts. 

The Company s convertible promissory notes contain variable conversion provisions upon default, Pursuant to ASC 815-15 Embedded Derivatives, the fair values of the variable conversion options and shares to be issued were recorded as derivative liabilities on the default dates.

The lease term for the Company s lease includes the non-cancellable period of the lease plus any additional periods covered by either a Company option to extend (or not to terminate) the lease that the Company is reasonably certain to exercise, or an option to extend (or not to terminate) the lease controlled by the lessor. The Option for the lease renewal has been excluded from the lease term (and lease liability) for the Company s lease as the reasonably certain threshold is not met. 

Lease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability are comprised of fixed payments, variable payments that depend on index or rate, and amounts probable to be payable under the exercise of the Company option to purchase the underlying asset if reasonably certain. 

Variable lease payments not dependent on a rate or index associated with the Company s leases are recognized when the event, activity, or circumstance in the lease agreement on which those payments are assessed as probable. Variable lease payments are presented as operating expenses in the Company s statement of operations in the same line as expense arising from fixed lease payments.

The Company was formed in Nevada on August 30, 2002 as IntelSource Group, Inc. and began operations in 2003. In 2007, IntelSource Group, Inc. merged with ElectroMedical Technologies, LLC. The Company began acting as Electro Medical Technologies, LLC, an Arizona limited liability company on November 9, 2010, after the merger with ElectroMedical Technologies, LLC, a Nevada Company. The Company converted to a corporation in the State of Delaware on August 23, 2017. 

Electromedical Technologies is a bioelectronics manufacturing and marketing company. We offer U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) cleared medical devices for pain management. 

Bioelectronics is a developing field of electronic medicine, which uses electrical impulses over the body s neural circuitry to try to alleviate pain, without drugs. The human body is controlled by electrical signals sent through the nervous system, which can become distorted after accidents or as a result of disease. The field of bioelectronic medicine aims to safely correct irregularities in the nervous system by modifying the electrical language of the body related to pain relief. 

Our mission is to improve global wellness for people suffering from various painful conditions by relieving chronic and acute pain using energy, frequency and vibration as an alternative to pharmaceuticals; and one day, read and modifies electrical signals passing along nerves in the body, to restore long-term health. 

Additionally, we have a corporate goal to offer the public effective alternatives to addictive pain -relieving drugs, such as opioids. According to the Society of Actuaries, opioid overdose deaths are now the single largest factor slowing the growth in U.S. life expectancy and has led to stagnation or decreases in life expectancy three years in a row for the first time since 1915 1918, when the country was facing World War I and the Spanish flu pandemic. The U.S. Centers of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has reported that, from 1999 through 2017, nearly 400,000 have died from overdoses from prescription or illicit opioids. It is our aim to offer effective alternatives to pain management. 

Results of Operations 

Overview and Financial Condition 

Going Concern 

Since inception, the Company has incurred approximately 25.0 million of accumulated net losses. In addition, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company used 49,434 in operations and had a working capital deficit of 3,787,034. These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt regarding the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company expects to obtain funding through additional debt and equity placement offerings until it consistently achieves positive cash flows from operations. If the Company is unable to obtain additional funding, it may not be able to meet all of its obligations as they come due for the next twelve months. The continuing viability of the entity and its ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the entity being successful in its continuing efforts in growing its revenue base and/or accessing additional sources of capital, and/or selling assets. 

18

As a result, there is significant uncertainty whether the entity will continue as a going concern and, therefore, whether it will realize its assets and settle its liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business and at the amounts stated in the financial statements. 

Accordingly, no adjustments have been made to the financial statements relating to the recoverability and classification of the asset carrying amounts or the amount and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the entity not continue as a going concern. At this time, management is of the opinion that no asset is likely to be realized for an amount less than the amount at which it is recorded in the financial statements as at September 30, 2024. 

While priority is on generating cash from operations through the sale of the Company s products, management is also seeking to raise additional working capital through various financing sources, including the sale of the Company s equity and/or debt securities, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. If such financing is not available on satisfactory terms, we may be unable to continue our business as desired and our operating results will be adversely affected. In addition, any financing arrangement may have potentially adverse effects on us and/or our shareholders. Debt financing (if available and undertaken) will increase expenses, must be repaid regardless of operating results and may involve restrictions limiting our operating flexibility. If we issue equity securities to raise additional funds, the percentage ownership of our existing shareholders will be reduced and the new equity securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of the current holders of our shares of Common Stock.

Operating Results 

July 1, 2024 through September 30, 2024 Compared to July 1, 2023 through September 30, 2023 

Our sales totaled 42,526 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 323,613 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of 281,087 or 87 . The decrease is primarily related to a decrease in units sold. Unit sales have decreased as the Company winds down the sale of its current product leading up to the introduction of the new Wellness Pro Infinity. In June 2024, the Company initiated its exchange program, allowing current customers to submit deposits for the new Wellness Pro Infinity. Deposits totaling 764,125 have been collected as of September 30, 2024 for the new product. 

Cost of sales and gross margins for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and for the three months ended September 30, 2023 were 11,881 and 72 and 72,437 and 78 , respectively. Our cost of sales consists of the cost of materials and distribution expenses. Cost of sales and gross margins are affected by product mix as well as the mix in the level of sales between commissioned agents and distributors.

Selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of payroll related expenses, commissions, consulting and professional fees, sales and marketing, research and development and other operating expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses totaled 411,683 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 490,205 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of 78,522 or about 16 . The change is primarily due to decreases in other operating expenses of 59,662, commissions of 31,300, and payroll related expenses of 6,951, partially offset by an increase in consulting and professional fees of 19,866. 

The decrease in other operating expenses consists primarily of approximately 21,000 in rent as a result of the more favorable September 2023 lease, and 27,000 related to insurance. The decrease in commissions reflects the decrease in sales and that sales were to distributors. 

The decrease in payroll related expenses is primarily due to a reduced headcount. 

The increase in consulting and professional fees is primarily related to increased legal fees and public company costs offset by reduced accounting fees. 

Other expense increased by 205,914 primarily due to reduction in accrued penalties of 53,251 for convertible notes payable in default, a decrease in interest expense of 107,207 and an increase in the losses associated with derivative liabilities of 366,642. Accrued penalties were removed in conjunction with the settlement of certain convertible notes payable. The decrease in interest expense is primarily related to the valuation of a trigger warrant in the 2023. period. All debt discount for notes issued prior to Jan 1,2024 has been fully amortized in 2023. 

As a result of the foregoing, we recorded a net loss of 724,643 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to a net loss of 376,720 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in net loss is primarily attributed to the increased loss from operations and the increase in other expense.

The decrease is primarily related to a decrease in units sold as well as a reduction in average selling price. Unit sales have decreased as the Company winds down the sale of its current product leading up to the introduction of the new Wellness Pro Infinity. In June 2024, the Company initiated its exchange program, allowing current customers to submit deposits for the new Wellness Pro Infinity.

Selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of payroll related expenses, commissions, consulting and professional fees, sales and marketing, research and development and other operating expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses totaled 1,209,046 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2,126,326 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of 1,407,485 or about 54 . 

The change is primarily due to a 491,001 decrease in payroll related costs of, which 400,000 is stock-based compensation, a 375,783 decrease in consulting and professional fees, of which 305,000 is stock-based compensation, decreased research and development costs of 289,934, decreased commissions of 81,600 and decreased other operating costs of 147,703. 

Stock-based compensation expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, includes 315,000 related to a consulting agreement with an advisor and director and 400,000 related to the issuance of a share of Series B Preferred stock to the Company s CEO. 

The non -stock based compensation decrease in payroll related costs consists primarily of reduced employee headcount and no CEO bonus earned in the 2024 period. 

The nonstock-based compensation decrease in consulting and professional fees includes, 30,000 related to the resignation of one of the Company s directors as of July 1, 2023, as well as reduced legal, accounting and other public company related expenses. 

The decrease in research and development costs relates to payments made under its product development agreement as new milestones were met in the 2023 period and not in the 2024 period. The decrease in other operating expenses consists primarily of 46,000 in reduced travel, 30,000 related to insurance, 18,000 related to outside services, 10,000 in fees related to convertible note payable conversions and 42,000 related to rent following the 2023 sale of the building. The decrease in commissions reflects the reduction in sales including a larger percentage sold to distributors. 

Other expense increased by 91,303 primarily due to a change in accrued penalties of 726,951 for convertible notes payable in default, and a decrease in interest expense of 662,274, partially offset by and an increase in losses associated with derivative liabilities of 286,852, and by the 1,193,676 gain from the 2023 sale of the building. Accrued penalties were removed in conjunction with the settlement of certain convertible notes payable. The decrease in interest expense is primarily due to 370,000 of additional amortized debt discount and 263,476 related to the valuation of certain trigger warrants for matured convertible notes payable in the 2023 period. All debt discount for notes issued prior to Jan 1,2024 has been fully amortized in 2023. 

As a result of the foregoing, we recorded a net loss of 1,329,681 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to a net loss of 2,292,589 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in net loss is primarily attributed to a decreased loss from operations.

COVID-19 may impact our business. 

On January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern and on March 11, 2020, declared it to be a pandemic. Actions taken around the world to help mitigate the spread of the COVID-19 include restrictions on travel, and quarantines in certain areas, and forced closures for certain types of public places and businesses. COVID-19, and actions taken to mitigate it, have had and are expected to continue to have an adverse impact on the economies and financial markets of many countries, including the geographical areas in which we operate. While it is unknown how long these conditions will last and what the complete financial effect will be to the Company, COVID-19 may have an adverse effect on our business. While we are taking diligent steps to mitigate any possible disruptions to our business, we are unable to predict the extent or nature of these impacts, at this time, to our future financial condition and results of operations. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

During the nine months ended September 30,2024 our cash and cash equivalents decreased by 52,895 reflecting cash used in operations of 80,263 and provided by financing activities of 27,638.

The cash flows provided in the 2024 period relate to the net proceeds from a convertible debt financing. The cash flows used in the 2023 period are primarily the result of the 522,401 repayment of the long- term bank debt related to the building as part of the March 2023 sale and convertible notes payable payments totaling 85,985. 

In March and April 2024, the Company entered into settlement agreements with two of its lenders for amounts in default under the October 2021, February 2022, March 2022 and September 2022 convertible promissory notes. The settlement agreements have been accounted for as debt modifications. (See Note 6).

Certain outstanding warrants are to be cancelled without consideration. 

The maturity date has been extended to September 25, 2025. 

Interest rate is capped at 12 per annum. 

Default penalties accrued up to the settlement date are no longer due and from the effective date forward are amended to 115 from 125 . Default penalties totaling approximately 3,000 and 337,000 have been reversed and recorded as other income in the Company s statement of operations for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. 

22

All payments will be applied first to outstanding principal and will include the note holders pro-rata share of 400 - 600 per unit, from futures sales of the Company s Wellness ProPlus Infinity units. 

Conversions of outstanding principal are limited to 30,000 per calendar month through December 31, 2024, and may be waived under certain conditions and after such date.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 

As a smaller reporting company as defined by Item 10 of Regulation S-K, the Company is not required to provide information required by this Item. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in its Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow for timely and reliable financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 

As of the period ended September 30, 2024 our principal executive officer and principal financial officer completed an assessment of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, to determine the existence of any material weaknesses or significant deficiencies. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. A significant deficiency is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting that is less severe than a material weakness, yet important enough to merit attention by those responsible for oversight of the registrant s financial reporting. 

Based on this evaluation, the Company s management concluded its internal controls over financial reporting were not effective as of September 30, 2024. The ineffectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting was due to the following identified material weaknesses and significant deficiencies: 

Material Weakness 

Management identified the following material weaknesses: 

we do not have an Audit Committee While not being legally obligated to have an Audit Committee, it is the management s view that such a committee, including a financial expert board member, is an utmost important entity level control of the Company s financial statements. Currently the Board of Directors acts in the capacity of the Audit Committee and does not include a member that is considered to be independent of management to provide the necessary oversight over management s activities. 

we have not performed a risk assessment and mapped our processes to control objectives. 

we have not implemented comprehensive entity-level internal controls. 

23

we have not implemented adequate system and manual controls; and 

we do not have sufficient segregation of duties. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting. 

Our management will continue to monitor and evaluate the designation, implementation and effectiveness of our internal controls and procedures and our internal controls over financial reporting on an ongoing basis and is committed to taking further action and implementing additional enhancements or improvements, as necessary. There were no changes in such controls during the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 

There are presently no material pending legal proceedings filed to which the Company, any executive officer, or any owner of record or beneficially of more than five percent of any class of voting securities is a party or as to which any of its property is subject. 

There are unasserted claims between the Company and one of the Company s lenders that could possibly exceed 5,000. As of the date of this filing, the lender notified the Company that, because of the respective defaults or cross defaults of matured notes resulting from the sale of its real property, the default amounts under the note, including the payment of principal, accrued interest, default interest, and legal fees, multiplied by 150 is being sought. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the note holder has applied default conversion rates to outstanding principal, interest, and default amounts under the notes. The Company has accrued all default interest under the note. The Company is in negotiations with the lender to reform the note in default. With respect to the unasserted claims by and between the Company and the noteholder, the ongoing negotiations of the parties are informal, private, confidential, and, as of the date of this filing, are incomplete and unresolved. Thus, it is difficult as of the date of this filing to establish whether or not any legal actions arising from these unasserted claims are probable, reasonably possible, or remote, or what remedies may be sought in any action, and whether or not those remedies are material under FAS 5. No note holder has communicated to the Company that legal action exists or is imminent. No court has jurisdiction over the matters because, as of the date of this filing, no lender has filed an action in any court of competent jurisdiction or any arbitration proceeding. 

Based on the information presently available, including discussion with outside counsel and other consultants, management believes, as of the date of this filing, that resolution of any other matters will not have a material adverse effect on its business, results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows. 

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 

As a smaller reporting company as defined by Item 10 of Regulation S-K, the Company is not required to provide information required by this Item. 

ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS
