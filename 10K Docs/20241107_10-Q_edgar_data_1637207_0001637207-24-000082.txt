 How we assess the performance of our business 
 In assessing the performance of our business, we consider a variety of performance and financial measures. The key measures for determining how our business is performing include total monthly dues and annual fees billed to members (which we refer to as system-wide sales), the number of new club openings, same club sales (historically referred to as same store sales) for both corporate-owned and franchisee-owned clubs, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Segment EBITDA, Adjusted net income and Adjusted net income per share, diluted. See Non-GAAP financial measures below for our definition of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted net income, and Adjusted net income per share, diluted and why we present EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted net income, and Adjusted net income per share, diluted, and for a reconciliation of our EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted net income to net income, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, and a reconciliation of Adjusted net income per share, diluted to net income per share, diluted, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. 
 Number of new club openings 
 The number of new club openings reflects clubs opened during a particular reporting period for both corporate-owned and franchisee-owned clubs. Opening new clubs is an important part of our growth strategy and we expect the majority of our future new clubs will be franchisee-owned. Before we obtain the certificate of occupancy or report any revenue for new corporate-owned clubs, we incur pre-opening costs, such as rent expense, labor expense, marketing expense and other operating expenses. Our clubs open with an initial start-up period of higher than normal marketing and operating expenses, particularly as a percentage of monthly revenue. New clubs may not be profitable and their revenue may not follow historical patterns. The following table shows the growth in our corporate-owned and franchisee-owned club base:

 (1) The term debranded refers to a franchisee-owned club whose right to use the Planet Fitness brand and marks has been terminated in accordance with the franchise agreement. We retain the right to prevent debranded clubs from continuing to operate as fitness clubs. The term consolidated refers to the combination of a franchisee s club with another club located in close proximity with our prior approval. This often coincides with an enlargement, re-equipment and/or refurbishment of the remaining club. 
 Same club sales 
 Same club sales refers to year-over-year sales comparisons for the same club sales base of both corporate-owned and franchisee-owned clubs. We define the same club sales base to include those clubs that have been open and for which monthly membership dues have been billed for longer than 12 months. We measure same club sales based solely upon monthly dues billed to members of our corporate-owned and franchisee-owned clubs. 
 Several factors affect our same club sales in any given period, including the following: 
 the number of clubs that have been in operation for more than 12 months; 
 the percentage mix and pricing of PF Black Card and standard Classic Card memberships in any period; 
 growth in total net memberships per club; 
 consumer recognition of our brand and our ability to respond to changing consumer preferences; 
 overall economic trends, particularly those related to consumer spending; 
 our ability and our franchisees ability to operate clubs effectively and efficiently to meet consumer expectations; 
 marketing and promotional efforts; 
 local competition; 
 trade area dynamics; and 
 opening of new clubs in the vicinity of existing locations. 
 We present same club sales as compared to the same period in the prior year for all clubs that have been open and for which monthly membership dues have been billed for longer than 12 months, beginning with the 13 th month and thereafter, as applicable. Same club sales of our international clubs are calculated on a constant currency basis, meaning that we translate the current year s same club sales of our international clubs at the same exchange rates used in the prior year. Since opening new clubs is a significant component of our revenue growth, same club sales is only one measure of how we evaluate our performance.

 Clubs acquired from or sold to franchisees are removed from the franchisee-owned or corporate-owned same club sales base, as applicable, upon the ownership change and for the 12 months following the date of the ownership change. These clubs are included in the corporate-owned or franchisee-owned same club sales base, as applicable, following the 12 th month after the acquisition or sale. These clubs remain in the system-wide same club sales base in all periods. The following table shows our same club sales:

 2,634 2,350 2,634 2,351 
 Total monthly dues and annual fees from members (system-wide sales) 
 We review the total amount of dues we collect from our members on a monthly basis, which allows us to assess changes in the performance of our corporate-owned and franchisee-owned clubs from period to period, any competitive pressures, local or regional membership traffic patterns and general market conditions that might impact our club performance. System-wide sales is an operating measure that includes monthly membership dues and annual fee billings by franchisees that are not revenue realized by the Company in accordance with GAAP, as well as monthly membership dues and annual fee billings by our corporate-owned clubs. While we do not record sales by franchisees as revenue, and such sales are not included in our condensed consolidated financial statements, we believe that this operating measure aids in understanding how we derive royalty revenue and is important in evaluating our performance. We bill monthly dues on or around the 17 th of every month and bill annual fees once per year to each member based upon when the member signed their membership agreement. System-wide sales were 1.2 billion and 1.1 billion during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 3.6 billion and 3.3 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 
 Non-GAAP financial measures 
 We refer to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as we use these measures to evaluate our operating performance and we believe these measures are useful to investors in evaluating our performance. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as presented in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are supplemental measures of our performance that are neither required by, nor presented in accordance with GAAP. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as substitutes for GAAP metrics such as net income or any other performance measures derived in accordance with GAAP. 
 Also, in the future we may incur expenses or charges such as those used to calculate Adjusted EBITDA. Our presentation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or nonrecurring items. We have also disclosed Segment EBITDA as an important financial metric utilized by the Company to evaluate performance and allocate resources to segments in accordance with ASC 280, Segment Reporting . As part of such disclosure in Our Segments within Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, the Company has provided a reconciliation from income from operations to Total Segment EBITDA, which is equal to the Non-GAAP financial metric EBITDA. 
 We define EBITDA as net income before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. We believe that EBITDA, which eliminates the impact of certain expenses that we do not believe reflect our underlying business performance, provides useful information to investors to assess the performance of our segments as well as the business as a whole. Our Board of Directors also uses EBITDA as a key metric to assess the performance of management. We define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA, adjusted for the impact of certain additional non-cash and other items that we do not consider in our evaluation of ongoing performance of the Company s core operations. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA is an appropriate measure of operating performance in addition to EBITDA because it eliminates the impact of other items that we believe reduce the comparability of our underlying core business performance from period to period and is therefore useful to our investors.

 (1) Represents the impact of revenue-related purchase accounting adjustments associated with the acquisition of Pla-Fit Holdings on November 8, 2012 by TSG (the 2012 Acquisition ). At the time of the 2012 Acquisition, the Company maintained a deferred revenue account, which consisted of deferred area development agreement fees, deferred franchise fees, and deferred enrollment fees that the Company billed and collected up front but recognizes for GAAP purposes at a later date. In connection with the 2012 Acquisition, it was determined that the carrying amount of deferred revenue was greater than the fair value assessed in accordance with ASC 805 Business Combinations, which resulted in a write-down of the carrying value of the deferred revenue balance upon application of acquisition push-down accounting under ASC 805. These amounts represent the additional revenue that would have been recognized if the write-down to deferred revenue had not occurred in connection with the application of acquisition pushdown accounting. 
 (2) Represents the impact of rent related purchase accounting adjustments. In accordance with guidance in ASC 805 Business Combinations, in connection with the 2012 Acquisition, the Company s deferred rent liability was required to be written off as of the acquisition date and rent was recorded on a straight-line basis from the acquisition date through the end of the lease term. This resulted in higher overall rent expense each period than would have otherwise been recorded had the deferred rent liability not been written off as a result of the acquisition push down accounting applied in accordance with ASC 805. The rent related purchase accounting adjustments are adjustments to rent expense recorded in club operations on our condensed consolidated statements of operations, which reflect the difference between the higher rent expense recorded in accordance with GAAP since the acquisition and the rent expense that would have been recorded had the 2012 Acquisition not occurred, as well as the amortization of favorable and unfavorable lease intangible assets. 
 (3) Represents the impact of a non-cash loss recorded in accordance with ASC 805 Business Combinations related to our acquisition of franchisee-owned clubs. The loss recorded under U.S. GAAP represents the difference between the fair value and the contractual terms of the reacquired franchise rights and is included in other (gains) losses, net on our condensed consolidated statement of operations. 
 (4) Represents transaction fees and acquisition-related costs incurred in connection with our acquisition of franchisee-owned clubs. 
 (5) Represents severance related expenses recorded in connection with a reduction in force during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and the elimination of the President and Chief Operating Officer position during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 (6) Represents certain expenses recorded in connection with the departure of the former Chief Executive Officer, including costs associated with the search for and stock based compensation associated with certain equity awards granted to the Company s new Chief Executive Officer and retention payments for certain key employees through the Chief Executive Officer transition. 
 (7) Represents costs associated with legal matters in which the Company was a defendant. In 2023, this represents an increase in the legal reserve related to preliminary terms of a settlement agreement (the Preliminary Settlement Agreement ). The legal reserve liability was subsequently paid in 2023. 
 (8) Represents a loss (gain) on the adjustment of the allowance for credit losses on the Company s held-to-maturity investment. 
 (9) Represents dividend income recognized on the Company s held-to-maturity investment. 
 (10) Represents a loss (gain) related to the adjustment of our tax benefit arrangements primarily due to changes in our deferred state tax rate.

 (11) Represents the Company s pro-rata portion of the basis difference related to intangible asset amortization expense in its equity method investees, which is included within losses from equity-method investments, net of tax on our condensed consolidated statements of operations.

 Adjusted net income assumes that all net income is attributable to Planet Fitness, Inc., which assumes the full exchange of all outstanding Holdings Units for shares of Class A common stock of Planet Fitness, Inc., adjusted for certain non-cash and other items that we do not believe directly reflect our core operations. Adjusted net income per share, diluted, is calculated by dividing Adjusted net income by the total weighted-average shares of Class A common stock outstanding plus any dilutive awards granted under the 2015 Omnibus Incentive Plan as calculated in accordance with GAAP and assuming the full exchange of all outstanding Holdings Units and corresponding Class B common stock as of the beginning of each period presented. Adjusted net income and Adjusted net income per share, diluted, are supplemental measures of operating performance that do not represent, and should not be considered, alternatives to net income and earnings per share, as calculated in accordance with GAAP. We believe Adjusted net income and Adjusted net income per share, diluted, supplement GAAP measures and enable us to more effectively evaluate our performance period-over-period. A reconciliation of net income, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, to Adjusted net income, and the computation of Adjusted net income per share, diluted, is set forth below.

 We require cash principally to fund day-to-day operations, to finance capital investments, to service our outstanding debt and tax benefit arrangements and to address our working capital needs. Based on our current level of operations, we believe that with our available cash balance, the cash generated from our operations, and amounts available under our 2022 Variable Funding Notes will be adequate to meet our anticipated debt service requirements and obligations under our tax benefit arrangements, capital expenditures and working capital needs for at least the next 12 months. Our ability to continue to fund these items could be adversely affected by the occurrence of any of the events described under Risk Factors in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. There can be no assurance that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operations or otherwise to enable us to service our indebtedness, including our Securitized Senior Notes, or to make anticipated capital expenditures. Our future operating performance and our ability to service, extend or refinance our indebtedness will be subject to future economic conditions and to financial, business and other factors, many of which are beyond our control.

The net proceeds from the sale of the Series 2024-1 Class A-2 Notes were used to repay in full the Master Issuer s outstanding Series 2018-1 Class A-2-II Notes, including the payment of transaction costs. The remaining funds were used, together with cash on hand, to fund a 280 million accelerated share repurchase agreement.

 In February 2022, the Master Issuer issued the Series 2022-1 Class A-1 Notes, which allow for the drawing of up to 75 million of 2022 Variable Funding Notes, including a letter of credit facility. The 2022 Variable Funding Notes are undrawn as of September 30, 2024.

 Off-balance sheet arrangements 
 As of September 30, 2024, our off-balance sheet arrangements consisted of guarantees of lease agreements for certain franchisees up to a maximum period of ten years with earlier expiration dates possible if certain conditions are met. Our maximum total obligation under these lease guarantee agreements is approximately 4.7 million and would require payment only upon default by the primary obligor. The estimated fair value of these guarantees as of September 30, 2024 was not material, and no accrual has been recorded for our potential obligation under these arrangements. 
 Critical accounting policies and use of estimates

 ITEM 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 
 Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 There are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system of disclosure controls and procedures, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of the controls and procedures. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives. 
 Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that as of September 30, 2024 , our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports it files or submits with the Securities and Exchange Commission is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms and is accumulated and communicated to our management, including the principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 Changes in internal control over financial reporting 
 There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during our most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 
 PART II-OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM 1. Legal Proceedings 
 We are currently involved in various claims and legal actions that arise in the ordinary course of business, most of which are covered by insurance. We do not believe that the ultimate resolution of these actions will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or capital resources nor do we believe that there is a reasonable possibility that we will incur material loss as a result of such actions. However, a significant increase in the number of these claims or an increase in amounts owing under successful claims could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
