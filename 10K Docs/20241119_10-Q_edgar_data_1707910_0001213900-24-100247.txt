Going Concern
Matters 

The accompanying consolidated
financial statements have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America GAAP ),
which contemplates the Company s continuation as a going concern. The Company incurred a net comprehensive loss of during
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and has an accumulated deficit of as of September 30, 2024. In addition, current
liabilities exceed current assets by as of September 30, 2024. 

Management intends
to raise additional operating funds through equity and/or debt offerings. However, there can be no assurance management will be successful
in its endeavors. 

There are no assurances
that the Company will be able to either (1) achieve a level of revenues adequate to generate sufficient cash flow from operations; or
(2) obtain additional financing through either private placement, public offerings, and/or bank financing necessary to support its working
capital requirements. To the extent that funds generated from operations and any private placements, public offerings, and/or bank financing
are insufficient, the Company will have to raise additional working capital. No assurance can be given that additional financing will
be available, or if available, will be on terms acceptable to the Company. If adequate working capital is not available to the Company,
it may be required to curtail or cease its operations. 

Due to uncertainties
related to these matters, there exists substantial doubt about the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern. The accompanying
consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability or classification of asset-carrying amounts
or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.

The Paycheck Protection
Program Loan (the PPP Loan is administered by the U.S. Small Business Administration (the SBA ). The interest
rate of the loan is per annum and accrues on the unpaid principal balance computed on the basis of the actual number of days
elapsed in a year of 360 days. Commencing seven months after the effective date of the PPP Loan, the Company is required to pay the Lender
equal monthly payments of principal and interest as required to fully amortize any unforgiven principal balance of the loan by the two-year
anniversary of the effective date of the PPP Loan (the Maturity Date ). The PPP Loan contains customary events of default
relating to, among other things, payment defaults, making materially false or misleading representations to the SBA or the Lender, or
breaching the terms of the PPP Loan. The occurrence of an event of default may result in the repayment of all amounts outstanding under
the PPP Loan, collection of all amounts owing from the Company, or filing suit and obtaining judgment against the Company. Under the terms
of the CARES Act, PPP loan recipients can apply for and be granted forgiveness for all or a portion of the loan granted under the PPP.
Such forgiveness will be determined, subject to limitations, based on the use of loan proceeds for payment of payroll costs and any payments
of mortgage interest, rent, and utilities. Recent modifications to the PPP by the U.S. Treasury and Congress have extended the time period
for loan forgiveness beyond the original eight-week period, making it possible for the Company to apply for forgiveness of its PPP loan.

Preferred Stock 

The Company has authorization
to issue and have outstanding at any one time shares of preferred stock with a par value of per share,
in one or more classes or series within a class as may be determined by our board of directors, who establish, from time to time, the
number of shares to be included in each class or series, fix the designation, powers, preferences and rights of the shares of each such
class or series and any qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof. Any preferred stock so issued is senior to other existing
classes of common stock with respect to the payment of dividends or amounts upon liquidation or dissolution. As of September 30, 2024
and December 31, 2022, no shares of our preferred stock had been designated any rights and we had no shares of preferred stock

Issuance of Common
Stock in Settlement of Antidilution Provisions 

In May 2018, the Company
had entered into a share exchange agreement wherein Capax, Inc., the predecessor entity of Reborn Coffee, Inc. Capax effectively
merged with Reborn Global Holdings, Inc. to form the Company. In this share exchange agreement, the preexisting shareholders of Capax
were provided covenants that for a period of one year following the date upon which the Company is approved for quotation or trading on
a public exchange, the percentage of ownership of the prior shareholders of Capax would not be less than the of the total number
of shares of voting common stock outstanding of the Company that they owned following the share exchange. In the event the ownership of
the pre-merger shareholders of Capax fell below , the Company was obligated to issue that number of shares of common stock to those
shareholders which would increase the ownership of all of the Pre-Merger Shareholders to five percent of the total outstanding voting
common shares of the Company. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company issued shares of common stock under
these provisions. 

On January 25, 2022,
the Company modified this agreement with the preexisting shareholders to effectively end the antidilution protection at the time of a
successful public offering, eliminating the one-year period following an the public offering as provided under the original agreement.
The shareholders would be entitled to additional protection through the IPO date should the Company issue any additional shares between
December 31, 2021 and the IPO date. The Company has not issued any additional shares subsequent to December 31, 2021 and the shareholders
do not have such antidilution protection rights since the Company s IPO date. 

Dividend policy 

Dividends are paid
at the discretion of the Board of Directors. There were no dividends declared for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 

You should read the following discussion and
analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our condensed consolidated financial statements and the related
notes and other financial information included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and with our audited consolidated financial
statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the year ending December 31, 2023. As discussed in the section titled Note
Regarding Forward-Looking Statements, the following discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks
and uncertainties, as well as assumptions that, if they never materialize or prove incorrect, could cause our results to differ materially
from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include,
but are not limited to, those identified below and those discussed in the section titled Risk Factors in our Annual Report
on Form 10-K/A for the year ending December 31, 2023. 

Business 

Reborn is focused on serving high quality,
specialty-roasted coffee at retail locations, kiosks and cafes. We are an innovative company that strives for constant improvement in
the coffee experience through exploration of new technology and premier service, guided by traditional brewing techniques. We believe
Reborn differentiates itself from other coffee roasters through its innovative techniques, including sourcing, washing, roasting, and
brewing our coffee beans with a balance of precision and craft. 

Founded in 2015 by Jay Kim, our Chief Executive
Officer, Mr. Kim and his team launched Reborn with the vision of using the finest pure ingredients and pristine water. We currently serve
customers through our retail store locations in California: Brea, La Crescenta, Corona Del Mar, Laguna Woods, Manhattan Beach, Huntington
Beach, Riverside, San Francisco, Irvine, Diamond Bar and Anaheim. 

Reborn continues to elevate the high-end coffee
experience and we received first place traditional still in America s Best Cold Brew competition by Coffee Fest in
2017 in Portland and 2018 in Los Angeles. 

The Experience, Reborn 

We believe that we are the leading pioneers
of the emerging Fourth Wave movement and that our business is redefining specialty coffee as an experience that demands
much more than premium quality. We consider ourselves leaders of the fourth wave coffee movement because we are constantly
developing our bean processing methods, researching design concepts, and reinventing new ways of drinking coffee. For instance, the current
transition from the K-Cup trend to the pour over drip concept allowed us to reinvent the way people consume coffee, by merging convenience
and quality. We took the pour over drip concept and made it available and affordable to the public through our Reborn Coffee Pour Over
packs. Our Pour Over Packs allow our consumers to consume our specialty coffee outdoors and on-the-go. 

Our success in innovating within the Fourth
Wave coffee movement is measured by our success in B2B sales with our introduction of Reborn Coffee Pour Over Packs to hotels.
With the introduction of our Pour Over Packs to major hotels (including one hotel company with 7 locations), our B2B sales increased as
these companies recognized the convenience and functionality our Pour Over Packs serve to their customers. 

Our continuous Research and Development is
essential to developing new parameters in the production of new blends. Our first place position in America s Best Cold Brew 
competition by Coffee Fest in 2017 in Portland and 2018 in Los Angeles is a testament to the way we believe we lead the Fourth
Wave movement by example. 

Centered around its core values of service,
trust, and well-being, Reborn Coffee delivers an appreciation of coffee as both a science and an art. Developing innovative processes
such as washing green coffee beans with magnetized water, we challenge traditional preparation methods by focusing on the relationship
between water chemistry, health, and flavor profile. Reborn Coffee proactively distinguishes exceptional quality from good quality by
starting at the foundation and paying attention to the details. Our mission places an equal emphasis on humanizing the coffee experience,
delivering a fresh take on farm-to-table by sourcing internationally. In this way, Reborn Coffee creates opportunities to
develop transparency by paying homage to origin stories and sparking new conversations by building cross-cultural communities united by
a passion for the finest coffee. 

21 

Through a broad product offering, Reborn Coffee
provides customers with a wide variety of beverages and coffee options. As a result, we believe we can capture share of any experience
where customers seek to consume great beverages whether in our inviting store atmospheres which are designed for comfort, or on the go
through our Pour Over Packs, or at home with our whole bean ground coffee bags. We believe that the retail coffee market in the US is
large and growing. According to IBIS, in 2021, the retail market for coffee in the United States is expected to be 46.2 billion. This
is expected to grow due to a shift in consumer preferences to premium coffee, including specialized blends, espresso-based beverages,
and cold brew options. Reborn aims to capture a growing portion of the market as we expand and increase consumer awareness of our brand. 

Plan of Operation 

We have a production and distribution center
at our headquarters that we use to process and roast coffee for wholesale and retail distribution. 

Currently, we have the
following twelve retail coffee locations: 

La Floresta Shopping Village in Brea, California; 

La Crescenta, California; 

Corona Del Mar, California; 

Home Depot Center in Laguna Woods, California; 

Manhattan Village at Manhattan Beach, California. 

Huntington Beach, California; 

Galleria at Tyler in Riverside, California; 

Intersect in Irvine, California; 

Diamond Bar, California; 

Anaheim, California;

Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Significant
Judgments and Estimates 

Revenue 

The Company recognizes revenue in accordance
with ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. The Company s net revenue primarily consists of revenues from its retail locations
and wholesale and online store. Accordingly, the Company recognizes revenue as follows: 

Retail Store Revenue 

Retail store revenues are recognized
when payment is tendered at the point of sale. Retail store revenues are reported net of sales, use or other transaction taxes that are
collected from customers and remitted to taxing authorities. Sales taxes that are payable are recorded as accrued as other current liabilities.
Retail store revenue makes up approximately 92 of the Company s total revenue. 

Wholesale and Online Revenue 

Wholesale and online revenues are
recognized when the products are delivered, and title passes to the customers or to the wholesale distributors. When customers pick up
products at the Company s warehouse, or distributed to the wholesale distributors, the title passes, and revenue is recognized. 

Wholesale revenues make up approximately
8 of the Company s total revenue. 

22 

Royalties and Other Fees 

Franchise revenues consist of royalty
fees and other franchise fees. Royalty fees are based on a percentage of a franchisee s weekly gross sales revenue at 5 . The Company
recognizes the fee as the underlying sales occur. The Company did not have any revenue from royalties or other fees for the nine months
ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 

Long-lived Assets 

In accordance with FASB ASC Topic 360, Property,
Plant, and Equipment, the Company reviews for impairment of long-lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles whenever events or
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of assets may not be recoverable. The Company considers the carrying value of assets may
not be recoverable based upon our review of the following events or changes in circumstances: the asset s ability to continue to
generate income from operations and positive cash flow in future periods; loss of legal ownership or title to the assets; significant
changes in our strategic business objectives and utilization of the asset; or significant negative industry or economic trends. An impairment
loss would be recognized when estimated future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset are less than its carrying amount.
As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company was not aware of any events or changes in circumstances that would indicate
that the long-lived assets are impaired. 

Cost of Sales 

Cost of sales includes costs associated with
generating revenue within our company-owned retail locations, and franchising operations (of which, as of September 30, 2024, we had none). 

Shipping and Handling Costs 

The Company incurred freight out cost and
is included in the Company s cost of sale. 

General and Administrative Expense 

General and administrative expense includes
store-related expense as well as the Company s corporate headquarters expenses. 

Advertising Expense 

Advertising costs are expensed as incurred.
Advertising expenses amounted to 110,050 and 49,531 for the nine months ended September
30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and are recorded under general and administrative expenses in the accompanying condensed consolidated
statements of operations. 

Pre-opening Costs 

Pre-opening costs for new stores, which are
not material, consist primarily of payroll and recruiting expense, training, marketing, rent, travel, and supplies, and are expensed as
incurred depreciated over the shorter of the useful life of the improvement or the lease term, including renewal periods that are reasonably
assured.

Revenues 

Revenues were approximately 4.14 million for
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 4.15 million for the comparable period
in 2023, representing a decrease of approximately 5,611, or 0.1 . Revenues were approximately 1.3 million for the three months ended
September 30, 2024, compared to 1.5 million for the comparable period in 2023, representing a decrease of approximately 255,000, or
16.9 . 

Product, food and drink costs 

Product, food and drink costs were approximately
 1.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 1.3 million for the
comparable period in 2023, representing a decrease of approximately 253,000 or 19.1 , and were approximately 441,000 for the three months
ended September 30, 2024 compared to 442,000 for the comparable period in the prior year. 

General and administrative expenses 

General and administrative expenses were approximately
 5.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 5.7 million for the
comparable period in the prior year, representing an increase of approximately 157,000, or 2.8 , and were approximately 1.5 million
for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 1.8 million for the comparable period in 2023, representing a decrease of approximately
 257,000, or 14.3 . 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

We have a history of operating losses and
negative cash flow in operating activities. We have incurred recurring net losses, including net losses from operations before income
taxes of 3.0 million and 3.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023,
respectively. We used 3.3 million and 3.0 million of cash for operating activities for the nine
months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 

Our cash needs will depend on numerous factors,
including our revenues, completion of our product development activities, customer and market acceptance of our product, and our ability
to reduce and control costs. We expect to devote substantial capital resources to, among other things, fund operations and continue development
plans. 

To support our existing and planned business
model, the Company needs to raise additional capital to fund our future operations. The Company has not experienced any difficulty in
raising funds through loans, and has not experienced any liquidity problems in settling payables in the normal course of business and
repaying loans when they fall due. Successful renewal of our loans, however, is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties. In addition,
the increasingly competitive industry conditions under which we operate may negatively impact our results of operations and cash flows.
Additional debt financing is anticipated to fund the Company s operations in the near future. However, there are no current agreements
or understandings with regard to the form, time or amount of such financing and there is no assurance that any of this financing can be
obtained or that the Company can continue as a going concern.

Credit Facilities 

Economic
Injury Disaster Loan 

On May 16, 2020, we executed the EIDL Loan
from the SBA under its EIDL assistance program in light of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business. As of September 30, 2024,
the loan payable, EIDL Loan noted above is not in default. 

Pursuant to the SBA Loan Agreement, we borrowed
an aggregate principal amount of the EIDL Loan of 500,000, with proceeds to be used for working capital purposes. Interest accrues at
the rate of 3.75 per annum and will accrue only on funds actually advanced from the date of each advance. Installment payments, including
principal and interest, are due monthly beginning May 16, 2021 (twelve months from the date of the SBA Loan Agreement) in the amount of
 731. The balance of principal and interest is payable thirty years from the date of the SBA Loan Agreement. In connection therewith,
we also received a 10,000 grant, which does not have to be repaid. During the year ended December 31, 2020, 10,000 was recorded in Economy
injury disaster loan (EIDL) grant income in the Statements of Operations. The schedule of payments on this loan was later deferred to
commence 24 months from the date of loan and we has paid all payments owed since May 2022. 

In connection therewith, we executed (i) a
loan for the benefit of the SBA, which contains customary events of default and (ii) a Security Agreement, granting the SBA a security
interest in all of our tangible and intangible personal property, which also contains customary events of default (the SBA Security
Agreement ). 

26 

Paycheck
Protection Program Loan 

In May 2020, we secured a loan under the PPP
administered by the SBA in the amount of 115,000. In February 2021, we secured a second loan under this program in the amount of approximately
 167,000. The interest rate of the loan is 1.00 per annum and accrues on the unpaid principal balance computed on the basis of the actual
number of days elapsed in a year of 360 days. Commencing seven months after the effective date of each PPP Loan, we are required to pay
the Lender equal monthly payments of principal and interest as required to fully amortize any unforgiven principal balance of the loan
by the two-year anniversary of the effective date of the loan. The PPP Loan contains customary events of default relating to, among other
things, payment defaults, making materially false or misleading representations to the SBA or the Lender, or breaching the terms of the
PPP Loan. The occurrence of an event of default may result in the repayment of all amounts outstanding under the PPP Loan, collection
of all amounts owing, or filing suit and obtaining judgment against us. Under the terms of the CARES Act, PPP loan recipients can apply
for and be granted forgiveness for all or a portion of the loan granted under the PPP. Such forgiveness will be determined, subject to
limitations, based on the use of loan proceeds for payment of payroll costs and any payments of mortgage interest, rent, and utilities.
Recent modifications to the PPP by the U.S. Treasury and Congress have extended the time period for loan forgiveness beyond the original
eight-week period, making it possible for the Company to apply for forgiveness of its PPP loan. We were granted forgiveness for the initial
PPP Loan prior to December 31, 2021 and expects to be granted forgiveness on the remainder subsequently. 

Leases 

Operating
Leases 

We currently lease all company-owned retail
locations. Operating leases typically contain escalating rentals over the lease term, as well as optional renewal periods. Rent expense
for operating leases is recorded on a straight-line basis over the lease term and begins when Reborn has the right to use the property.
The difference between rent expense and cash payment is recorded as deferred rent on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Pre-opening
rent is included in selling, general and administrative expenses on the accompanying consolidated statements of income. Tenant incentives
used to fund leasehold improvements are recorded in deferred rent and amortized as reductions to rent expense over the term of the lease. 

Income Taxes 

Reborn files income tax returns in the U.S.
federal and California state jurisdictions. 

We are taxed at the prevailing corporate tax
rates for U.S. federal, state and local income taxes. Accordingly, a provision is recorded for the anticipated tax consequences of our
reported results of operations for U.S. federal, state and foreign income taxes. 

Off Balance Sheet Arrangements 

We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements
that we are required to disclose pursuant to these regulations. In the ordinary course of business, we enter into operating lease commitments,
purchase commitments and other contractual obligations. These transactions are recognized in our financial statements in accordance with
GAAP. 

Critical Accounting Estimates and Policies 

The preparation of financial statements requires
management to utilize estimates and make judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and
related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. These estimates are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions
that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. The estimates are evaluated by management on an ongoing basis, and
the results of these evaluations form a basis for making decisions about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily
apparent from other sources. Although actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions, management
believes that the estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements are reasonable. The critical accounting policies affecting
our financial reporting are summarized in Note 2 to the financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements 

We have determined that all other issued,
but not yet effective accounting pronouncements are inapplicable or insignificant to us and once adopted are not expected to have a material
impact on our financial position.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures
About Market Risk. 

We are a smaller reporting company as defined
by 17 C.F.R. 229 (10)(f)(1)(i) and are not required to provide information under this item. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Our management has evaluated the effectiveness
of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended
(the Exchange Act )), as of September 30, 2024. Based on such evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer have concluded that as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were ineffective to provide reasonable assurance
that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act (a) is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the time periods specified by Securities and Exchange Commission SEC rules and forms and
(b) is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate,
to allow timely decisions regarding any required disclosure. 

Management has identified control deficiencies
regarding inadequate accounting resources, the lack of segregation of duties and the need for a stronger internal control environment.
Our management believes that these material weaknesses are due to the small size of our accounting staff. The small size of our accounting
outsourced staff may prevent adequate controls in the future due to the cost/benefit of such remediation. 

To mitigate the current limited resources
and limited employees, we rely heavily on direct management oversight of transactions, along with the use of external legal and accounting
professionals. As we grow, we expect to increase our number of employees, which will enable us to implement adequate segregation of duties
within the internal control framework. 

These control deficiencies could result in
a misstatement of account balances that would result in a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement to our financial statements
may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. In light of this material weakness, we performed additional analyses and procedures
in order to conclude that our financial statements for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, included in this Quarterly Report on Form
10-Q were fairly stated in accordance with GAAP. Accordingly, management believes that despite our material weaknesses, our financial
statements for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, are fairly stated, in all material respects, in accordance with GAAP. 

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting 

There were no changes in our internal control
over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially
affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
