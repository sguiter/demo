 which was not adjusted for an acquisition control premium. The acquisition control premium would further increase the percentage by which the estimated fair value of the Company s single reporting unit would exceed the carrying value. 
 The estimated fair value of the Company s single reporting unit is sensitive to the volatility in the Company s stock price. For example, a 5 decrease in the Company s September 30, 2024 stock price would result in its market capitalization exceeding the carrying value of its single reporting unit by , which is not adjusted for an acquisition control premium. If the Company's market capitalization continues to decline or future performance falls below the Company s current expectations, assumptions, or estimates, including assumptions related to current macroeconomic uncertainties, this may trigger a future material non-cash goodwill impairment charge, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company s business, financial condition, and results of operations in the reporting period in which a charge would be necessary. The Company will continue to monitor developments, including updates to the Company s forecasts and market capitalization. An update of the Company s assessment and related estimates may be required in the future. 
 million in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and an accumulated deficit of million. Based on the Company s current cash balance, its cost reductions implemented to date, and working capital adjustments, the Company anticipates it will have sufficient funds to meet its strategic and working capital requirements, debt service requirements and lease payment obligations for at least twelve months from the issuance of these condensed consolidated financial statements. The Company also had million available to draw from its 2021 Credit Agreement (as defined below) as of September 30, 2024 and its 2025 Notes are due in November 2025, which the Company has the ability to convert the balance due into stock under certain circumstances. If the Company is unable to obtain adequate debt or equity financing when it is required or on terms acceptable to the Company, the Company s ability to grow its business, repay debt and respond to business challenges could be significantly limited. Although management believes its current cash resources are sufficient to sustain operations for one year from issuance of these condensed consolidated financial statements, the success of the Company s operations and the global economic outlook, among other factors, could impact its business and liquidity. The Company will continue to evaluate additional measures, including cost reduction initiatives, debt or equity refinancing, and other similar arrangements. In addition, in October 2024, the Company initiated a cost reduction effort that is expected to reduce headcount by approximately 26 compared to its headcount ending Q2 2024, reduce marketing expenses in the second half of 2024 as well as 2025, and reduce other general expenses. Management considered whether there are conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern and evaluated the funds necessary to maintain operations. Based on the Company s current cash flow projections, the Company has concluded that its available cash and cash equivalents are sufficient to continue operating activities for at least twelve months following the issuance date of these condensed consolidated financial statements.

 million, or of total revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and million, or of total revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Subscription and service revenue as a percentage of 2023 annual revenue was not material. 
 For the Company s camera sale arrangements with multiple performance obligations, revenue is allocated to each performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price. Standalone selling prices are based on observable prices at which the Company separately sells its products, and subscription and service. If a standalone selling price is not directly observable, then the Company estimates the standalone selling prices considering market conditions and entity-specific factors. For example, the standalone selling price for PCS is determined based on a cost-plus approach, which incorporates the level of support provided to customers, estimated costs to provide such support, and the amount of time and costs that are allocated to efforts to develop the undelivered elements. 
 The Company s standard terms and conditions of sale for non-web-based sales do not allow for product returns other than under warranty. However, the Company grants limited rights of return, primarily to certain large retailers. The Company reduces revenue and cost of sales for the estimated returns based on analyses of historical return trends by customer class and other factors. An estimated return liability along with a right to recover assets are recorded for future product returns. Return trends are influenced by product life cycles, new product introductions, market acceptance of products, product sell-through, the type of customer, seasonality, and other factors. Return rates may fluctuate over time but are sufficiently predictable to allow the Company to estimate expected future product returns. 
 The Company provides sales commissions to internal and external sales representatives which are earned in the period in which revenue is recognized. As a result, the Company expenses sales commissions as incurred. 
 Deferred revenue as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, includes amounts related to the Company s subscriptions and PCS. The Company s short-term and long-term deferred revenue balances totaled million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Of the deferred revenue balance as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company recognized million and million of revenue during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and million and million of revenue during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Of the deferred revenue balance as of June 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recognized million and million of revenue during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

 million on United States federal and state deferred tax assets. The Company intends to continue to maintain a full valuation allowance on its United States federal and state deferred tax assets until there is sufficient evidence to support the reversal of all or some portion of these allowances. 
 The Company recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon settlement. Interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are recognized within income tax expense.

 (1) Included in cash and cash equivalents in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Cash balances were million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 Cash equivalents are classified as Level 1 because the Company uses quoted market prices to determine their fair value. Marketable securities are classified as Level 2 because the Company uses alternative pricing sources and models utilizing market observable inputs to determine their fair value. The Company held no marketable securities as of September 30, 2024, and the contractual maturities of available-for-sale marketable securities as of December 31, 2023 were all less than one year in duration. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had no financial assets or liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis that were classified as Level 3, which are valued based on inputs supported by little or no market activity. 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the amortized cost of the Company s cash equivalents and marketable securities approximated their fair value and there were no material realized or unrealized gains or losses, either individually or in the aggregate. 
 In November 2020, the Company issued million principal amount of Convertible Senior Notes due 2025 (2025 Notes) (see Note 5 Financing arrangements). In November 2023, the Company repurchased million in aggregate principal amount of the 2025 Notes. The calculated fair value of the 2025 Notes was million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The estimated fair value of the 2025 Notes is based on quoted market prices of the Company s instruments in markets that are not active and are classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy. The Company estimated the fair value of the 2025 Notes by evaluating quoted market prices and calculating the upfront cash payment a market participant would require to assume these obligations. 
 Equity securities without readily identifiable fair values include the Company s investments in privately-held companies consisting of preferred stock. The Company accounts for these securities at cost, adjusted for changes from observable transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer, less impairments. Fair value of these equity securities is reassessed when the Company identifies observable price changes indicating that an adjustment to the carrying value is necessary. Any observable changes in fair value are recognized in earnings as of the date that the observable transaction took place. In addition, the Company periodically evaluates equity securities without readily determinable fair values to determine if impairment charges are required by evaluating whether an event or change in circumstance has occurred that may have a significant adverse effect on the fair value of the investment. A qualitative assessment is performed each reporting period to assess whether there are any impairment indicators, including, but not limited to, significant deterioration in the investee's earnings performance, credit rating, asset quality or business prospects, adverse change in the regulatory, economic, or technological environment, change in the general market condition of the geographic area or industry, acquisition offers, and the ability to continue as a going concern. If such indicators are present, the Company estimates the fair value of impaired investments and recognizes an impairment loss in the

 million and , which was recorded as a component of other long-term assets. The Company s investments in equity without readily determinable fair value are classified as Level 3 asset due to the lack of observable inputs to determine fair value. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, there have been no impairments or downward or upward adjustments for equity securities without readily determinable fair values. 
 For certain other financial assets and liabilities, including accounts receivable, accounts payable and other current assets and liabilities, the carrying amounts approximate their fair value primarily due to the relatively short maturity of these balances. 
 The Company also measures certain non-financial assets at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, primarily goodwill, intangible assets, and operating lease right-of-use assets, in connection with periodic evaluations for potential impairment.

million. In March 2023, the Company amended the 2021 Credit Agreement (collectively, the 2021 Credit Agreement). The 2021 Credit Agreement will terminate and any outstanding borrowings become due and payable on the earlier of (i) January 2027 and (ii) unless the Company has cash in a specified deposit account in an amount equal to or greater than the amount required to repay the Company s Convertible Senior Notes due November 2025, 91 days prior to the maturity date of such convertible notes. 
 The amount that may be borrowed under the 2021 Credit Agreement may be based on a customary borrowing base calculation if the Company s Asset Coverage Ratio is at any time less than . The Asset Coverage Ratio is defined as the ratio of (i) the sum of (a) the Company s cash and cash equivalents in the United States plus specified percentages of other qualified debt investments (Qualified Cash) plus (b) specified percentages of the net book values of the Company s accounts receivable and certain inventory to (ii) million. 
 Borrowed funds accrue interest at the greater of (i) a per annum rate equal to the base rate plus a margin of from to depending on the Company s Asset Coverage Ratio or (ii) a per annum rate equal to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate plus a 10 basis point premium and a margin of from to depending on the Company s Asset Coverage Ratio. The Company is required to pay a commitment fee on the unused portion of the 2021 Credit Facility of 0.25 per annum. Amounts owed under the 2021 Credit Agreement are guaranteed by certain of the Company s United States subsidiaries and secured by a first priority security interest in substantially all of the assets of the Company and certain of its subsidiaries (other than intellectual property, which is subject to a negative pledge restricting grants of security interests to third parties). 
 The 2021 Credit Agreement contains customary representations, warranties, and affirmative and negative covenants. The negative covenants include restrictions on the incurrence of liens and indebtedness, certain investments, dividends, stock repurchases, and other matters, all subject to certain exceptions. In addition, the Company is required to maintain Liquidity (the sum of unused availability under the credit facility and the Company s Qualified Cash) of at least million (of which at least million shall be attributable to Qualified Cash), or, if the borrowing base is then in effect, minimum unused availability under the credit facility of at least million. The 2021 Credit Agreement also includes customary events of default that include, among other things, non-payment of principal, interest or fees, inaccuracy of representations and warranties, violation of certain covenants, cross default to certain other indebtedness, bankruptcy and insolvency events, material judgments and change of control. Upon an event of default, the lender may, subject to customary cure rights, require the immediate payment of all amounts outstanding. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company was in compliance with all financial covenants contained in the 2021 Credit Agreement and has made no borrowings from the 2021 Credit Facility to date. There is an outstanding

 million for certain duty-related requirements which was not collateralized by any cash on hand. As of September 30, 2024, the Company could borrow up to million under the 2021 Credit Agreement. 
 2025 Convertible Notes 
 In November 2020, the Company issued million aggregate principal amount of Convertible Senior Notes due 2025 (the 2025 Notes) and granted an option to the initial purchasers to purchase up to an additional million aggregate principal amount of the 2025 Notes to cover over-allotments, of which million was subsequently exercised during November 2020, resulting in a total issuance of million aggregate principal amount of the 2025 Notes. The 2025 Notes are senior, unsecured obligations of the Company and mature on November 15, 2025, unless earlier repurchased or converted into shares of Class A common stock under certain circumstances. Prior to August 15, 2025, the 2025 Notes are convertible into cash, shares of the Company s Class A common stock, or a combination thereof, at the Company s election, at an initial conversion rate of shares of Class A common stock per principal amount of the 2025 Notes, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately per share of common stock, subject to adjustment. If the Company does not elect to convert the 2025 Notes into cash, shares of the Company s Class A common stock, or a combination thereof before August 15, 2025, the Company will be deemed to have elected to convert the 2025 Notes in a combination of cash and shares of the Company s Class A common stock. The Company pays interest on the 2025 Notes semi-annually in arrears on May 15 and November 15 of each year. 
 The Company may redeem all or any portion of the 2025 Notes on or after November 20, 2023 for cash if the last reported sale price of the Company s common stock has been at least of the conversion price then in effect for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during any 30 consecutive trading day period (including the last trading day of such period) ending on, and including, the trading day immediately preceding the date on which the Company provides the redemption notice, at a redemption price equal to 100 of the principal amount of the 2025 Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued interest and unpaid interest to, but excluding the redemption date. No sinking fund is provided for the 2025 Notes. The indenture includes customary terms and covenants, including certain events of default after which the 2025 Notes may be due and payable immediately. 
 Holders have the option to convert the 2025 Notes in multiples of principal amount at any time prior to August 15, 2025, but only in the following circumstances: 
 during any calendar quarter beginning after the calendar quarter ending on March 31, 2021, if the last reported sale price of Class A common stock for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during the last 30 consecutive trading days of the immediately preceding fiscal quarter is greater than or equal to of the conversion price of the 2025 Notes on each applicable trading day; 
 during the five-business day period following any five consecutive trading day period in which the trading price for the 2025 Notes is less than of the product of the last reported sale price of Class A common stock and the conversion rate for the 2025 Notes on each such trading day; 
 if the Company calls any or all of the 2025 Notes for redemption, at any time prior to the close of business on the scheduled trading day immediately before the redemption date; or 
 upon the occurrence of specified corporate events. 
 At any time on or after August 15, 2025 until the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date of the 2025 Notes on November 15, 2025, a holder may convert its 2025 Notes, in multiples of principal amount. Holders of the 2025 Notes who convert their 2025 Notes in connection with a make-whole fundamental change (as defined in the indenture) are, under certain circumstances, entitled to an increase in the conversion rate. In addition, in the event of a fundamental change prior to the maturity date, holders will, subject to certain conditions, have the right, at their option, to require the Company to repurchase for cash all or part of the 2025 Notes at a repurchase price equal to 100 of the principal amount of the 2025 Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest up to, but excluding, the repurchase date. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the conditions allowing holders of the 2025 Notes to convert were not met. 
 In connection with the offering of the 2025 Notes, the Company paid million to enter into privately negotiated capped call transactions with certain financial institutions (Capped Calls). The Capped Calls have an 
 17

 Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements 

 per share, which corresponds to the initial conversion price of the 2025 Notes. The Capped Calls cover, subject to anti-dilution adjustments substantially similar to those applicable to the conversion rate of the 2025 Notes, the number of Class A common stock initially underlying the 2025 Notes. The Capped Calls are generally expected to reduce potential dilution to the Company s Class A common stock upon any conversion of the 2025 Notes and/or offset any cash payments the Company is required to make in excess of the principal amount of converted 2025 Notes, as the case may be, with such reduction and/or offset subject to a cap, initially equal to , and is subject to certain adjustments under the terms of the Capped Call transactions. The Capped Calls will expire in November 2025, if not exercised earlier. 
 The Capped Calls are subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified extraordinary events affecting the Company, including merger events, tender offers, and announcement events. In addition, the Capped Calls are subject to certain specified additional disruption events that may give rise to a termination of the Capped Calls, including nationalization, insolvency or delisting, changes in law, failures to deliver, insolvency filings and hedging disruptions. For accounting purposes, the Capped Calls are separate transactions, and not part of the terms of the 2025 Notes. As these transactions meet certain accounting criteria, the Capped Calls are recorded in stockholders equity as a reduction to additional paid-in capital and will not be remeasured as long as they continue to meet certain accounting criteria. 
 In November 2023, the Company repurchased million in aggregate principal amount of the 2025 Notes in exchange for million cash through an individual, privately negotiated transaction. The repurchase was accounted for as a debt extinguishment. The carrying value of the portion of the 2025 Notes repurchased was million, and the Company recognized a gain on the debt extinguishment of million, which was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2023 within other income (expense), net, on the Company s Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the outstanding principal on the 2025 Notes was million and million, respectively, the unamortized debt issuance cost was million and million, respectively, and the net carrying amount of the liability was million and million, respectively, which was recorded as long-term debt within the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recorded interest expense of million and million, respectively, for contractual coupon interest, and million and million, respectively, for amortization of debt issuance costs. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 the Company recorded interest expense of million and million, respectively, for contractual coupon interest, and million and million respectively, for amortization of debt issuance costs. As of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, the effective interest rate, which is calculated as the contractual interest rate adjusted for the debt issuance costs, was and , respectively. 

million of its Class A common stock, and on February 9, 2023, the Company s board of directors authorized the repurchase of an additional million of its Class A common stock. Stock repurchases under the program may be made periodically using a variety of methods, including without limitation, open market purchases, block trades or otherwise in compliance with all federal and state securities laws and state corporate law and in accordance with the single broker, timing, price, and volume guidelines set forth in Rule 10b-18 and Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as such guidelines may be modified by the SEC from time to time. This stock repurchase program has no time limit and may be modified, suspended, or discontinued at any time. The Company currently intends to hold its repurchased shares as treasury stock. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the remaining amount of share repurchases under the program was million. The following table summarizes share repurchases during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

 The Company recorded an income tax expense of million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, on pre-tax net loss of million. The Company s income tax expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 primarily resulted from a tax expense of million on pre-tax book income in certain tax jurisdictions, and discrete items that included million of nondeductible equity tax expense for employee stock-based compensation, partially offset by a net decrease in the valuation allowance of million, an income tax benefit of million related to restructuring charges, and an income tax benefit related to the foreign provision to income tax return adjustments of million. 
 The Company recorded an income tax expense of million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 on pre-tax net loss of million. The Company s income tax expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily resulted from a tax expense of million on pre-tax book income in certain jurisdictions, and discrete items that included million of net tax expense from the recording of a valuation allowance on the Company s United States federal and state net deferred tax assets, and nondeductible equity tax expense for employee stock-based compensation of million, partially offset by an income tax benefit of million related to restructuring charges, and an income tax benefit related to the foreign provision to income tax return adjustments of million. 
 Each quarter, the Company assesses the realizability of its existing deferred tax assets under ASC Topic 740. The Company assesses available positive and negative evidence to estimate whether sufficient future taxable income will be generated to realize its deferred tax assets. In the assessment for the period ended March 31, 2024, the Company concluded based on the introduction of negative evidence resulting from developments in the first quarter of 2024, such as increased and accelerated costs associated with the Company s future product strategy and roadmap, an increased competitive environment, integration and product development costs related to the recent acquisition of Forcite Helmet Systems, restructuring costs and other negative factors, that it was more likely than not that its United States federal and state deferred tax assets would not be realizable. Therefore, in the period ended March 31, 2024, after consideration of the Company s deferred tax liabilities and recent developments, the Company provided a valuation allowance of million on United States federal and state deferred tax assets. That determination was also based, in part, on the Company s revised expectation that its projections of pre-tax losses in 2024 and future years will cause the Company to be in a cumulative GAAP loss for ASC Topic 740 purposes in 2024 and forward. In the assessment for the period ended September 30, 2024, the Company concluded that it remains more likely than not that the Company will not be able to realize its deferred tax assets. The Company will continue to monitor its future financial results, expected projections and their potential impact on the Company s assessment regarding the recoverability of its deferred tax asset balances and in the event there is a need to release the valuation allowance, a tax benefit would be recorded. The Company s foreign deferred tax assets in each jurisdiction are supported by taxable income or in the case of acquired companies, by the future reversal of deferred tax liabilities. It is more likely than not that the Company s foreign deferred tax assets will be realized and thus, a valuation allowance is not required on its foreign deferred tax assets.

 million on a pre-tax net loss of million. The Company s income tax expense for the three months ended September 30, 2023 was composed of million of tax benefit incurred on pre-tax loss, and discrete items that primarily included million of nondeductible equity tax expense for employee stock-based compensation, million of tax expense related to restructuring charges, and million of tax benefit related to the foreign provision to income tax return adjustments. The Company recorded an income tax benefit of million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 on a pre-tax net loss of million. The Company s income tax benefit for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was composed of million of tax benefit incurred on pre-tax loss, and discrete items that primarily included million of net nondeductible equity tax expense for employee stock-based compensation, million of tax expense related to the foreign provision to income tax return adjustments, and million of tax expense related to the restructuring charges. 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company s gross unrecognized tax benefits were million and million, respectively. If recognized, million of these unrecognized tax benefits (net of United States federal benefit) as of September 30, 2024 would reduce income tax expense. A material portion of the Company s gross unrecognized tax benefits, if recognized, would increase the Company s net operating loss carryforward, which would be offset by a full valuation allowance based on present circumstances. 
 The Company conducts business globally and as a result, files income tax returns in the United States and foreign jurisdictions. The Company s unrecognized tax benefits relate primarily to unresolved matters with taxing authorities. While it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular uncertain tax position, the Company believes that its reserves reflect the more likely outcome. The Company believes, primarily due to the statute of limitations expiration, that within the next 12 months, it is possible that up to million of uncertain tax positions could be released. It is also reasonably possible that additional uncertain tax positions will be added. It is not reasonably possible at this time to quantify the net effect. 
 In 2021, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) established an inclusive framework on base erosion and profit shifting and agreed on a two-pillar solution (Pillar Two) to global taxation, focusing on global profit allocation and a global minimum effective tax rate. On December 15, 2022, the EU member states agreed to implement the OECD s global minimum tax rate of . The OECD issued Pillar Two model rules and continues to release guidance on these rules. The inclusive framework calls for tax law changes by participating countries to take effect in 2024 and 2025. Various countries have enacted or have announced plans to enact new tax laws to implement the global minimum tax. The Company assessed the impact of Pillar Two and there is no material impact to the provision for income taxes for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. The Company will continue to monitor future guidance issued and assess the potential impact to the Company s condensed consolidated financial statements.

 Legal proceedings and investigations. Since 2015, Contour IP Holdings LLC (CIPH) and related entities have filed lawsuits in various federal district courts alleging, among other things, patent infringement in relation to certain GoPro products. Following litigation in federal courts and the United States Patent and Trademark Office, CIPH s patents were ruled invalid in March 2022. Judgment was then entered in favor of the Company and against CIPH. CIPH later appealed to the Federal Circuit. On September 9, 2024, the Federal Circuit panel reversed the district court ruling. On October 9, 2024, GoPro filed a petition for rehearing of the panel s decision. 
 On March 29, 2024, the Company filed a complaint with the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) against Arashi Vision Inc., d/b/a Insta360, and Arashi Vision (U.S.) LLC, d/b/a Insta360, and a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California against Arashi Vision Inc., d/b/a Insta360, and Arashi Vision (U.S.) LLC, d/b/a Insta360. The complaint and lawsuit each allege infringement of certain GoPro patents related to the Company s cameras and digital imaging technology. Insta360 has since filed inter partes review (IPR) petitions seeking to challenge the validity of the GoPro patents asserted against Insta360. Insta360 has also filed a patent infringement action against the Company in China (Jiangsu High Court), which the Company believes lacks merit and intends to defend against. 
 The Company regularly evaluates the associated developments of the legal proceedings described above, as well as other legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business. While litigation is inherently uncertain,

 Overview 
 GoPro helps the world capture and share itself in immersive and exciting ways. We are committed to developing solutions that create an easy, seamless experience for consumers to capture, create and share engaging personal content. When consumers use our products and services, they often generate and share content that organically increases awareness for GoPro, driving a virtuous cycle and a self-reinforcing demand for our products. We believe revenue growth may be driven by the introduction of new products, accessories, lifestyle gear, and software and subscription offerings. We believe new camera features drive a replacement cycle among existing users and attract new users, expanding our total addressable market. Our investments in image stabilization, mobile app editing and sharing solutions, modular accessories, auto-upload capabilities, local language user-interfaces and voice recognition in more than 11 languages with 6 accents are designed to drive the expansion of our global market. 
 In September 2024, we began shipping our HERO13 Black flagship camera that includes our GP2 processor, HyperSmooth 6.0 image stabilization, hybrid-log gamma (HLG) high dynamic range (HDR) photos and videos in 5.3K at 60 frames per second (FPS) and 4K at 60 FPS, and a higher capacity battery resulting in longer runtimes and improved thermal performance. HyperSmooth 6.0 image stabilization features AutoBoost, which analyzes up to 4x more data compared to HyperSmooth 5.0 while supporting 360-degree Horizon Lock. The HERO13 Black also includes 10-bit color video at up to 5.3K video at 60 FPS, 27-megapixel photo resolution, 8:7 aspect ratio video for a larger vertical field of view, and HyperView, which allows for a 16:9 field of view. The HERO13 Black also includes a front-facing and rear touch display, TimeWarp 3.0, a Timecode Sync feature, and a Night Effects Time Lapse feature. We also offer our Ultra Wide Lens Mod, Macro Lens Mod and a ND Filter 4-Pack for HERO13 Black. The Ultra Wide Lens Mod allows for an ultra wide-angle digital lens for 4K video at 60 FPS, the Macro Lens Mod allows the HERO13 Black to focus on objects 4x closer than prior generation cameras and the ND Filter 4-Pack allows the HERO13 Black to create motion blur. Additionally, we offer our HERO13 Black Creator 
 28

 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

 Edition, which combines the HERO13 Black, Volta, Enduro Battery, Media Mod, and Light Mod to create professional-quality videos. 
 In September 2024, we also began shipping our smallest and lightest version of a HERO camera which features a one-button design and touch display. The HERO camera can shoot videos at up to 4K at 30 FPS, captures photos with 12-megapixel resolution, and has a slow-motion setting of up to 2.7K at 60 FPS. The HERO camera captures content with a wide field of view lens so that HyperSmooth image stabilization can be applied in the Quik app. 
 Our HERO13 Black, HERO13 Black Creator Edition, HERO, HERO12 Black, HERO12 Black Creator Edition, HERO11 Black, HERO11 Black Mini, HERO11 Black Creator Edition, and MAX cameras are compatible with our ecosystem of mountable and wearable accessories. 
 We offer our Premium subscription, which includes unlimited cloud storage of GoPro content supporting source video and photo quality, damaged camera replacement, cloud storage up to 25 gigabytes (GB) of non-GoPro content, the delivery of highlight videos automatically via our mobile app when GoPro camera footage is uploaded to the user s GoPro cloud account using Auto Upload. Our Premium subscription also provides access to a high-quality live streaming service on GoPro.com, as well as discounts on GoPro cameras, gear, mounts and accessories. In February 2024, we launched our Premium+ subscription which includes cloud storage up to 500 GB of non-GoPro content, HyperSmooth Pro and all of the same features included in the Premium subscription. 
 In addition to the Premium+ and Premium subscriptions, we offer our Quik subscription which makes it easy for users to get the most out of their favorite photos and videos, captured on any phone or camera, using our Quik mobile app s editing tools. These editing tools include features such as trim, color, crop, filtering, auto-sync of edits to music, and the ability to change video speed. We believe the Quik subscription is an important offering in expanding our total addressable market to those who may not own a GoPro camera. 
 We continue to monitor the current evolving macroeconomic landscape. Inflation, fluctuating interest rates, a strengthening United States dollar (U.S. dollar), and recession concerns places increasing pressure on many areas of our business, including product pricing, operating expenses, component pricing and consumer spending. In the past, the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to other foreign currencies largely impacted our revenue and gross margin. If the U.S. dollar strengthens relative to other foreign currencies in the future, our financial results will be negatively impacted. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for further discussion of the possible impact of evolving macroeconomic conditions on our business.

 (5) In the first quarter of 2024, we revised the income tax adjustment to reflect current and deferred income tax expense (benefit) and the effect of non-GAAP adjustments to better align with SEC guidance. For comparative purposes, we have revised our prior period income tax adjustments to reflect current and deferred income tax expense (benefit) and the effect of non-GAAP adjustments. Additionally, in the second quarter of 2024, we revised the first quarter of 2024 income tax adjustment to exclude the establishment of a valuation allowance on United States federal and state deferred tax assets. 
 Reconciliations of non-GAAP adjusted measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures and explanations for why we consider non-GAAP measures to be helpful for investors are presented under Non-GAAP Financial Measures. 
 Third quarter 2024 financial performance 
 
 Revenue for the third quarter of 2024 was 258.9 million, which represented a 12.0 decrease from the same period in 2023. The year-over-year decrease was primarily driven by a 4.6 decrease in units shipped in the quarter of 881 thousand, compared to 923 thousand in the same period in 2023 and an increase in third quarter sales incentives, partially offset by a 10.6 increase in our subscription and service revenue. The continued consumer-related macroeconomic issues resulting in a softer consumer market in the Americas and Asia-Pacific regions, particularly in China, and an increasingly global competitive landscape, notably in China, negatively impacted the third quarter of 2024 sell-in and sell-through. Our third quarter of 2024 camera revenue mix from cameras with an MSRP equal to or greater than 400 was 74 compared to 75 for the same period in 2023. Our third quarter of 2024 average selling price decreased 7.8 year-over-year to 294, primarily due to a 38.2 increase in unit sales of entry level priced cameras, a reduction of 300 and above camera unit sales, as well as an increase in promotional activity, partially offset by an increase in our subscription and service revenue. Average selling price is defined as total reported revenue divided by camera units shipped. Retail revenue was 207.9 million in the third quarter of 2024 and represented 80.3 of total revenue, compared to 78.5 of total revenue

 for the same period in 2023. GoPro.com revenue, which includes subscription and service revenue, was 51.0 million in the third quarter of 2024 and represented 19.7 of total revenue, compared to 21.5 of total revenue for the same period in 2023. Our overall subscription attach rate from both sales on GoPro.com and from post-camera purchases at retail was 45 in the third quarter of 2024. Our aggregate retention rate for annual subscribers was 67 in the third quarter of 2024, compared to 65 in the same period in 2023, a 4 improvement. Our gross margin percentage for the third quarter of 2024 was 35.5 , an increase of 3.50 year-over year. Net loss for the third quarter of 2024 was 8.2 million compared to a net loss of 3.7 million in the same period in 2023. Adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter of 2024 was 5.4 million, compared to 7.2 million for the same period in 2023. Cash was down slightly sequentially, and inventory was slightly up year-over-year in preparation for the upcoming holiday season in the fourth quarter of 2024. 
 Our overall subscription attach rate from camera purchases through both GoPro.com and at retail represents the number of new GoPro subscribers in the period over the corresponding number of estimated camera units sold through both GoPro.com and retail channels. Our aggregate retention rate for annual subscribers represents the percent of annual subscribers that renewed their subscription in the period, over the total corresponding renewal events. 
 Factors affecting performance 
 We believe that our future success will be dependent on many factors, including those further discussed below. While these areas represent opportunities for us, they also represent challenges and risks that we must successfully address in order to operate our business and improve our results of operations. 
 Driving profitability through improved efficiency, lower costs, and better execution. We incurred an operating loss in the first nine months of 2024, and for the full year 2023. We continue to make strategic decisions to drive volume, growth, and profitability in our business. Restructuring actions in 2024 and prior restructuring actions, along with continued cost management have resulted in a more efficient global organization that has allowed for improved communication and alignment among our functional teams. We are changing our approach to operate in a leaner, more focused manner that we believe is sustainable and strategic for long-term success and improved financial performance. This includes reducing our operating expenses to the lowest level since before going public, while pursuing a product roadmap we believe will drive innovation, differentiation, and growth. And, in the longer term, increasing our total addressable market by introducing new and innovative products, increasing unit sales volume of our existing products, and increasing our subscriber base. Our expectation is that sales from our retail channel will continue to increase relative to sales on GoPro.com . While growth in subscribers and subscription and service revenue has slowed, we continue to make strategic decisions to enhance our subscription offerings to increase subscriber retention and increase subscription and service revenue. 
 If we are unable to generate adequate unit sales and revenue growth, successfully increase our total addressable market, successfully increase retail sales, successfully manage sales incentive levels, grow subscribers and subscription and service revenue, effectively manage our expenses, and navigate the volatile macroeconomic environment (including fluctuating interest rates and currency exchange rates, and recession concerns), we may incur significant losses in the future and may not be able to return to profitability. 
 Investing in research and development and enhancing our customer experience. Our performance is significantly dependent on the investments we make in research and development, including our ability to attract and retain highly skilled and experienced research and development personnel. We expect the timing of new product releases to continue to have a significant impact on our revenue and we must continually develop and introduce innovative new cameras, software, and other new offerings. We plan to further build upon our integrated mobile and cloud-based storytelling solutions, as well as our subscription offerings. Our investments, including those for marketing and advertising, and those related to development efforts associated with our most recent acquisition, may not successfully drive increased revenue and our customers may not accept our new offerings. If we fail to innovate and enhance our brand, our products, our mobile app experience, or the value proposition of our subscription, our market position and revenue will be adversely affected. Further, we have and will continue to incur substantial research and development expenses and if our efforts are not successful, we may not recover the value of these investments and our business may be adversely affected.

 Improving profitability. We believe that our continued focus on growing our total addressable market from our retail and GoPro.com channels, including subscription and service revenue, and broadening our range of products will support our ability to return to profitability on an annual basis due to timely and effective product launches, increases in unit volume, subscribers and related revenue, and continued operating expense control. We c ontinue to believe that international markets represent a significant opportunity to achieve profitability. While the total market for digital cameras has seen an increase in competition, we believe that our consumers differentiated use of GoPro cameras, our mobile app and cloud solutions, our continued innovation of product features desired by our users, and our brand, all help support our competitiveness within the market for digital camera. However, we expect that the markets in which we conduct our business will remain highly competitive as we face new product introductions from competitors. Sales in international locations subject us to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and regional macroeconomic conditions that may cause us to adjust pricing which may make our products more or less attractive to the consumer. Continued fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and regional macroeconomic conditions could have a continued impact on our future operating results. 
 Our profitability also depends on the continued success of our subscription and service offerings. If we are not successful in maintaining our product sales, and subscription and service offerings, increasing our paid subscriber base, retail mobile app attach, and improving subscriber retention, we may not be able to return to profitably and we may not recognize benefits from our investment in new areas. 
 Marketing the improved GoPro experience. We intend to focus our marketing resources on highlighting our camera features, subscription and service benefits, and further improve brand recognition. Historically, our growth has largely been fueled by the adoption of our products by people looking to self-capture images of themselves participating in exciting physical activities. Our goal of returning to profitability depends on continuing to reach, expand and re-engage with this core user base in alignment with our strategic priorities. Sales and marketing investments will often occur in advance of any sales benefits from these activities, and it may be difficult for us to determine if we are efficiently allocating our resources in this area. 
 Seasonality. Historically, we have experienced the highest levels of total revenue in the fourth quarter of the year, coinciding with the holiday shopping season, particularly in the United States and Europe. However, in the current year, we do not expect this trend to continue due to macroeconomic conditions and competition globally. While we have implemented operational changes aimed at reducing the impact of fourth quarter seasonality on full year performance, timely and effective product introductions, whether just prior to the holiday season or otherwise, and forecasting, are critical to our operations and financial performance. 
 Macroeconomic risks. Macroeconomic conditions affecting the level of consumer spending include market volatility and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, inflation, and interest rates. Some product costs have become subject to inflationary pressure, and we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs through price increases. Our inability or failure to adjust pricing could harm our business, financial condition, and operating results.

 Revenue for the third quarter of 2024 was 258.9 million, which represented a 12.0 decrease from the same period in 2023. The year-over-year decrease was primarily driven by a 4.6 decrease in units shipped in the quarter of 881 thousand, compared to 923 thousand in the same period in 2023 and an increase in third quarter sales incentives, partially offset by a 10.6 increase in our subscription and service revenue. The continued consumer-related macroeconomic issues resulting in a softer consumer market in the Americas and Asia-Pacific regions, particularly in China, and an increasingly global competitive landscape, notably in China, negatively impacted the third quarter of 2024 sell-in and sell-through. Our third quarter of 2024 camera revenue mix from cameras with an MSRP equal to or greater than 400 was 74 compared to 75 for the same period in 2023. Our third quarter of 2024 average selling price decreased 7.8 year-over-year to 294, primarily due to a 38.2 increase in unit sales of entry level priced cameras, a reduction of 300 and above camera unit sales, as well as an increase in promotional activity, partially offset by an increase in our subscription and service revenue. Retail revenue was 207.9 million in the third quarter of 2024 and represented 80.3 of total revenue, compared to 78.5 of total revenue for the same period in 2023. GoPro.com revenue, which includes subscription and service revenue, was 51.0 million in the third quarter of 2024 and represented 19.7 of total revenue, compared to 21.5 of total revenue for the same period in 2023. 
 Revenue for the first nine months of 2024 was 600.6 million, or a 15.4 decrease from the same period in 2023. This was primarily driven by the impact of our May 2023 strategic pricing decision to reduce the MSRPs across our camera line up and a corresponding shift in camera revenue mix as we offered entry level cameras at a sub- 300 price point for the first time since 2019, and an 11.4 decrease in units shipped for the first nine months of 2024 of 1.9 million, compared to 2.1 million in the same period in 2023, partially offset by a 30.9 million decrease in price protection charges. In the first nine months of 2024, our average selling price decreased 4.5 year-over-year to 325 and our camera revenue mix from cameras with an MSRP equal to or greater than 400 was 74 compared to 78 for the same period in 2023. In the first nine months of 2024, our subscription and service revenue increased 10.1 to 79.7 million, which is included in the GoPro.com channel. GoPro.com revenue represented 24.8 and 32.9 of total revenue for the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, respectively, while retail revenue represented 75.2 and 67.1 of total revenue for the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, respectively. The growth of the retail channel was partially due to adding more than 6,300 new retail doors since the third quarter of 2023.

 Gross margin of 35.5 for the third quarter of 2024 increased from 32.0 in the same period of 2023, or 350 bps, primarily due to lower operational costs primarily related to reduced tariff expenses and improved warranty expenses (260 bps), a cost reduction of our entry level price point camera (240 bps), improved subscription related operating costs, an increase in annual revenue per user and an increase in subscription revenue as a percentage of total revenue (130 bps), and lower prior generation camera costs (65 bps). These improvements were partially offset by an increase in promotions (300 bps) and fluctuations in foreign currency (75 bps). 
 Gross margin of 33.6 for the first nine months 2024 increased from 31.3 in the same period of 2023, or 230 bps, primarily due to lower camera costs (360 bps), lower operational costs (210 bps), and an increase in subscription and service revenue (160 bps), partially offset by a decrease in camera pricing, net of promotions (390 bps), and less accessory revenue (110 bps).

 Restructuring costs 
 Third quarter 2024 restructuring. In August 2024, we approved a restructuring plan (the Original Restructuring Plan) to reduce operating costs by reducing our global workforce by approximately 15 . In October 2024, we approved an amended restructuring plan (the Updated Restructuring Plan) to increase the reduction of our global workforce to approximately 26 compared to our headcount ending Q2 2024. In connection with the Original Restructuring Plan, we recorded restructuring charges of 1.1 million related to severance. Under the Updated Restructuring Plan, we expect to incur up to 9 million of severance related charges and up to 8 million of project cancellation costs in the fourth quarter of 2024. 
 First quarter 2024 restructuring. In March 2024, we approved a restructuring plan to reduce operating costs and drive stronger operating leverage by reducing our global workforce by approximately 4 and certain office space. Under the first quarter 2024 restructuring plan, we recorded restructuring charges of 2.3 million related to severance and 3.3 million related to a right-of-use asset impairment upon ceasing the use of certain office space and 0.4 million related to office space charges. As of September 30, 2024, the remaining future lease related payments associated with certain office space vacated as a result of the first quarter 2024 restructuring plan are anticipated to be approximately 1.9 million and will be paid over the underlying remaining lease term.

 0.4 million decrease in cash interest expense as we extinguished part of our 2025 Notes in the fourth quarter of 2023, partially offset by overall lower cash and investment balances resulting in a 1.4 million decrease in interest income. 
 Total other income, net was income of 2.4 million in the first nine months of 2024 compared to income of 3.8 million for the same period of 2023. The year-over-year change of 1.3 million was primarily due to overall lower cash and investment balances resulting in a 4.1 million decrease in interest income, partially offset by a 1.2 million decrease in cash interest expense as we extinguished part of our 2025 Notes in the fourth quarter of 2023, a 1.0 million gain on the sale of intellectual property, and a 0.5 million decrease in net foreign exchange rate-based losses.

 We recorded an income tax expense of 2.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, on pre-tax net loss of 6.1 million. Our income tax expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 primarily resulted from a tax expense of 2.1 million on pre-tax book income in certain tax jurisdictions, and discrete items that included 1.9 million of nondeductible equity tax expense for employee stock-based compensation, partially offset by a net decrease in the valuation allowance of 1.6 million, an income tax benefit of 0.3 million related to restructuring charges, and an income tax benefit related to the foreign provision to income tax return adjustments of 0.1 million. 
 We recorded an income tax expense of 301.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 on pre-tax net loss of 93.5 million. Our income tax expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily resulted from a tax expense on pre-tax book income in certain jurisdictions of 5.0 million, and discrete items that included 293.4 million of net tax expense from the recording of a valuation allowance on United States federal and state net deferred tax assets, and nondeductible equity tax expense for stock-based compensation of 4.9 million, partially offset by an income tax benefit of 1.3 million related to restructuring charges, and an income tax benefit related to the foreign provision to income tax return adjustments of 0.5 million. 
 Each quarter, we assess the realizability of our existing deferred tax assets under ASC Topic 740. We assess available positive and negative evidence to estimate whether sufficient future taxable income will be generated to realize our deferred tax assets. In the assessment for the period ended March 31, 2024, we concluded based on the introduction of negative evidence resulting from developments in the first quarter of 2024, such as increased and accelerated costs associated with our future product strategy and roadmap, an increased competitive environment, integration and product development costs related to the recent acquisition of Forcite Helmet Systems, restructuring costs and other negative factors, that it was more likely than not that our deferred tax assets related to United States federal and state deferred tax assets would not be realizable. Therefore, in the period ended March 31, 2024, after consideration of our deferred tax liabilities and recent developments, we provided a valuation allowance of 294.9 million on United States federal and state deferred tax assets. We intend to continue maintaining a full valuation allowance on our United States federal and state deferred tax assets until there is sufficient evidence to support the reversal of all or some portion of these allowances. That determination was also based, in part, on our revised expectation that our projections of pre-tax losses in 2024 and future years will cause us to be in a cumulative GAAP loss for ASC Topic 740 purposes in 2024 and forward. In the assessment for the period ended September 30, 2024, we concluded that it remains more likely than not that we will not be able to realize our deferred tax assets. We will continue to monitor our future financial results, expected projections and the potential impact on our assessment regarding the recoverability of our deferred tax asset balances and in the event there is a need to release the valuation allowance, a tax benefit would be recorded. Our foreign deferred tax assets in each jurisdiction are supported by taxable income or in the case of acquired companies, by the future reversal of deferred tax liabilities. It is more likely than not that our foreign deferred tax assets will be realized and thus, a valuation allowance is not required on our foreign deferred tax assets.

 In 2021, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) established an inclusive framework on base erosion and profit shifting and agreed on a two-pillar solution (Pillar Two) to global taxation, focusing on global profit allocation and a 15 global minimum effective tax rate. On December 15, 2022, the EU member states agreed to implement the OECD s global minimum tax rate of 15 . The OECD issued Pillar Two model rules and continues to release guidance on these rules. The inclusive framework calls for tax law changes by participating countries to take effect in 2024 and 2025. Various countries have enacted or have announced plans to enact new tax laws to implement the global minimum tax. We assessed the impact of Pillar Two and there is no material impact to our provision for income taxes for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. We will continue to monitor future guidance issued and assess the potential impact to our condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 See Note 9 Income taxes, to the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 The following table presents selected financial information as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023: 
 (dollars in thousands) September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Cash and cash equivalents 130,195 222,708 Marketable securities 23,867 Total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities 130,195 246,575 Percentage of total assets 20 25 
 Our primary source of cash is receipts from sales of our products, and subscription and service. Other sources of cash are from proceeds from the issuance of convertible notes, employee participation in the employee stock purchase plan, the exercise of employee stock options, and facility subleases. Our primary uses of cash are for inventory procurement, payroll-related expenses, general operating expenses, including advertising, marketing, office rent, purchases of property and equipment, other costs of revenue, share repurchases, repurchases of convertible notes, acquisitions, interest, and taxes. 
 Our liquidity position has been historically impacted by seasonality, which is primarily driven by higher revenues during the second half of the year as compared to the first half. For example, net cash provided by operating activities during the second half of 2023 was 42.1 million, compared to cash used by operating activities of 75.0 million during the first half of 2023. 
 As of September 30, 2024, our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities totaled 130.2 million. Our cash, net of the outstanding principal balance of the 2025 Notes, as of September 30, 2024, was 36.4 million. The overall cash used in operating activities of 100.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily attributable to a net loss of 395.1 million and net cash outflows from changes in our working capital of 32.7 million, partially offset by a deferred tax asset expense of 296.8 million, and net cash inflows from other non-cash expenses of 31.0 million. Working capital changes for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 of 32.7 million were the result of an increase in inventory of 49.0 million, an increase in accounts receivable of 41.7 million, an increase in prepaid expenses and other assets of 4.7 million and a decrease in deferred revenue of 2.1 million, partially offset by an increase in accounts payable and other liabilities of 64.8 million. As of September 30, 2024, 15.5 million of cash was held by our foreign subsidiaries. 
 Convertible Notes 
 In November 2020, we issued 143.8 million aggregate principal amount of 2025 Notes in a private placement to purchasers for resale to qualified institutional buyers. In November 2023, we repurchased 50.0 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2025 Notes, reducing the amount owed on the 2025 Notes to 93.8 million. The 2025 Notes mature on November 15, 2025, unless earlier repurchased or converted into shares of Class A common stock subject to certain conditions. The 2025 Notes are convertible into cash, shares of the Class A common stock, or a combination thereof, at our election, at an initial conversion rate of 107.1984 shares of 
 38 

GoPro, Inc. 
 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

 common stock per 1,000 principal amount of the 2025 Notes, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately 9.3285 per share of common stock, subject to adjustment. We pay interest on the 2025 Notes semi-annually, which is due on May 15 and November 15 of each year. 
 In connection with the offering of the 2025 Notes, we entered into privately negotiated capped call transactions with certain financial institutions (Capped Calls). We used 10.2 million of the net proceeds from the sale of the 2025 Notes to purchase the Capped Calls and 56.2 million of the net proceeds to repurchase 50.0 million of the 175.0 million aggregate principal amount of the 2022 Notes, which we issued in April 2017. The remaining net proceeds were used for general corporate purposes. 
 As market and financial conditions warrant, we may, from time to time, repurchase our outstanding debt securities in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions, by tender offer, by exchange transaction or otherwise. Such repurchases, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity and other factors and may be commenced or suspended at any time. The amounts involved and total consideration paid may be material. 
 Other Contractual Commitments 
 In the ordinary course of business, we enter into multi-year agreements to purchase sponsorships with event organizers, resorts, and athletes as part of our marketing efforts, software licenses related to our financial and IT systems, operating lease arrangements to support our operations in the U.S. and international locations, and various other contractual commitments. The following table summarizes our other contractual obligations as of September 30, 2024, and the expected timing of those payments: 
 (in thousands) Total Next 12 Months Beyond 12 Months Operating lease obligations (1) 
 36,201 12,707 23,494 Other contractual commitments 224,395 55,587 168,808 Total contractual cash obligations 260,596 68,294 192,302 
 (1) Operating lease obligations exclude cash inflows from existing contractual facility subleases through the end of 2026. 
 See Note 10 Commitments, contingencies, and guarantees, for a discussion regarding facility leases and other contractual commitments in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 Liquidity 
 Based on our most current projections, we believe that our available cash and cash equivalents, and amounts available under our credit facility, will be sufficient to address our working capital needs, capital expenditures, outstanding commitments, and other liquidity requirements for at least one year from the issuance of these financial statements. 
 We expect that operating expenses and inventory purchases will constitute a material use of our cash balances. We intend to continue to manage our operating activities in line with our existing cash and available financial resources. 
 In January 2021, we entered into the 2021 Credit Agreement, which provides for a revolving credit facility under which we may borrow up to an aggregate amount of 50.0 million. As amended in March 2023, our credit facility will terminate and any outstanding borrowings become due and payable on the earlier of (i) January 2027 and (ii) unless we have cash in a specified deposit account in an amount equal to or greater than the amount required to repay our 1.25 convertible senior notes due November 2025, 91 days prior to the maturity date of such convertible notes. As of September 30, 2024, we could borrow up to 44.8 million under the 2021 Credit Agreement. No borrowings have been made from the credit facility to date (See Note 5 Financing arrangements, in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information). 
 The 93.8 million aggregate principal amount of the 2025 Notes matures on November 15, 2025, unless earlier repurchased or converted into shares of Class A common stock subject to certain conditions. We intend to deliver cash up to the principal amount of the 2025 Notes, based on our current and projected liquidity levels.

GoPro, Inc. 
 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

 As of September 30, 2024, we had 130.2 million in cash and cash equivalents. Based on our current cash balance, our proactive cost reductions implemented to date, and working capital adjustments, we anticipate we will have sufficient funds to meet our strategic and working capital requirements, debt service requirements and lease payment obligations for at least twelve months from the issuance of these condensed consolidated financial statements. We also have 44.8 million available to draw from our 2021 Credit Agreement as of September 30, 2024 and as our 2025 Notes are due in November 2025, we have the ability to convert the balance due into stock. If we are unable to obtain adequate debt or equity financing when we require it or on terms acceptable to us, our ability to grow our business, repay debt and respond to business challenges could be significantly limited. Although we believe our current cash resources are sufficient to sustain operations for one year from issuance of these condensed consolidated financial statements, the success of our operations and the global economic outlook, among other factors, could impact our business and liquidity. We will continue to evaluate additional measures, including cost reduction initiatives, debt refinancing, and other similar arrangements. In addition, in October 2024, we initiated a cost reduction effort that will reduce headcount by approximately 26 compared to our headcount ending Q2 2024, reduce marketing expenses in the second half of 2024 as well as 2025, and reduce other general expenses. We considered whether there were conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern and evaluate the funds necessary to maintain operations. Based on our current cash flow projections, we concluded that our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities are sufficient to continue operating activities for at least twelve months following the issuance date of these condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 Summary of Cash Flow 
 The following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods indicated: 
 Nine months ended September 30, (in thousands) 
 2024 2023 Change Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities 
 (100,042) (76,592) 31 Investing activities 
 8,069 107,437 (92) Financing activities 
 (697) (33,270) (98) 
 Cash flows from operating activities 
 Cash used in operating activities of 100.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily attributable to a net loss of 395.1 million and net cash outflows from changes in our working capital of 32.7 million, partially offset by a deferred tax asset expense of 296.8 million, and net cash inflows from other non-cash expenses of 31.0 million. Working capital changes for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 of 32.7 million were the result of an increase in inventory of 49.0 million, an increase in accounts receivable of 41.7 million, an increase in prepaid expenses and other assets of 4.7 million and a decrease in deferred revenue of 2.1 million, partially offset by an increase in accounts payable and other liabilities of 64.8 million. 
 Cash flows from investing activities 
 Cash provided by investing activities of 8.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily attributable to maturities of marketable securities of 24.0 million, partially offset by 12.3 million of net cash used to acquire Forcite Helmet Systems, and net purchases of property and equipment of 3.6 million. 
 Cash flows from financing activities 
 Cash used in financing activities of 0.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily attributable to 2.8 million in tax payments for net restricted stock unit (RSU) settlements, partially offset by 2.2 million of cash inflows from stock purchases made through our employee stock purchase plan.

 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 There have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates from those disclosed in our 2023 Annual Report, except for estimates used in our goodwill impairment analysis and assessment of the recoverability of our deferred tax assets. 
 Impairment of goodwill 
 We perform an annual assessment of our goodwill during the fourth quarter of each calendar year or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist, such as an adverse change in business climate, declines in market capitalization or a decline in the overall industry demand, that would indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of our single reporting unit is less than the carrying value. If we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of our single reporting unit is less than the carrying value, we measure the amount of impairment as the amount the carrying value of our single reporting unit exceeds the fair value, up to the carrying value of goodwill, by using a discounted cash flow method and market approach method. 
 Although our market capitalization further declined in the third quarter of 2024, we do not believe that it is more likely than not that the fair value of our single reporting unit is less than the carrying value. Using the market capitalization approach, which we would expect to be similar to the discounted cash flow method, the fair value of our single reporting unit is estimated based on the trading price of our stock at the test date, which is further adjusted by an acquisition control premium representing the synergies a market participant would obtain when obtaining control of the business. As of September 30, 2024, the market capitalization exceeded the carrying value of our single reporting unit by 13 , which was not adjusted for an acquisition control premium which would further increase the percentage the fair value exceeded the carrying value. 
 The estimated fair value of our single reporting unit is sensitive to the volatility in our stock price. For example, a 5 decrease in our September 30, 2024 stock price would result in our market capitalization exceeding the carrying value of our single reporting unit by 8 , which is not adjusted for an acquisition control premium. If our market capitalization continues to decline or future performance falls below our current expectations, assumptions, or estimates, including assumptions related to current macroeconomic uncertainties, this may trigger a future material non-cash goodwill impairment charge, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations in the reporting period in which a charge would be necessary. We will continue to monitor developments, including updates to our forecasts and market capitalization. An update of our assessment and related estimates may be required in the future. 
 Income taxes 
 We are subject to income taxes in the United States and multiple foreign jurisdictions. Our effective tax rates differ from the United States federal statutory rate, primarily due to changes in our valuation allowance, the effect of non-United States operations, deductible and non-deductible stock-based compensation expense, state taxes, federal and state research and development tax credits and other adjustments. The calculation of our provision for income taxes involves the use of estimates, assumptions and judgments while taking into account current tax laws, our interpretation of current tax laws and possible outcomes of future tax audits. We review our tax positions quarterly and adjust the balances as new information becomes available. 
 Each quarter, we assess the realizability of our existing deferred tax assets under ASC Topic 740. We assess available positive and negative evidence to estimate whether sufficient future taxable income will be generated to realize our deferred tax assets. For the year ended December 31, 2023, we continued to believe that it was more likely than not that our United States federal and state and foreign deferred tax assets would be realized and thus, a valuation allowance was not required on our deferred tax assets. Key considerations included a three-year cumulative income position with two years of income and a positive trend in our retail strategy in 2023, and we expected this retail strategy would favorably impact profitability in 2024 with a full year positive impact expected in 2025. During the first quarter of 2024, recent developments negatively impacted our assessment, and these included increased and accelerated costs associated with our future product strategy and roadmap, an increased competitive environment, integration and product development costs related to the recent acquisition of Forcite Helmet Systems, restructuring costs and other negative factors. Thus, as of March 31, 2024, we concluded that it was more likely than not that the United States federal and state deferred tax assets were not realizable and established a valuation allowance. 
 41 

GoPro, Inc. 
 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

 Our foreign deferred tax assets in each jurisdiction are supported by taxable income or in the case of acquired companies, by the future reversal of deferred tax liabilities. It is more likely than not that our foreign deferred tax assets will be realized and thus, a valuation allowance is not required on our foreign deferred tax assets. 

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 We report net income (loss) and diluted net income (loss) per share in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and on a non-GAAP basis. We additionally report non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA. We use non-GAAP financial measures to help us understand and evaluate our core operating performance and trends, to prepare and approve our annual budget, and to develop short-term and long-term operational plans. Our management uses and believes that investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our operating results. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as an alternative to, the measures prepared in accordance with GAAP, and are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. We believe that these non-GAAP measures, when read in conjunction with our GAAP financials, provide useful information to investors by facilitating: 
 the comparability of our on-going operating results over the periods presented; 
 the ability to identify trends in our underlying business; and 
 the comparison of our operating results against analyst financial models and operating results of other public companies that supplement their GAAP results with non-GAAP financial measures. 
 These non-GAAP financial measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with our results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP. Some of these limitations are: 
 adjusted EBITDA does not reflect income tax expense (benefit), which may change cash available to us; 
 adjusted EBITDA does not reflect interest income (expense), which may reduce cash available to us; 
 adjusted EBITDA excludes depreciation and amortization and, although these are non-cash charges, the property and equipment being depreciated and amortized often will have to be replaced in the future, and adjusted EBITDA does not reflect any cash capital expenditure requirements for such replacements; 
 adjusted EBITDA excludes the amortization of point of purchase (POP) display assets because it is a non-cash charge, and is treated similarly to depreciation of property and equipment and amortization of acquired intangible assets; 
 adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP net income (loss) exclude restructuring and other related costs which primarily include severance-related costs, stock-based compensation expenses, manufacturing consolidation charges, facilities consolidation charges recorded in connection with restructuring actions, including right-of-use asset impairment charges (if applicable), and the related ongoing operating lease cost of those facilities recorded under ASC 842, Leases . These expenses do not reflect expected future operating expenses and do not contribute to a meaningful evaluation of current operating performance or comparisons to the operating performance in other periods; 
 adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP net income (loss) exclude stock-based compensation expense related to equity awards granted primarily to our workforce. We exclude stock-based compensation expense because we believe that the non-GAAP financial measures excluding this item provide meaningful supplemental information regarding operational performance. In particular, we note that companies calculate stock-based compensation expense for the variety of award types that they employ using different valuation methodologies and subjective assumptions. These non-cash charges are not factored into our internal evaluation of non-GAAP net income (loss) as we believe their inclusion would hinder our ability to assess core operational performance; 
 adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP net income (loss) excludes any gain or loss on the extinguishment of debt because it is not reflective of ongoing operating results in the period, and the frequency and amount of such gains and losses vary; 
 42 

GoPro, Inc. 
 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

 non-GAAP net income (loss) excludes acquisition-related costs including the amortization of acquired intangible assets (primarily consisting of acquired technology), the impairment of acquired intangible assets (if applicable), as well as third-party transaction costs incurred for legal and other professional services. These costs are not factored into our evaluation of potential acquisitions, or of our performance after completion of the acquisitions because these costs are not related to our core operating performance or reflective of ongoing operating results in the period, and the frequency and amount of such costs vary significantly based on the timing and magnitude of our acquisition transactions and the maturities of the businesses being acquired. Although we exclude the amortization of acquired intangible assets from our non-GAAP net income (loss), management believes that it is important for investors to understand that such intangible assets were recorded as part of purchase accounting and can contribute to revenue generation; 
 non-GAAP net income (loss) excludes a gain on the sale and/or license of intellectual property. This gain is not related to our core operating performance or reflective of ongoing operating results in the period, and the frequency and amount of such gains are inconsistent; 
 non-GAAP net income (loss) includes income tax adjustments. In the first quarter of 2024, we revised our income tax adjustments to reflect the current and deferred income tax expense (benefit) and the effect of non-GAAP adjustments to better align with SEC guidance. For comparative purposes, we have revised the prior year income tax adjustments to reflect current and deferred income tax expense (benefit) and the effect of non-GAAP adjustments. Additionally, in the second quarter of 2024, we revised the first quarter of 2024 income tax adjustment to exclude the establishment of a valuation allowance on the United States federal and state deferred tax assets; 
 GAAP and non-GAAP net income (loss) per share includes the dilutive, tax effected cash interest expense associated with our 2025 Notes in periods of net income, as if converted at the beginning of the period; and 
 other companies may calculate these non-GAAP financial measures differently than we do, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures. 
 The following table presents a reconciliation of net loss to adjusted EBITDA:

Additionally, in the second quarter of 2024, we revised the first quarter of 2024 income tax adjustment to exclude the establishment of a valuation allowance on United States federal and state deferred tax assets.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
 We are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business. These risks primarily include foreign currency and interest rate risks as follows: 
 Foreign currency risk. Revenue generated from GoPro.com is denominated in U.S. dollars and various foreign currencies. Revenue generated from our international distributor and retail sales channels is generally priced in U.S. dollars, however we typically adjust our selling prices to reflect local exchange rate fluctuations. The strength of the U.S. dollar relative to other foreign currencies has negatively impacted revenue, gross margin and net income (loss) per share due to our sales outside of the United States by approximately 50 million in the last 12 months ending September 30, 2024 relative to 2021 foreign currency rates. To date, the majority of our inventory purchases have been denominated in our functional currency of the U.S. dollar. Our operations outside of the United States hold foreign denominated cash balances and incur a majority of their operating expenses in foreign currencies. We therefore have foreign currency risk related to these currencies, which are primarily the Australian dollar, Canadian dollar, Euro, Great British pound, Japanese yen and Romanian leu. Changes in exchange rates, and in particular, a weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar will negatively affect our revenue and operating income as expressed in U.S. dollars. 
 To date, we have not entered into any foreign currency exchange contracts or derivatives, and we will continue to reassess our approach to manage our risk relating to fluctuations in currency rates. The volatility of exchange rates depends on many factors that we cannot forecast with reliable accuracy. 
 Interest rate risk. Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates primarily relates to our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities. Our cash equivalents and marketable securities are comprised of money market funds, U.S. treasury securities, commercial paper, government securities and corporate debt securities. The primary objectives of our investment activities are to preserve principal and provide liquidity without significantly increasing risk. Our cash and cash equivalents are held for working capital purposes. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes. Due to the nature of our investment portfolio, we do not believe that an immediate 10 shift in interest rates would have a material effect on the fair value of our investment portfolio. 
 The fair value of our 2025 Convertible Senior Notes (2025 Notes) is subject to interest rate risk, market risk and other factors due to the conversion feature. The capped call that was entered into concurrently with the issuance of our 2025 Notes were completed to reduce the potential dilution from the conversion of the 2025 Notes. The fair value of the 2025 Notes will generally increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. In addition, the fair value of the 2025 Notes will generally increase as our Class A common stock price increases and will generally decrease as our Class A common stock price declines. The interest and market value changes affect the fair value of the 2025 Notes but do not impact our financial position, cash flows or results of operations due to the fixed nature of the debt obligation. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 The Company s management, with the participation of the Company s principal executive officer and principal financial officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures based on the criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act)), as of September 30, 2024. Based on such evaluation, the Company s principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the Company s reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms and is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 45 

There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by Rules 13a-15(d) and 15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act that occurred during the three months ended September 30, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 Refer to Legal proceedings and investigations included in Part I, Item 1. Note 10 Commitments, contingencies, and guarantees, to the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the three months ended September 30, 2024. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 The risks described in Risk Factors in our 2023 Annual Report, and as supplemented below, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. The risk factors below do not identify all risks that we face; our operations or financial condition could also be affected by factors that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial to our operations. In that event, the trading price of our shares may decline, and you may lose part or all of your investment. 
 Risk Factor Summary 
 We may not be able to achieve revenue growth or profitability in the future, and if revenue growth or profitability is achieved, we may not be able to sustain it. 
 Our ability to be profitable relies, in part, upon our ability to manage our cost structure and increase revenue, and we may not be successful in doing either. 
 We may not be able to acquire and retain subscribers at all or at historical rates, which could adversely impact our results of operations and our ability to be profitable. 
 To remain competitive and stimulate consumer demand, we must effectively manage product introductions, product transitions, product pricing and marketing. 
 Our restructuring and reduction in force undertaken to reduce our cost structure may not achieve our intended outcome. 
 Our future growth depends on further penetrating and expanding our total addressable market, and we may not be successful in doing so. 
 An economic downturn or economic uncertainty in the United States and international markets, as well as inflation, market volatility, fluctuations in interest rates or currency exchange rates, may adversely affect consumer spending, demand for our products and our ability to grow, which could impact our operating results or financial position. 
 If our sales fall below our forecasts, especially during the holiday season, our overall financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. 
 We rely on third-party suppliers, some of which are sole-source suppliers, to provide services and components for our products which may lead to supply shortages, long lead times for components, and supply changes, any of which could disrupt our supply chain or our operations and may increase our costs. 
 If we do not successfully coordinate or if we encounter issues with our manufacturers, suppliers, or supply chain, business, brand, and results of operations could be harmed and we could lose sales. 
 46 

We depend on sales of our cameras, mounts, and accessories for substantially all of our revenue, and any delays in the launch of our products or decrease in the sales or change in sales mix of our products could harm our business. 
 We face substantial risks related to inventory, purchase commitments, and long-lived assets, and we could incur material charges related to these items that adversely affect our operating results. 
 Security and data breaches and cyber-attacks could disrupt our web platform, products, services, internal operations, information technology systems, or those of our strategic partners, and any such disruption could reduce our expected revenue, increase our expenses, damage our reputation, and cause our stock price to decline significantly. 
 Our international operations account for a significant portion of our revenue and operating expenses and are subject to challenges and risks. Adverse developments in global economic or geopolitical conditions, or the occurrence of other world events, could materially adversely affect our revenue and results of operations. 
 We depend on key personnel and qualified personnel to operate our business. If we are unable to attract, engage and retain qualified personnel, our ability to develop, transform and successfully operate our business could be harmed. 
 Our gross margin can vary significantly depending on multiple factors, which can result in unanticipated fluctuations in our operating results. 
 We operate in a highly competitive market and the size and resources of some of our competitors may allow them to compete more effectively than we can. New entrants also enter the digital imaging market category from time-to-time. These market factors could result in a loss of our market share and a decrease in our revenue and profitability. 
 Adverse changes to trade agreements, trade policies, tariffs and import/export regulations may have a negative effect on our business and results of operations. 
 If we fail to manage our operating expenses effectively, our financial performance may suffer. 
 A small number of retailers and distributors account for a substantial portion of our revenue, and if our relationships with any of these retailers or distributors were to be terminated or the level of business with them significantly reduced, our business could be harmed. 
 Our success depends on our ability to maintain the value and reputation of our brand. 
 Consumers may be injured while engaging in activities with our products, and we may be exposed to claims, or regulations could be imposed, which could adversely affect our brand, operating results, and financial condition. 
 We may be subject to warranty claims that could result in significant direct or indirect costs, or we could experience greater returns from retailers and customers than expected, which could harm our business and operating results. 
 We may grow our business in part through acquisitions, joint ventures, investments, and partnerships, which could require significant management attention, disrupt our business, dilute stockholder value, and adversely affect our operating results. 
 We use artificial intelligence in our business, and its improper use or unintended consequences could adversely affect our reputation and our results of operations. 
 Catastrophic events or political instability could disrupt and cause harm to our business. 
 
 Risks related to our business and industry 
 47 

We may not be able to achieve revenue growth or profitability in the future, and if revenue growth or profitability is achieved, we may not be able to sustain it. 
 We have achieved GAAP income in prior years, however in the future, we may not be able to achieve our forecast, sustain revenue growth or profitability, and our operating results may fluctuate unpredictably. For example, our annual revenue decreased from 1.09 billion in 2022 to 1.01 billion in 2023, and our revenue decreased from 710.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 600.6 million in the same period for 2024. In addition, we incurred a net loss of 53.2 million for the full year of 2023 and earned net income of 28.8 million for the full year of 2022. In the near term, we expect sales and revenue to decline, and we may not be able to slow or reverse this trend. We may also be negatively impacted by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, which could have a material negative effect on our future operating results. 
 Lower levels of revenue, lower product margins or higher levels of operating expenses in future periods may result in losses or limited profitability. We may experience lower levels of revenue, lower product margins or higher levels of operating expenses for a variety of reasons, including, among other factors: ineffective investments in product innovation and development, including investments related to our recent acquisition of Forcite Helmet Systems; any delays or issues with our new product launches; increased advertising and marketing costs and/or ineffectiveness thereof; increasing freight rates; shipping delays; increased supply chain costs; impact of currency exchange rates; increased costs; lower average sales pricing for our cameras; or a recession or other sustained adverse market events that materially impacts consumer purchases of discretionary items, such as our products. For example, in 2023, our margins were negatively impacted by price protection charges, an increase in the volume of sales of our entry-level price point cameras, and a decrease to sales from GoPro.com. 
 We may continue to experience fluctuating revenue, expenses, and profitability for a number of reasons, including other risks described in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in our 2023 Annual Report, and we may encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, delays, and other unknown factors. 
 Our ability to be profitable relies, in part, upon our ability to manage our cost structure and increase revenue, and we may not be successful in doing either. 
 Our ability to be profitable relies, in part, on managing our cost structure and increasing revenue. We depend upon maintaining and developing effective sales channels between our retailers, distributors, and direct-to-consumer via GoPro.com. 
 We do not currently anticipate substantial growth in our revenue. Any reduction in sales by our retail and distribution channels could adversely affect our revenue, operating results, and financial condition. We depend on retailers to provide adequate and attractive space for our products and point-of-purchase (POP) displays in their stores and acquiesce to our policies. Some retailers have carried and displayed less inventory, as a result of macroeconomic factors, theft, or lack of available inventory at certain price points or in certain product categories, which has impacted sales. We further depend on our retailers to employ, educate, and motivate their sales personnel to effectively sell our products. If our retailers do not adequately display our products, choose to reduce the space for our products and POP displays in their stores or locate them in less than premium positioning, or choose not to carry some or all of our products or promote competitors products over ours or do not effectively explain to customers the advantages of our products, our sales could decrease and our business could be harmed. Increasing retail and distributor sales requires significant investment and resources. For example, we expect continued investment in new POP displays and updating existing POP displays for both existing stores and new retailers which we believe will attract, inform consumers, and assist sales personnel to effectively sell our products; however, there can be no assurance that this investment will lead to increased revenue and profit. 
 Our future growth also relies, in part, on our continued ability to attract consumers to our GoPro.com sales channel, which has and will require significant expenditures in marketing, software development and infrastructure. There can be no assurance that this investment will be successful. 
 We may not be able to acquire and retain subscribers at all or at historical rates, which could adversely impact our results of operations and our ability to be profitable. 
 We have experienced high growth in our subscribers over the past several years, but we may not be able to sustain such growth in the future. For example, our subscriber growth slowed to 2 from 11 when comparing 
 48 

subscriber count for the nine months ending on September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Our revenue growth and profitability are dependent on our ability to continuously attract and retain subscribers, and we cannot be certain that efforts to do so will be successful. Any changes to our subscription offerings, or increases to the offering costs, could have an adverse effect on the success and profitability of our subscription service, attracting new subscribers and retaining existing subscribers. There are many factors that could lead to slowing subscriber growth or a decline in subscribers, including a decline in camera sales, attach rates or retention rates, our failure to introduce new features, benefits, products, or services that customers desire, changes to existing products, services, and pricing that are not favorably received by our customers, or changes in the perceived value of our offerings. If the attach rate is less than what we forecasted, particularly the retail attach rate, this could have a negative impact on our overall subscriber growth plans. A decline in subscribers could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results. 
 To remain competitive and stimulate consumer demand, we must effectively manage product introductions, product transitions, product pricing and marketing. 
 We believe that we must continually develop and introduce new products on schedule, enhance our existing products, anticipate consumer preferences, and effectively stimulate consumer demand for new and upgraded products and services to maintain or increase our revenue. Our products and services are subject to changing consumer preferences that cannot be predicted with certainty and development lead times may make it more difficult for us to respond rapidly to new or changing consumer preferences. The markets for our products and services are characterized by intense competition, evolving distribution models, disruptive technology developments, short product life cycles, customer price sensitivity and frequent product introductions. 
 The success of new product introductions depends on a number of factors including, but not limited to, timely and successful research and development of next generation systems, pricing, market and consumer acceptance, the ability to successfully identify and originate product trends, effective forecasting and management of product demand, purchase commitments and inventory levels, availability of products in appropriate quantities to meet anticipated demand, ability to obtain timely and adequate delivery of components for our new products from third-party suppliers, management of any changes in major component suppliers, management of manufacturing and supply costs, management of risks and delays associated with new product design and production ramp-up issues, logistics, and the risk that new products may have quality issues or other defects or bugs in the early stages of introduction including testing of new parts and features. 
 Our research and development efforts are complex and require us to incur substantial expenses to support the development of our next generation cameras, tech-enabled helmets, software applications, and other products and services. In particular, our flagship camera designs incorporate custom system-on-chip (SoC), sensors, lens, batteries, and memory solutions that critically impact the performance of our products. Our research and development expenses were 165.7 million, 139.9 million, 141.5 million, and 131.6 million for 2023, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively, and we expect that our research and development expenses will continue to be substantial in 2024 as we develop innovative technologies. Unanticipated problems in developing products could divert substantial resources, which may impair our ability to develop new products and enhancements of existing products and could further increase our costs. We may not be able to achieve an acceptable return, if any, on our research and development efforts, and our business may be adversely affected. As we continually seek to enhance our products, we will incur additional costs to incorporate new or revised features. We might not be able to, or determine that it is not in our interests to, raise prices to compensate for any additional costs. 
 Additionally, as a result of the macroeconomic environment, we may not be able to accurately forecast consumer demand and inventory requirements and appropriately manage inventory to meet demand. For example, inflationary pressures may have an impact on consumers share of wallet or our ability to raise prices. We have, and may in the future, reduce prices to stimulate demand. We offer retroactive price protection to certain of our retailers and distributors. For example, as a result of our May 2023 price drop, we recorded a total price protection charge of 26.7 million in the six months ended June 30, 2023, based on estimated channel inventory levels. If price protection adjustments are higher than expected, our future results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, if we fail to meet any minimum commitments under agreements with our contract manufacturers, we may be required to pay the difference or to pay in advance for additional components, and our results of operations could be negatively impacted. With respect to management and supply costs, we may be 
 49 

impacted by heightened demand for specialty memory, components and batteries that are not supported by our manufacturing partners. Such supply shortages may affect our ability to manage appropriate supply levels of our products and pricing pressures may negatively affect our gross margins. 
 In addition, the introduction or announcement of new products or product enhancements may shorten the life cycle of our existing products or reduce demand for our current products, thereby offsetting any benefits of successful product introductions and potentially lead to challenges in managing inventory of existing products. 
 Additionally, our brand and product marketing efforts are critical to stimulating consumer demand. We market our products globally through a range of advertising and promotional programs and campaigns, including social media. If we do not successfully market our products or invest sufficient resources in marketing our products, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could suffer as a result. 
 Our restructuring and reduction in force undertaken to reduce our cost structure may not achieve our intended outcome. 
 We previously implemented company-wide restructurings of our business, including in March 2024, August 2024 and October 2024, resulting in a reduction in our global workforce, the elimination of certain open positions and reduction of certain office space, as well as the elimination of several high-cost initiatives, in order to optimize our cost structure and focus our resources on cameras, accessories, subscription and service, and tech-enabled helmets. These reductions in force may result in unintended consequences and costs, such as the loss of institutional knowledge and expertise, attrition beyond the intended number of employees, decreased morale among our remaining employees, and the risk that we may not achieve the anticipated benefits of the reduction in force. In addition, while positions have been eliminated, certain functions necessary to our operations remain, and we may be unsuccessful in distributing the duties and obligations of departed employees among our remaining employees. The reduction in workforce could also make it difficult for us to pursue, or prevent us from pursuing, new opportunities and initiatives due to insufficient personnel, or require us to incur additional and unanticipated costs to hire new personnel to pursue such opportunities or initiatives. If we are unable to realize the anticipated benefits from the reductions in force, or if we experience significant adverse consequences from the reductions in force, our business, financial condition, and results of operations may be materially adversely affected. We may undertake further similar cost-saving initiatives, which may include additional restructuring or workforce reductions. These types of cost-reduction activities can be complex and result in unintended consequences and costs, including further attrition beyond the intended number of employees due to decreased employee morale, loss of institutional knowledge and expertise and adversely impact our business. 
 Our future growth depends on further penetrating and expanding our total addressable market, and we may not be successful in doing so. 
 Historically, the majority of our growth has been fueled by the adoption of our HERO and MAX 360-degree camera products, extensive mount and accessory ecosystem, and subscription products by people looking to self-capture images of themselves participating in exciting physical activities and helping those people create and share compelling and meaningful content with friends, family and followers. We believe that our future growth depends on continuing to add versatility to our products and reach and expand our core community of customers of our products and services, followers, and fans, and then utilizing that energized community as brand ambassadors to an extended community. Despite this, we may not be successful in further penetrating or expanding our existing market. 
 We may not be able to expand our subscription and service offerings and cannot be certain that these efforts will be successful, and as a result, we may not be able to increase our total addressable market, revenue, or operating profit. We may not be able to expand our market, revenue and gross margin through this strategy on a timely basis, or at all, or recognize the benefits of our investments in this strategy, and we may not be successful in providing tools that our users adopt or believe are easy to use, which will negatively affect our future growth. 
 Our growth also depends on expanding into new markets with new capture perspectives, including with tech-enabled helmets currently in development. We cannot be assured that we will be successful in expanding into markets with new capture perspectives. New markets that we attempt to enter may be highly competitive, and we may have limited experience in those emerging markets. If we are not successful in expanding into additional 
 50 

markets, and enabling new capture perspectives, we might not be able to grow our revenue and we may not recognize benefits from our investment in new areas. 
 An economic downturn or economic uncertainty in the United States and international markets, as well as inflation, market volatility, fluctuations in interest rates or currency exchange rates, may adversely affect consumer spending, demand for our products and our ability to grow, which could impact our operating results or financial position. 
 Factors affecting the level of consumer spending include general market and macroeconomic conditions, domestic and international political conditions, regional conflicts, tax rates, inflation, tariffs, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and interest rates, potential recessions, and other factors such as consumer confidence, the availability and cost of consumer credit, levels of unemployment and a reduction in consumer spending or discretionary income that may affect us more significantly than companies in other industries and companies with more diversified products. For example, if any of the current regional conflicts around the world were to escalate or expand, it could lead to disruption of our supply chain and have a negative impact on consumer discretionary spending. 
 The majority of our sales occur in United States dollars (U.S. dollar). An increase or decrease in the value of the U.S. dollar against the Euro and other foreign currencies could impact sales of our products, which could have a material impact on our operating results. For example, a strengthening U.S. dollar relative to other currencies could increase the real cost to consumers of our products in those markets outside the United States, which could lower sales and/or cause us to reduce our selling price to retailers and distributors in those markets. If global economic conditions are volatile or deteriorate, consumers may delay or reduce purchases of our products resulting in lower consumer demand for our products such that we may not reach our sales targets. Some product costs have become subject to inflationary pressure, and we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs through price increases; our inability or failure to offset any such higher costs as necessary could harm our business, financial condition, and operating results. 
 Moreover, adverse developments that affect financial institutions, such as events involving liquidity that are rumored or actual, have in the past and may in the future lead to market-wide liquidity problems. Any future adverse developments in the global banking system could directly or indirectly negatively impact our results of operations. Deterioration in economic conditions in the United States or international markets in which we do business could also cause slower or impaired collections on accounts receivable, which may adversely impact our liquidity and financial condition. 
 If our sales fall below our forecasts, especially during the holiday season, our overall financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. 
 Seasonal consumer shopping patterns significantly affect our business. We have traditionally experienced greater revenue in the fourth quarter of each year due to demand related to the holiday season, and in some years, including 2023, greater demand associated with the launch of new products heading into the holiday season. Fourth quarter revenue comprised 29 , 29 , and 34 of our 2023, 2022, and 2021 revenue, respectively. Given the strong seasonal nature of our sales, appropriate forecasting is critical to our operations. We anticipate that this seasonal impact is likely to continue and any shortfalls in expected fourth quarter revenue due to macroeconomic conditions, the inflationary impact on consumers share of wallet, product release patterns or delays, declines in the effectiveness of our promotional activities, changes in product mix, charges incurred against new products to support promotional activities for such new products, pricing pressures, supply chain disruptions, shipping delays, or for any other reason, could cause our annual results of operations to suffer significantly. For example, during the fourth quarter of 2023, our sell-through fell short of our projections partially due to consumers expectation of holiday season promotions even after the Thanksgiving Black Friday events. In addition, in the U.S. market, consumer spending shifted away from consumer electronics products in the month of December further impacting our results of operation. 
 In addition, we typically experience lower revenue in the first half of the year as a percentage of total revenue for the year, as compared to second half revenue. First half revenue comprised 41 , 43 , and 39 of our annual 2023, 2022, and 2021 revenue, respectively. 
 51 

We rely on third-party suppliers, some of which are sole-source suppliers, to provide services and components for our products which may lead to supply shortages, long lead times for components, and supply changes, any of which could disrupt our supply chain or our operations and may increase our costs. 
 Our ability to meet customer demand depends, in part, on our ability to obtain timely and adequate delivery of components for our products. We do not have internal manufacturing capabilities and rely on several contract manufacturers, located in China and Thailand, to manufacture our products. All of the components that go into the manufacturing of our hardware products and accessories are sourced from third-party suppliers. We do not control our contract manufacturers or suppliers, including their capacity, bandwidth, or costs of their labor, environmental or other practices. 
 Some of the key components used to manufacture our products come from a limited or single source of supply, or by a supplier that could potentially become a competitor. Our contract manufacturers generally purchase these components on our behalf from approved suppliers. We are subject to the risk of shortages and long lead times in the supply of these components and the risk that our suppliers discontinue or modify components used in our products. In addition, the lead times associated with certain components are lengthy and preclude rapid changes in quantities and delivery schedules, and such lead times could increase as a result of shipping disruptions, global conflicts, including any escalations or expansions of those conflicts, or other factors. We have in the past experienced and may in the future experience component shortages, and the availability of these components may be unpredictable, including as a result of global conflict and pandemics. 
 If we lose access to components from a particular supplier or experience a significant disruption in the supply of products and components from a current supplier, we may be unable to locate alternative suppliers or submit orders directly through supplier s vendors of comparable quality at an acceptable price, or at all, and our business could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, if we experience a significant increase in demand for our products, our suppliers might not have the capacity or elect not to meet our needs as they allocate components to other customers. Developing suitable alternate sources of supply for these components may be time-consuming, difficult and costly, and we may not be able to source these components on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all, which may adversely affect our ability to meet our development requirements or to fill our orders in a timely or cost-effective manner. 
 We also rely on third-party distribution facilities and logistics operators for substantially all of our product distribution to distributors, retailers, and to consumers. In some instances, we bear the risk of loss, theft, or damage of our products in transit, and our insurance may be insufficient to cover all risk of loss, theft, or damage of our products. Our distribution facilities include computer controlled and automated equipment, which means their operations may be vulnerable to computer viruses or other security risks, the proper operation of software and hardware, electronic or power interruptions or other system failures. 
 Our reliance on single source, or a small number of suppliers, involves a number of additional risks, including risks related to supplier capacity constraints, component availability, price increases, timely delivery, component quality, failure of a key supplier to remain in business and adjust to market conditions, delays in, or the inability to execute on, a supplier roadmap for components and technologies, and natural disasters, fire, acts of terrorism, global conflicts, pandemics or other catastrophic events. 
 An actual or perceived downgrade in our liquidity or operations could cause our suppliers or contract manufacturers to change credit terms, limit the extension of credit, or otherwise materially modify their payment terms or allocation of resources to us. Any material changes in our payment terms, availability of credit provided by our suppliers, or availability of supplier capacity or components could impact our liquidity, results of operations, and financial condition. 
 In particular, for our camera designs we incorporate system on chips, sensors, lens, batteries and memory solutions that critically impact the performance of our products. These components have unique design and performance profiles, and as a result, it is not commercially practical to support multiple sources for these components for our products. For example, we incorporate the GP2 system on chip in our HERO12 Black camera, and other cameras. We rely on a single source for GP2 and are subject to price increases for those 
 52 

components. Costs for the components that comprise GP2 could continue to increase even as prices for commodity components decline. 
 Additionally, we rely on third parties to provide software and enterprise services. For example, we host our software applications and firmware upgrades for our cameras using Amazon Web Services (AWS). A prolonged AWS service disruption affecting our subscription products would negatively impact our ability to serve our consumers and could damage our reputation with current and potential consumers, expose us to liability, cause us to lose consumers, or otherwise harm our business. In the event that our AWS service agreements are terminated, or there is a lapse of service, elimination of AWS services or features that we use, interruption of internet service provider connectivity, or damage to such facilities, we could experience interruptions in access to our subscription offerings as well as significant delays and additional expense in arranging or creating new facilities and services and/or re-architecting our solutions for deployment on a different cloud infrastructure service provider, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
 If we do not successfully coordinate or if we encounter issues with our manufacturers, suppliers, or supply chain, business, brand, and results of operations could be harmed and we could lose sales. 
 Our business requires us to coordinate the manufacture and distribution of our products. Our manufacturers and supply chain partners may experience disruptions in their operations due to equipment breakdowns, component or material shortages, labor strikes or shortages, shipping delays, transportation or logistics challenges, natural disasters, cyber-attacks or other cybersecurity incidents, cost increases, pandemics, or other similar problems. If we do not successfully coordinate with our service providers, we may have insufficient supply of products to meet customer demand or face increased or additional costs, and as a result, we could lose sales, and our financial performance may be adversely affected. 
 The effect of seasonal demand fluctuations on supply chains, transportation costs, fuel costs, labor unrest, natural disasters, global conflicts, regional or global pandemics, and other adverse effects on our ability, timing and cost of delivering products can increase our inventory, decrease our margins, adversely affect our relations with distributors and other customers and otherwise adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. 
 Environmental regulations or changes in the supply, demand or available sources of natural resources may affect the availability and cost of goods and services necessary to run our business. We require our contract manufacturers and suppliers to comply with our formal supplier code of conduct and relevant standards and periodically conduct audits of our contract manufacturers and suppliers compliance with our code of conduct, applicable laws and good industry practices. However, these audits may not be frequent or thorough enough to detect non-compliance. Deliberate violations of labor, environmental or other laws by our contract manufacturers or suppliers, or a failure of these parties to follow ethical business practices, could lead to negative publicity and harm our reputation or brand. 
 As a company engaged in manufacturing and distribution, we are subject to the risks inherent in such activities, including disruptions or delays in supply chain. For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic and as a result of governmental responses to the COVID-19 pandemic among other macroeconomic factors, certain of our suppliers and manufacturers experienced disruptions, resulting in supply shortages and costs increases, staffing shortages, manufacturing facility closures, and similar disruptions could occur in the future. Any increases in the costs of goods and services for our business may also adversely affect our profit margins particularly if we are unable to achieve higher price increases or otherwise increase cost or operational efficiencies to offset the higher costs. 
 We depend on sales of our cameras, mounts, and accessories for substantially all of our revenue, and any delays in the launch of our products or decrease in the sales or change in sales mix of our products could harm our business. 
 We expect to derive the majority of our revenue from sales of cameras, mounts, and accessories for the foreseeable future and an increasing amount of revenue attributable from our subscription and service. A decline in the price or unit demand for these products, whether due to a shift in our sales channel strategy, or macroeconomic conditions, including variable tariff rates, competition or otherwise, or our inability to increase sales of higher price point products, would harm our business and operating results more seriously than it would if we derived significant revenue from a variety of product lines and services. In particular, a decline in the price or 
 53 

unit demand of our HERO camera line, MAX camera line, and other product lines, or our inability to increase sales of these products, could materially harm our business and operating results. 
 Further, any delays or issues with our new product launches, including the delayed launch of our next generation 360-degree camera from 2024 to 2025, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 
 We face substantial risks related to inventory, purchase commitments, and long-lived assets, and we could incur material charges related to these items that adversely affect our operating results. 
 To ensure adequate inventory supply and meet the demands of our retailers and distributors, we must forecast inventory needs and place orders with our contract manufacturers and component suppliers based on our estimates of future demand for particular products as well as accurately track the level of product inventory in the channel to ensure we are not in an over or under supply situation. To the extent we discontinue the manufacturing and sales of any products or services, we must manage the inventory liquidation, supplier commitments and customer expectations. 
 No assurance can be given that we will not incur additional charges in future periods related to our inventory management or that we will accurately forecast sales in a future period. Our ability to accurately forecast demand for our products is affected by many factors, including product introductions by us and our competitors, channel inventory levels, unanticipated changes in general market demand, macroeconomic conditions, including inflation or recession, and consumer confidence. If we do not accurately forecast customer demand for our products, we may in future periods be unable to meet consumer, retailer, or distributor demand for our products, or may be required to incur higher costs to secure the necessary production capacity and components, and our business and operating results could be adversely affected. 
 Security and data breaches and cyber-attacks could disrupt our web platform, products, services, internal operations, information technology systems, or those of our strategic partners, and any such disruption could reduce our expected revenue, increase our expenses, damage our reputation, and cause our stock price to decline significantly. 
 We are dependent on information systems to develop our products and services, process transactions, manage our supply chain and inventory, ship goods on a timely basis, maintain cost-efficient operations, complete timely and accurate financial reporting, operate GoPro.com, and respond to customer inquiries. Cyber-attacks may threaten our information systems and are increasing in their frequency, sophistication, and maleficence, and have become increasingly difficult to detect. As artificial intelligence capabilities improve and are increasingly adopted, we may see cyber-attacks utilizing or exploiting artificial intelligence. Despite the implementation of security measures designed to protect against such threats, our information technology systems, and those of our strategic partners and third parties on whom we rely, are vulnerable to cyber-attacks, security breaches, computer viruses damage, unauthorized access, natural disasters, terrorism, theft or exposure of confidential data, war and other acts of foreign governments, and failures of telecommunication, electrical and other critical systems. 
 Our products, services and operating systems may contain unknown security vulnerabilities. For example, the firmware and software that are installed on our products may be susceptible to hacking or misuse, or we may experience disruptions to our GoPro.com platform. If malicious actors compromise our products and services, including without limitation hacking or breach of such products and services, our business and our reputation will be harmed. 
 In the ordinary course of our business, we electronically collect, use and store sensitive data, including our intellectual property, our proprietary business information and that of our customers and suppliers, and personally identifiable information of our customers and employees. We collect, use and store user data uploaded by users through the GoPro cloud, mobile and desktop apps and through certain marketing activities. For all of the foregoing, we collect, use and store that information in our or our third-party providers systems. These systems may be targets of attacks, malware, viruses or phishing attempts by cyber criminals or other wrongdoers seeking to steal our users content or data, or our customers information for financial gain or to harm our business operations or reputation. 
 54 

Any security breach, unauthorized access or usage, or similar breach or disruption of our systems, or the systems of third parties on which we rely including web hosting services, billing and payment processing, or software could result in a disruption to our business or the loss of confidential information, costly investigations, remediation efforts and costly notification to affected consumers. If such content were accessed by unauthorized third parties or deleted inadvertently by us or third parties, our brand and reputation could be adversely affected. Cyber-attacks could also adversely affect our operating results, consume internal resources and result in litigation or potential liability for us and otherwise harm our business and our reputation. 
 While we maintain industry standard cybersecurity insurance, our insurance may be insufficient for a particular incident or may not cover all liabilities incurred by any such attacks. We also cannot be certain that our insurance coverage will be adequate for data handling or data security liabilities actually incurred, that insurance will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms, or at all, or that any insurer will not deny coverage as to any future claim. The successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceed available insurance coverage, litigation to pursue claims under our insurance policies or the occurrence of changes in our insurance policies, including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or co-insurance requirements, or denials of coverage, could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, operating results and financial condition. Moreover, many of our employees, service providers and third parties work more frequently on a remote or hybrid arrangement basis, which may also result in heightened risks related to consumer privacy, network security and fraud. System disruptions, failures, and slowdowns, whether caused by cyber-attacks, update failures or other causes, could affect our financial systems and operations. This could cause delays in our supply chain or cause information, including data related to customer orders, to be lost or delayed which could result in delays in the delivery of merchandise to our stores and to customers, or lost sales, especially if the disruption or slowdown occurred during our quarters of peak demand. 
 Our international operations account for a significant portion of our revenue and operating expenses and are subject to challenges and risks. Adverse developments in global economic or geopolitical conditions, or the occurrence of other world events, could materially adversely affect our revenue and results of operations. 
 Revenue from outside the United States comprised 61 , 59 , and 55 of our revenue in 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively, and we expect international revenue to continue to be significant in the future. Further, we currently have foreign operations in Australia, China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, Netherlands, Philippines, Romania, the United Kingdom (U.K.) and a number of other countries in Europe and Asia. Operating in foreign countries requires significant resources and considerable management attention, and we may enter new geographic markets where we have limited or no experience in marketing, selling, and deploying our products. International expansion has required and will continue to require us to invest significant funds and other resources and we cannot be assured our efforts will be successful. International sales and operations may be subject to risks such as: 
 difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations, including management of overseas bank accounts and other operational risks; 
 burdens of complying with a wide variety of laws and regulations or risk of non-compliance, including environmental, packaging and labeling laws or regulations, which can change based on new political conditions; 
 delays or disruptions in our supply chain; 
 adverse tax effects and foreign exchange controls making it difficult to repatriate earnings and cash; 
 changes to the taxation of undistributed foreign earnings; 
 the effect of foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, including any fluctuations caused by, inflation, recessionary concerns, or the strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to the foreign currencies in which we conduct business; 
 political conditions, economic instability, geopolitical turmoil, civil disturbances, or social unrest in a specific country or region in which we operate, which could have an adverse impact on our operations in that location, for example, the effects of China-Taiwan relations or conflict in the Middle East; 
 55 

organized crime activity; 
 terrorist activities, acts of war, natural disasters, and pandemics; 
 wars and global conflicts, including the ongoing conflicts around the world; 
 quarantines or other disruptions to our operations resulting from pandemics or other widespread public health problems; 
 trade restrictions; 
 the effects of climate change; 
 differing employment practices and laws and labor disruptions; 
 the imposition of government controls; 
 lesser degrees of intellectual property protection; 
 tariffs and customs duties and the classifications of our goods by applicable governmental bodies; 
 political instability, including the occurrence of a temporary federal government shutdown; 
 a legal system subject to undue influence or corruption; and 
 a business culture in which illegal sales practices may be prevalent. 
 The occurrence of any of these risks could negatively affect our international business and consequently our business, operating results, and financial condition. 
 We depend on key personnel and qualified personnel to operate our business. If we are unable to attract, engage and retain qualified personnel, our ability to develop, transform and successfully operate our business could be harmed. 
 We believe that our future success is highly dependent on the contributions of our CEO, our executive officers, and our employees, as well as our ability to attract and retain highly skilled and experienced research and development and other personnel in the United States and abroad. All of our employees, including our executive officers, are free to terminate their employment relationship with us at any time, and their knowledge of our business and industry may be difficult to replace. If key employees leave, we may not be able to fully integrate new personnel or replicate the prior working relationships, and our operations could suffer as a result. 
 Qualified individuals are in high demand, and we may incur significant costs to attract and retain them, including circumstances beyond our control such as increased wages due to inflation, increasing competition among employers in the prevailing labor market, and labor market constraints. We have limited control over these factors. Competition for qualified personnel globally is challenging. In particular, we compete with many other companies for skilled positions, and we may not be successful in attracting and retaining the professionals we need. While we utilize competitive salary, bonus, and long-term incentive packages to recruit new employees, many of the companies with which we compete for experienced personnel may have greater resources to do so. 
 We have from time to time experienced, and we expect to continue to experience, difficulty in hiring and retaining highly skilled employees with appropriate qualifications. 
 Further, job candidates and existing employees often consider the value of the equity awards they receive in connection with their employment. Fluctuations in the price of our Class A common stock may make it more difficult or costly to use equity compensation to motivate, incentivize and retain our employees. For example, s ince 2023, our closing stock price ranged from a high of 6.46 in the first quarter of 2023 to a low of 1.16 in the third quarter of 2024. If we are unable to attract and retain highly skilled personnel, we may not be able to achieve our strategic objectives, and our business, financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected. 
 Our gross margin can vary significantly depending on multiple factors, which can result in unanticipated fluctuations in our operating results. 
 Our gross margin can vary due to consumer demand, competition, product pricing, promotional activities, product lifecycle, product mix, new product introductions, GoPro.com sales mix, subscription activation, renewals, and 
 56 

cancellations, commodity costs, supply chain, logistics costs and shipping costs, currency exchange rates, trade policy and tariffs, and the complexity and functionality of new product innovations and other factors. For example, our gross margin was 32.2 , 37.2 , and 41.1 for 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. In particular, if we are not able to introduce new products in a timely manner at the product cost we expect, if consumer demand for our products is less than we anticipate, if cancellation rates for our subscription offerings are higher than expected or if there are product pricing, marketing and other initiatives by our competitors to which we need to react or that are initiated by us to drive sales that lower our margins, then our overall gross margin will be less than we project. 
 As we innovate with new products, we may have lower gross margins that do not deliver a sufficient return on investment. In addition, depending on competition or consumer preferences, we may face higher up-front investments in development to compete or market our products, and increased inventory write-offs. If we are unable to offset these potentially lower margins by enhancing the margins in our product categories, our profitability may be adversely affected. 
 The impact of these factors on gross margin can create unanticipated fluctuations in our operating results, which may cause volatility in the price of our shares and as a result, harm our liquidity, limit our ability to grow our business, pursue acquisitions, and restrict our ability to compete in our markets. 
 We operate in a highly competitive market and the size and resources of some of our competitors may allow them to compete more effectively than we can. New entrants also enter the digital imaging market category from time-to-time. These market factors could result in a loss of our market share and a decrease in our revenue and profitability. 
 The digital imaging market is highly competitive. Further, competition has intensified in digital imaging as new market entrants and existing competitors have introduced new products and more competitive offerings into our markets. Increased competition, tariffs, and changing consumer preferences may result in pricing pressures, reduced profit margins and may impede our ability to continue to increase the sales of our products or cause us to lose market share, any of which could substantially harm our business and results of operations. 
 We compete against established, well-known camera manufacturers such as Canon Inc. and Nikon Corporation, as well as large, diversified electronics companies such as Samsung Electronics Co. and Sony Corporation, and specialty companies such as Garmin Ltd., the Ricoh Company, Ltd., Arashi Vision Inc. (Insta360), and SZ DJI Technology Co., Ltd. Many of our competitors have substantial market share, diversified product lines, well-established supply and distribution systems, strong worldwide brand recognition and greater financial, marketing, research and development and other resources than we do. Additionally, many of our existing and potential competitors enjoy substantial competitive advantages, such as longer operating histories, the capacity to leverage their sales efforts and marketing expenditures across a broader portfolio of products, broader distribution and established relationships with channel partners or vertically integrated business units, access to larger established customer bases, greater resources to make acquisitions, larger intellectual property portfolios, and the ability to bundle competitive offerings with other products and services. Further, new companies may emerge and offer competitive products directly in our category. Certain companies have developed cameras designed and packaged to appear similar to our products, which may confuse consumers or distract consumers from purchasing GoPro products. 
 Moreover, smartphones and tablets with photo and video functionality have significantly displaced the market for traditional cameras, and the makers of those devices also have mobile and other content editing applications and storage for content captured with those d evices. Our desktop and mobile apps, and subscription offerings may not be as compelling as those offered by other companies, such as Apple, Adobe, or Google, although the mobile application supports content from other platforms including content from iOS and Android. Manufacturers of smartphones and tablets, such as Apple, Google, and Samsung, may continue to design their products for use in a range of conditions similar to our products, including in challenging physical environments and with waterproof capabilities, or develop products with features similar to ours. We rely in part on application marketplaces, such as the Apple App Store and Google Play, to distribute our mobile and desktop apps. Apple and Google may raise commissions, change or modify rules or functionality for apps on the marketplaces, or make access to our apps more difficult, which could adversely impact our business and results of operations. 
 57 

Adverse changes to trade agreements, trade policies, tariffs and import/export regulations may have a negative effect on our business and results of operations. 
 The United States and other countries in which our products are produced or sold internationally have imposed and may impose additional quotas, duties, tariffs, or other restrictions or regulations, or may adversely adjust prevailing quota, duty, tariff levels, or export or other licensing requirements. Countries impose, modify and remove tariffs and other trade restrictions in response to a diverse array of factors, including global and national economic and political conditions, which make it impossible for us to predict future developments regarding tariffs and other trade restrictions. Trade restrictions, including tariffs, quotas, embargoes, safeguards, and customs restrictions, could increase the cost or reduce the supply of products, including components and materials, available to us or may require us to modify our supply chain organization or other current business practices, any of which could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. We are dependent on international trade agreements and regulations. If the United States were to withdraw from or materially modify certain international trade agreements, our business and operating results could be materially and adversely affected. 
 We do not have internal manufacturing capabilities and rely on several contract manufacturers, including component vendors, located in China, Thailand and in other countries to manufacture our products. Our contract manufacturer locations expose us to risks associated with doing business globally, including risks related to changes in tariffs or other export and import restrictions, and increased security costs. Additionally, the current United States administration continues to signal that it may continue to alter global trade agreements and terms. For example, the United States imposed additional tariffs on imports from China and continues to potentially impose other restrictions on exports from China to the United States. Any announcement by the United States Trade Representative (USTR) to impose tariffs on GoPro products could have a material adverse effect on our United States bound production, business, and results of our United States operations. If these duties are imposed on our products, we may be required to raise our prices, which may result in the loss of customers and harm our business and results of operations, or we may choose to pay for these tariffs without raising prices which may negatively impact our results of operations and profitability. Sales of our products in China are material to our business and represent a significant portion of our revenue. This revenue stream from China is at risk in the event China imposes retaliatory tariffs impacting in-bound sales of our products or imposes any other export restrictions on our products. 
 We continue to monitor manufacturing capabilities outside of China and currently manufacture certain cameras in Thailand to mitigate risks of additional tariffs, duties or other restrictions on our products destined for the United States and may choose to transition more manufacturing outside of China. 
 If we fail to manage our operating expenses effectively, our financial performance may suffer. 
 Our success will depend in part upon our ability to effectively manage our operating expenses, including but not limited to, our cash management. We incurred an operating loss in 2023, and we generated operating income for the full year of 2022 and 2021. As of September 30, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of 644.4 million. We have implemented global reductions-in-force and other restructuring actions to reduce our operating expenses. However, we may not realize the cost savings expected from our cost reduction actions. 
 We will need to continue to maintain and improve our operational, financial and management controls, reporting processes and procedures, and financial and business information systems. We are also investing in areas we believe will grow revenue and our operating expenses might increase as a result of these investments. If we are unable to operate efficiently and manage our costs, we may continue to incur significant losses in the future and may not be able to maintain or achieve profitability. 
 A small number of retailers and distributors account for a substantial portion of our revenue, and if our relationships with any of these retailers or distributors were to be terminated or the level of business with them significantly reduced, our business could be harmed. 
 Our ten largest third-party customers, measured by the revenue we derive from them, accounted for 44 , 41 and 46 of our revenue in 2023, 2022, and 2021 respectively. One retailer accounted for 10 , 8 and 11 of our revenue for 2023, 2022, and 2021 respectively. The loss of a small number of our large customers, or the reduction in business with one or more of our large customers, could have a significant adverse effect on our 
 58 

operating results. In addition, we may choose to temporarily or permanently stop shipping product to customers who do not follow the policies and guidelines in our sales agreements, which could have a material negative effect on our revenues and operating results. Our sales agreements with these large customers do not require them to purchase any meaningful amount of our products annually and we grant limited rights to return product to some of these large customers. 
 Our success depends on our ability to maintain the value and reputation of our brand. 
 Our success depends on the value and reputation of our brand, including our primary trademarks GOPRO, HERO, and the GoPro logos. The GoPro brand is integral to the growth of our business and expansion into new markets. Maintaining, promoting and positioning our brand will largely depend on the success of our marketing and merchandising efforts, including through establishing relationships with high profile sporting and entertainment events, venues, sports leagues and sports associations, athletes and celebrity personalities, our ability to provide consistent, high quality products and services, and our consumers satisfaction with the technical support and software updates we provide, each of which requires significant expenditures. Failure to grow and maintain our brand, launch new products on schedule and free of defects or negative publicity related to our products, our consumers user-generated content, the athletes we sponsor, the celebrities we are associated with, or the labor policies of any of our suppliers or manufacturers could adversely affect our brand, business and operating results. Maintaining and enhancing our brand also requires substantial financial investments, although there is no guarantee that these investments will increase sales of our products or positively affect our operating results. 
 Consumers may be injured while engaging in activities with our products, and we may be exposed to claims, or regulations could be imposed, which could adversely affect our brand, operating results, and financial condition. 
 Consumers use our cameras, mounts, and accessories to self-capture their participation in a wide variety of physical activities, including extreme sports, which in many cases carry the risk of significant injury or death. We may be subject to claims that users have been injured or harmed while using our products, including false claims or erroneous reports relating to safety, security, property damage or privacy issues. Although we maintain insurance to help protect us from the risk of such claims, such insurance may not be sufficient or may not apply to all situations. Similarly, governing sports bodies or proprietors of establishments at which consumers engage in challenging physical activities could seek to ban the use of our products in their events or facilities. For example, in some jurisdictions the mounting of our products on helmets is banned during competitive motorcycle events. In addition, if lawmakers or governmental agencies were to determine that the use of our products increased the risk of injury or harm to all or a subset of our users or should otherwise be restricted to protect consumers, they may pass laws or adopt regulations that limit the use of our products or increase our liability associated with the use of our products. Any of these events could adversely affect our brand, operating results, and financial condition. 
 We may be subject to warranty claims that could result in significant direct or indirect costs, or we could experience greater returns from retailers and customers than expected, which could harm our business and operating results. 
 We generally provide a 12-month warranty on all of our cameras, except in the European Union (the EU), where we provide a two-year warranty. For certain mounts and accessories, where permitted, we provide a lifetime or limited lifetime warranty. The occurrence of any material defects in our products could make us liable for damages and warranty claims in excess of our current reserves. In addition, we could incur significant costs to correct any defects, warranty claims or other problems, including costs related to product recalls. Any negative publicity related to the perceived quality and safety of our products could affect our brand image, decrease retailer, distributor and consumer confidence and demand, and adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. Additionally, if defects are not discovered until after consumers purchase our products, they could lose confidence in the technical attributes of our products and our business could be harmed. Also, while our warranty is limited to repairs or returns and replacement, warranty claims may result in litigation, the occurrence of which could adversely affect our business and operating results. Based on our historical experience with our camera products, we have an established methodology for estimating warranty liabilities with respect to cameras and accessories; however, this methodology may not accurately predict future rates of warranty claims. 
 59 

We may grow our business in part through acquisitions, joint ventures, investments, and partnerships, which could require significant management attention, disrupt our business, dilute stockholder value, and adversely affect our operating results. 
 We have completed several acquisitions, and recently acquired Forcite Helmet Systems, an Australian-based company that offers tech-enables helmets. We may evaluate additional acquisitions, partnerships, or joint ventures with, or strategic investments in, other companies, products or technologies that we believe are complementary to our business. Negotiating these transactions can be time-consuming, difficult, and expensive, and our ability to close these transactions may be subject to third-party or government approvals, which are beyond our control. Consequently, we can make no assurance that these transactions, once undertaken and announced, will close. 
 If we do complete acquisitions, we may not ultimately strengthen our competitive position or achieve our goals, and any acquisitions we complete could be viewed negatively by users or investors. In addition, if we encounter difficulties assimilating or integrating the businesses, technologies, products, personnel, or operations of acquired companies, particularly if the key personnel of the acquired business choose not to work for us, or we have difficulty retaining the customers of any acquired business, the revenue and operating results of the combined company could be adversely affected. Acquisitions may disrupt our ongoing operations, divert management from their primary responsibilities, subject us to additional liabilities, increase our expenses and adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, and cash flows. In addition, our original estimates and assumptions used in assessing any transaction may be inaccurate, including estimates of accounting charges. We have recorded significant goodwill and intangible assets in connection with our acquisitions, and in the future, if our acquisitions do not yield expected revenue, or if other factors negatively impact the fair value of our recorded goodwill or intangible assets, we may be required to take material non-cash impairment charges that could adversely affect our results of operations. 
 We may have to pay cash, incur debt, or issue equity securities to enter into any such acquisition, joint venture, strategic alliances or partnership, which could affect our financial condition or the value of our capital stock. Furthermore, acquisitions may require large one-time charges and can result in increased debt or contingent liabilities, adverse tax consequences, additional stock-based compensation expense and the recording and subsequent amortization or impairments of amounts related to certain purchased intangible assets, any of which could negatively affect our future results of operations. We cannot assure investors that the anticipated benefits of any acquisition or investment will be realized. 
 We review goodwill for impairment at least annually or more frequently if indicators of impairment arise, and should market conditions or macroeconomic conditions continue to deteriorate, including a rise in inflationary pressures and inte rest rates, a sustained decline in our share price, or a decline in our results of operations, the result of such review may indicate a decline in the fair value of goodwill resulting in an impairment charge. In the event we are required to record a non-cash impairment charge to our goodwill, other intangibles, and/or long-lived assets, such non-cash charge could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations in the reporting period in which we record the charge. 
 We use artificial intelligence in our business, and its improper use or unintended consequences could adversely affect our reputation and our results of operations. 
 We have in the past and will in the future integrate new and evolving technologies, such as artificial intelligence (AI), into our products, services and platforms. We also utilize general-purpose artificial intelligence tools in our business and these use cases may become important in our operations over time. As with many new and emerging technologies, AI presents numerous risks and challenges that could adversely affect our business. AI development, adoption, and use is in its early stages, and ineffective or inadequate AI or generative AI development or deployment practices by us or third parties could result in unintended consequences. 
 Our competitors or other third parties may incorporate AI into their products more quickly or more successfully than us, which could impair our ability to compete effectively and adversely affect our results of operations. Moreover, AI may give rise to litigation risk, including potential intellectual property, privacy, or cybersecurity liability. AI also presents emerging ethical issues and if our use of AI becomes controversial, we may experience brand or reputational harm, competitive harm, or legal liability. 
 60 

Given the complex nature of AI, our use and future plans on implementing AI into our business may be subject to an evolving regulatory landscape. For example, on October 30, 2023, the Biden administration issued an executive order to, among other things, establish extensive new standards for AI safety and security. We continue to monitor AI regulatory developments which may reduce the efficiencies we believe to be gained from AI or require further investment. 
 Catastrophic events or political instability could disrupt and cause harm to our business. 
 Our headquarters are located in the San Francisco Bay Area of California, an area susceptible to earthquakes. A major earthquake or other natural disaster, fire, threat of fire, act of terrorism, public health issues or other catastrophic event in California or elsewhere that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our critical business operations or information technology systems could severely affect our ability to conduct normal business operations and, as a result, our future operating results could be harmed. Our key manufacturing, supply and distribution partners have global operations in, among other countries, China, Thailand, Hong Kong, Japan, Mexico, Netherlands, Singapore, Taiwan, and the United States. Political instability, global conflicts, public health issues, crises, pandemics, or other catastrophic events in any of those countries, including as a result of climate change, could adversely affect our business in the future, our financial condition and operating results. 
 Our aspirations and disclosures related to Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) matters, as well as increased scrutiny and expectations from investors and others regarding Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG), could result in additional costs and/or risks, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, reputation, and stock price performance. 
 There is an increasing focus from certain investors, regulators, employees, customers, and other stakeholders concerning ESG matters. Some investors may use these non-financial performance factors to guide their investment strategies and, in some cases, may choose not to invest in us if they believe our ESG-related policies and actions are inadequate. The growing investor demand for measurement of non-financial performance is addressed by third-party providers of sustainability assessment and ESG ratings on companies. The criteria by which our ESG practices are assessed may change due to the constant evolution of the sustainability landscape, which could result in greater expectations of us and cause us to undertake costly initiatives to satisfy such new criteria. If we elect not to or are unable to satisfy such new criteria, investors and other stakeholders may conclude that our ESG-related policies and/or actions with respect to corporate social responsibility are inadequate. There have also been increasing allegations of greenwashing against companies making significant ESG claims due to a variety of perceived deficiencies in performance. As stakeholder perceptions of sustainability continue to evolve, we may face reputational damage and potential stakeholder engagement and/or litigation in the event that we do not meet the ESG standards set by various constituencies. In addition, there exists certain anti-ESG sentiment among some individuals and government institutions, and we may also face scrutiny, reputational risk, lawsuits, or market access restrictions from these parties regarding our ESG initiatives. 
 In June 2024, we published our 2024 Corporate Sustainability Report, highlighting our ongoing efforts to reduce our Scope 1 and Scope 2 carbon emissions in our U.S. locations and our commitment to legal and ethical business practices. These statements reflect our current plans and aspirations and are not guarantees that we will be able to achieve them. Our ability to achieve any CSR objective is subject to numerous risks, many of which are outside of our control. Examples of such risks include the availability and cost of renewable energy sources, evolving consumer protection and other regulatory laws applicable to CSR matters, and the availability of funds to invest in ESG initiatives in times where we are seeking to reduce costs. As a result, we could fail, or be perceived to fail, in our achievement of such initiatives or goals, or we could be criticized for the scope, target and timelines of previously announced ESG initiatives or goals. If we fail to satisfy the expectations of investors, regulators, customers, employees, and other stakeholders, if our initiatives are not executed as planned, or if we fail to implement sufficient oversight or accurately capture and disclose ESG matters, our reputation and business, operating results and financial condition could be adversely impacted. 
 Standards for tracking and reporting CSR matters continue to evolve. Our selection of voluntary disclosure frameworks and standards, and the interpretation or application of those frameworks and standards, may change from time to time or differ from those of others. Methodologies for reporting CSR data may be updated and previously reported data may be adjusted to reflect improvement in availability and quality of third-party data, changing assumptions, changes in the nature and scope of our operations and other changes in circumstances. 
 61 

Our processes and controls for reporting CSR matters across our operations and supply chain are evolving along with multiple disparate standards for identifying, measuring, and reporting metrics, including CSR-related disclosures pursuant to voluntary disclosure standards and those that are or may be required by the SEC and other regulators, and such standards, or interpretation and guidance thereof, may change over time, which could result in significant revisions to our current goals, reported progress in achieving such goals, or ability to achieve such goals in the future. 
 Risks related to our Intellectual Property and technology licenses 
 Our intellectual property and proprietary rights may not adequately protect our products and services, and our business may suffer if third parties infringe our rights. 
 We own patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, and other intellectual property (collectively, intellectual property) related to aspects of our products, software, services, and designs. Our commercial success may depend in part on our ability to obtain, maintain and protect these rights in the United States and abroad. 
 We regularly file patent applications to protect innovations arising from our research, development, and design as we deem appropriate. We may fail to apply for patents on important products, services, technologies, or designs in a timely fashion, or at all. We may not have sufficient intellectual property rights in all countries where unauthorized third-party copying or use of our proprietary technology occurs, and the scope of our intellectual property might be more limited in certain countries. Our existing and future patents may not be sufficient to protect our products, services, technologies, or designs and/or may not prevent others from developing competing products, services, technologies or designs. We cannot predict the validity and enforceability of our patents and other intellectual property with certainty. 
 We have registered, applied to register, and/or used certain of our trademarks in several jurisdictions worldwide. In some of those jurisdictions, third-party registrations, filings, or common law use exist for the same, similar or otherwise related products or services, which could block the registration of or ability to use our marks. Even if we are able to register our marks, competitors may adopt or file similar marks to ours, seek to cancel our trademark registrations, register domain names that mimic or incorporate our marks, or otherwise infringe upon or harm our trademark rights. Although we police our trademark rights carefully, there can be no assurance that we are aware of all third-party uses or that we will prevail in enforcing our rights in all such instances. Any of these negative outcomes could affect the strength, value and effectiveness of our brand, as well as our ability to market our products. 
 We have also registered domain names for websites that we use in our business, such as GoPro.com, as well as social media handles. If we are unable to protect our domain names or social media handles, our brand, business, and operating results could be adversely affected. Domain names or social media handles similar to ours have already been registered in the United States and elsewhere, and we may not be able to prevent third parties from acquiring and using domain names or social media handles that infringe, are similar to, or otherwise decrease the value of, our trademarks. In addition, we might not be able to, or may choose not to, acquire, or maintain trademark registrations, domain names, social media handles or other related rights in certain jurisdictions. 
 Unauthorized third parties may try to copy or reverse engineer our products, infringe upon or misappropriate our intellectual property, or otherwise gain access to our technology. We may discover unauthorized products in the marketplace that are knock-offs, infringements, or counterfeit reproductions of our products. If we are unable to stop producers or sellers of infringing or counterfeit products, sales of these products could adversely impact our brand and business. 
 Litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights. We have initiated legal proceedings to protect our intellectual property rights, and we may file additional actions in the future. For example, on March 29, 2024, we filed a complaint with the U.S. International Trade Commission against Arashi Vision Inc., d/b/a Insta360 and Arashi Vision (U.S.) LLC, d/b/a Insta360 and a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California against Arashi Vision Inc., d/b/a Insta360, and Arashi Vision (U.S.) LLC, d/b/a Insta360 , alleging patent infringement of certain GoPro patents related to our cameras and digital imaging technology. Insta360 has filed several IPR petitions seeking to challenge the validity of the GoPro patents asserted against Insta360. Initiating infringement proceedings against third parties, as well as defending against IPRs, can be expensive, may take significant time, and may divert management s attention from other business concerns. The cost of protecting our 
 62 

intellectual property has been and may in the future be substantial, and there is no assurance we will be successful. Our business could be adversely affected because of any such legal actions, or a finding that any patents-in-suit are invalid or unenforceable. These legal actions may in the future lead to additional counterclaims against us, which are expensive to defend against and for which there can be no assurance of a favorable outcome. Further, parties we bring legal action against could retaliate through non-litigious means, which could harm our business or operations. 
 We have been, and in the future may be, subject to intellectual property and proprietary rights claims from third parties and may be sued by third parties for alleged infringement. 
 Third parties, including competitors and non-practicing entities, have made allegations of and brought intellectual property infringement, misappropriation, and other intellectual property rights claims against us, including the matter described in Note 10 Commitments, contingencies, and guarantees in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. While we will defend ourselves vigorously against any such existing and future legal proceedings, the effort and expense to support such disputes and litigation is considerable and we may not prevail or obtain favorable outcomes against all such allegations, including in the matter described in Note 10 Commitments, contingencies, and guarantees in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 We may seek licenses from third parties where appropriate, but they could refuse to grant us a license or demand commercially unreasonable terms. Further, an adverse ruling in an infringement proceeding could force us to suspend or permanently cease the production or sale of products/services, face a temporary or permanent injunction, redesign or rebrand our products/services, pay significant settlement costs, pay third-party license fees or damage awards or give up some of our intellectual property. The occurrence of any of these events may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, or cash flows. 
 If we are unable to maintain, license, or acquire rights to include intellectual property owned by others in the products, services or content distributed by us, our marketing, sales or future business strategy could be affected, or we could be subject to lawsuits relating to our use of this content. 
 The distribution of GoPro content helps to market our brand, products, and subscription and service. If we cannot continue to acquire rights to distribute user-generated content or to use and distribute music, athlete and celebrity names and likenesses or other content for our original productions or third-party entertainment distribution channels or for our mobile app, our marketing efforts could be diminished, our sales could be harmed and our future content strategy could be adversely affected. In addition, third-party content providers or owners may allege that we have violated their intellectual property rights. If we are unable to obtain sufficient rights, successfully defend our use of or otherwise alter our business practices on a timely basis in response to claims of infringement, misappropriation, misuse or other violation of third-party intellectual property rights, our business may be adversely affected. As a user and distributor of content, we face potential liability for rights of publicity and privacy, as well as copyright, or trademark infringement or other claims based on the nature and content of materials that we distribute. If we are found to violate such third-party rights, then our business may suffer. 
 We use open-source software in our platform that may subject our technology to general release or require us to re-engineer our solutions, which may harm our business. 
 We use open-source software in connection with our products and services. From time to time, companies that incorporate open-source software into their products or services have faced claims challenging the ownership of open-source software and/or compliance with open-source license terms. Therefore, we could be subject to suits by parties claiming ownership of what we believe to be open-source software or noncompliance with open-source licensing terms. Some open-source software licenses require users who distribute or make available open-source software as part of their software to publicly disclose all or part of the source code to such software or make available any derivative works of the open-source code on unfavorable terms or at no cost. While we monitor our use of open-source software and try to ensure that none is used in a manner that would require us to disclose the source code or that would otherwise breach the terms of an open-source agreement, such use could nevertheless occur despite policies and controls that we have in place, and we may be required to publicly release our proprietary source code, pay damages for breach of contract, re-engineer our applications, discontinue sales in the event re-engineering cannot be accomplished on a timely basis or take other remedial action that may divert 
 63 

resources away from our development efforts, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition or operating results. 
 In addition to risks related to license requirements, use of open-source software can involve greater risks than those associated with use of third-party commercial software, as open-source licensors generally do not provide warranties, assurances of title, performance, non-infringement, or controls on the origin of the software. There is typically no support available for open-source software, and we cannot assure you that the authors of such open-source software will not abandon further development and maintenance. Open-source software may contain security vulnerabilities, and we may be subject to additional security risk by using open-source software. Many of the risks associated with the use of open-source software cannot be eliminated, and could, if not properly addressed, negatively affect our business. We have established processes to help alleviate these risks, including a review process for screening requests from our development organizations for the use of open-source software, but we cannot be sure that all open-source software is identified or submitted for approval prior to use in our solution. 
 Risks related to regulatory compliance 
 We are subject to governmental regulation and other legal obligations, particularly related to privacy, data protection and information security, and our actual or perceived failure to comply with such obligations could adversely affect our business and operating results. 
 Personal privacy, data protection and information security are significant issues in the United States and the other jurisdictions where we offer our products and services. The regulatory framework for privacy and security issues worldwide is rapidly evolving and is likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future. Our handling of data is subject to a variety of laws and regulations, including regulation by various government agencies, including the United States Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and various state, local and foreign regulators, and agencies. Our agreements with certain customers and business partners may also subject us to certain requirements related to our processing of personal information, including obligations to use industry-standard or reasonable security measures to safeguard personal information. 
 The United States and various state and foreign governments have adopted or proposed limitations on the collection, distribution, use and storage of personal information of individuals, including end-customers and employees. In the United States, the FTC and many state attorneys general are applying federal and state consumer protection laws to the online collection, use, processing, storage, deletion, and dissemination of personal information. Further, all states have enacted laws requiring companies to notify individuals, regulatory authorities and others of security breaches involving personal information. 
 We also expect that there will continue to be new proposed laws, regulations and industry standards concerning privacy, data protection and information security in the United States, the EU and other jurisdictions, and we cannot always predict the impact of such future laws, regulations, and standards may have on our business. We expect that existing laws, regulations, and standards may even be interpreted differently or inconsistently relative to each other in the future. California initiated the first wave of state consumer privacy laws by enacting the California Consumer Privacy Act (the CCPA), as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act (the CPRA). Following California's lead, several other states have enacted privacy laws. Failure to comply with these new state regulations may result in significant civil penalties, injunctive relief, or statutory or actual damages. Complying with this new privacy legislation may result in additional costs and expenses. 
 Additionally, many foreign countries and governmental bodies, including Australia, the EU, the U.K., India, Japan, and numerous other jurisdictions in which we operate or conduct our business, have laws and regulations concerning the collection, use, processing, storage, and deletion of personal information obtained from their residents or by businesses operating within their jurisdiction. These laws and regulations often are more restrictive than those in the United States. 
 For example, in the EU and the U.K., the respective EU or U.K. General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) imposes more stringent data protection requirements, provides an enforcement authority, and imposes large penalties for noncompliance. If we fail to comply with the respective GDPR or if regulators assert that we have failed to comply with the GDPR, we may be subject to fines of up to 4 of our worldwide annual revenue under EU GDPR requirements and up to 4 of our worldwide annual turnover under the UK s implementation of GDPR. 
 64 

Among other requirements, both the EU and U.K. GDPR regulates transfers of personal data outside of the EU to countries that have not been found to provide adequate protection to personal data, including the United States, requiring that certain steps are taken to legitimize those transfers. We have undertaken certain efforts to conform transfers of personal data from the EU to the United States and other jurisdictions based on our understanding of current regulatory obligations and the guidance of regulators and data protection authorities. Despite this, we may be unsuccessful in establishing or maintaining conforming means of transferring such data from the European Economic Area or the U.K. particularly as a result of continued legal and legislative activity that has challenged or called into question the legal basis for existing means of data transfers to countries that have not been found to provide adequate protection for personal data. We continue to monitor these regulatory and legal developments. 
 In addition to government regulation, privacy advocates and industry groups may propose new and different self-regulatory standards. These and other industry standards may legally or contractually apply to us, or we may elect to comply with such standards. It is possible that if our practices are not consistent, or are viewed as not consistent, with legal and regulatory requirements, including changes in laws, regulations and standards or new interpretations or applications of existing laws, regulations and standards, we may become subject to audits, inquiries, whistleblower complaints, adverse media coverage, investigations, loss of export privileges, fines, awards, penalties, injunctions, judgments, or criminal or civil sanctions, all of which may have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, reputation, and financial condition. 
 Future laws, regulations, standards and other obligations, as well as changes in the interpretation of existing laws, regulations, standards and other obligations could impair our ability to collect, use or disclose information relating to individuals, which could decrease demand for our products, require us to restrict our business operations, increase our costs, and impair our ability to maintain and grow our customer base and increase our revenue. For example, in June 2024 in Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo (Loper), the Supreme Court held that courts need not defer to a governmental agency s interpretation of an ambiguous statute that it administers but can consider an administrative agency s interpretation when it falls within such agency s purview, or adhere to a less deferential standard. As a result of Loper, we cannot be sure whether there will be increased challenges to existing agency regulations or how lower courts will apply Loper in the context of other regulatory schemes without more specific guidance from the Supreme Court. 
 The Supreme Court s decision in Loper could significantly impact ESG regulation with respect to agency guidance previously issued on greenhouse gas emissions, sustainable investing and advertising, workplace and board diversity, and anti-corruption measures. Any inability to adequately address privacy and security concerns, even if unfounded, or comply with applicable laws, regulations, policies (including ESG-related policies), industry standards, contractual obligations or other legal obligations could result in additional cost and liability to us, damage our reputation, inhibit sales, and adversely affect our business and operating results. 
 We could be adversely affected by violations of the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the United Kingdom Bribery Act or similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions in which we operate. 
 The global nature of our business and the significance of our international revenue create various domestic and local regulatory challenges and subject us to risks associated with our international operations. The United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), the United Kingdom Bribery Act 2010 (the U.K. Bribery Act), and similar anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit United States based companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to non-United States officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business, directing business to another, or securing a competitive advantage. In addition, United States public companies are required to maintain records that accurately and fairly represent their transactions and have an adequate system of internal accounting controls. Under the FCPA, United States companies may be held liable for the corrupt actions taken by their directors, officers, employees, agents, or other strategic or local partners or representatives. As such, if we or our intermediaries fail to comply with the requirements of the FCPA or similar legislation, governmental authorities in the United States and elsewhere could seek to impose substantial civil and/or criminal fines and penalties, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, operating results, and financial condition. 
 We operate in areas of the world that experience corruption by government officials to some degree and, in certain circumstances, compliance with anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws may conflict with local customs and practices. Our global operations require us to import and export to and from several countries, which 
 65 

geographically expands our compliance obligations. In addition, changes in such laws could result in increased regulatory requirements and compliance costs which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. We cannot be assured that our directors, officers, employees, agents or other strategic or local partners or representatives will not engage in prohibited conduct and render us responsible under the FCPA or the U.K. Bribery Act. While we have compliance programs in place, they may not be effective to prevent violations from occurring and our directors, officers, employees, or agents may engage in prohibited conduct, nonetheless. If we are found to be in violation of the FCPA, the U.K. Bribery Act or other anti-bribery or anti-corruption laws (either due to the acts or inadvertence of our employees or due to the acts or inadvertence of others), we could suffer criminal or civil penalties or other sanctions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, operating results and financial condition. 
 If we fail to comply with regulations relating to environmental and social matters, including the SEC s conflict minerals disclosure rules, our business, financial condition, operating results, and reputation could be adversely affected. 
 We are subject to various federal, state, local, and international environmental laws and regulations including laws regulating the manufacture, import, use, discharge, and disposal of hazardous materials, labeling and notice requirements relating to potential consumer exposure to certain chemicals, and laws relating to the collection of and recycling of electrical and electronic equipment and their packaging. 
 We are also subject to the SEC s conflict minerals rule which requires disclosure by public companies of the origin, source, and chain of custody of specified minerals, known as conflict minerals , that are necessary to the functionality or production of products manufactured or contracted to be manufactured. We have and will continue to incur costs associated with complying with the rule, such as costs related to sourcing of certain minerals (or derivatives thereof), the determination of the origin, source and chain of custody of the minerals used in our products, the adoption of conflict minerals-related governance policies, processes and controls, and possible changes to products or sources of supply as a result of such activities. Within our supply chain, we may not be able to sufficiently verify the origins of the relevant minerals used in our products through the data collection and due diligence procedures that we implement, which may harm our reputation. 
 Although we have policies and procedures in place requiring our contract manufacturers and major component suppliers to comply with applicable federal, state, local and international requirements, we cannot confirm that our manufacturers and suppliers consistently comply with these requirements. In addition, if there are changes to these or other laws (or their interpretation) or if new similar laws are passed in other jurisdictions, we may be required to re-engineer our products to use components compatible with these regulations. Any re-engineering and component substitution could result in additional costs to us or disrupt our operations or logistics. 
 Changes in interpretation of any federal, state, local or international regulation may cause us to incur costs or have additional regulatory requirements to meet in the future in order to comply with such regulations, or with any similar laws adopted in other jurisdictions. Our failure to comply with past, present, and future similar laws could result in reduced sales of our products, substantial product inventory write-offs, reputational damage, penalties and other sanctions, which could harm our business and financial condition. 
 We also expect that our products will be affected by new environmental laws and regulations, including but not limited to laws and regulations focused on climate change, on an ongoing basis. Concerns about climate change have driven significant legislative and regulatory changes on a global basis, and there are expected to be additional changes to the regulations in these areas. These changes could directly increase the cost of energy, which may have an impact on the way we manufacture products or utilize energy to produce our products. We may also become subject to regulations resulting in increased disclosure obligations with respect to climate change, including with respect to our greenhouse gas emissions. In addition, any new regulations or laws in the environmental area might increase the cost of raw materials we use in our products and the cost of compliance, or cause disruptions in the manufacture of our products and result in increased procurement, production, and distribution costs. Our reputation and brand could be harmed if we fail, or are perceived as having failed, to respond responsibly and effectively to changes in legal and regulatory measures adopted to address climate change. We face increasing complexity in our product design and procurement operations as we adjust to new and future requirements relating to the composition of our products, their safe use, the energy consumption associated with those products, climate change laws and regulations, and product repairability, reuse, recallability 
 66 

and take-back legislation. Other regulations in the environmental area may require us to continue to monitor and ensure proper disposal or recycling of our products. Since we operate on a global basis, this is a complex process that requires continual monitoring. 
 To date, our expenditures for environmental compliance have not had a material effect on our results of operations or cash flows and, although we cannot predict the future effect of such laws or regulations, they will likely result in additional costs and may increase penalties associated with violations or require us to change the content of our products or how they are manufactured, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. 
 In addition, new disclosure standards and rules related to other ESG matters, including with respect to human rights, impact on affected communities, pollution, water stewardship, biodiversity and the circular economy, have been adopted and may continue to be introduced in various states and other jurisdictions. For example, the European Union Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive became effective in 2023 and applies to both EU and non-EU entities. In October 2023, California adopted new carbon and climate-related reporting requirements for large public and private companies doing business in the state. In March 2024, the SEC adopted final rules requiring the disclosure of certain climate-related information in registration statements and annual reports which were stayed on April 4, 2024 by the SEC until the completion of judicial review. The SEC has since indicated that it intends to establish a new implementation period following the stay order. We are currently evaluating the impact of this final rule on our disclosures. 
 As the nature, scope, and complexity of ESG reporting, diligence and disclosure requirements expand, significant effort and expenses could be required to comply with the evolving requirements. As our disclosure obligations increase, third parties may make claims or bring litigation relating to those disclosures which may be costly. 
 We are subject to governmental export and import controls and economic sanctions laws that could subject us to liability and impair our ability to compete in international markets. 
 The United States and various foreign governments have imposed controls, export license requirements, and restrictions on the import or export of some technologies and products. The U.S. Department of the Treasury s Office of Foreign Assets Control, the Department of Commerce s Bureau of Industry and Security, and U.S. Customs and Border Protection administer regulations that restrict U.S. persons in conducting certain export and import activities, as well as conducting business with or in certain countries, governments, entities, and individuals. Our activities and products are consequently subject to United States import, economic sanctions and export control laws, and exports and imports of our products must be made in compliance with such laws, which are complex and continuously changing. Furthermore, United States export control laws and economic sanctions prohibit the provision of products and services to countries, governments, and persons, and for specified end uses, that are targeted by United States economic sanctions and export control laws. Even though we have established procedures designed to enable our compliance with United States sanctions and export control laws, and it is our policy not to do business with any countries or customers located in countries targeted by comprehensive U.S. economic sanctions, our products, including our firmware updates, could inadvertently be provided to targets of U.S. economic sanctions and export control laws, or could be provided by our customers to those targets. Any such provision, as well as any other activity or transaction contrary to U.S. economic sanctions and export control laws, could have negative consequences, including government investigations, denial of export privileges, penalties and reputational harm. Our failure to obtain required import or export approval for our products or activities could harm our international and domestic sales and adversely affect our business, revenue and results of operations. 
 We could also become subject to future enforcement action with respect to compliance with governmental export and import controls and economic sanctions laws that result in penalties, costs, and restrictions on export privileges that could have a material effect on our business and operating results. 
 67 

Risks related to our need for additional capital 
 We may not be able to secure additional financing on favorable terms, or at all, to meet our future capital needs. 
 In the future, we may require additional capital to respond to business opportunities, challenges, acquisitions, or unforeseen circumstances and may determine to engage in equity or debt financings or enter into credit facilities for other reasons. We may not be able to timely secure additional financing on favorable terms, or at all, due to among other things, general macroeconomic conditions, including changes in interest rates, market volatility, and inflation. 
 Additionally, our current credit facilities contain restrictive covenants relating to our capital raising activities and other financial and operational matters, and any debt financing obtained by us in the future could involve further restrictive covenants, which may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities, including potential acquisitions. Further, even if we are able to obtain additional financing, we may be required to use such proceeds to repay a portion of our debt. 
 If we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity or convertible debt or other equity-linked securities, our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing under our credit facility, or alternative sources, when we require it, our ability to grow or support our business and to respond to business challenges could be significantly limited. In the event additional financing is required from outside sources, we may not be able to raise it on terms acceptable to us or at all. 
 Risks related to ownership of our Class A common stock 
 Our stock price has been and will likely continue to be volatile. 
 Since 2023, our closing stock price ranged from a high of 6.46 in the first quarter of 2023 to a low of 1.16 in the third quarter of 2024. Our stock price may fluctuate in response to a number of events and factors, such as quarterly operating results, changes in our financial projections provided to the public or our failure to meet those projections, the public s reaction to our press releases, other public announcements and filings with the SEC, significant transactions, or new features, products or services offered by us or our competitors, changes in our business lines and product lineup, changes in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts, media coverage of our business and financial performance, the operating and stock price performance of, or other developments involving, other companies that investors may deem comparable to us, trends in our industry, any significant change in our management, and general economic conditions. These factors, as well as the volatility of our Class A common stock, could also affect the price of our convertible senior notes. 
 In addition, the stock market in general, and the market prices for companies in our industry, have experienced volatility that often has been unrelated to operating performance. These broad market and industry fluctuations may adversely affect the price of our stock, regardless of our operating performance. Price volatility over a given period may cause the average price at which we repurchase our own stock to exceed the stock s price at a given point in time. Volatility in our stock price also affects the value of our equity compensation, which affects our ability to recruit and retain employees. In addition, some companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been subject to securities class action litigation. We have been subject to past shareholder class action lawsuits as well as derivative lawsuits and may continue to be a target for such litigation in the future. Securities litigation against us could result in substantial costs and liability and divert our management s attention from other business concerns, which could harm our business. See Note 10 Commitments, contingencies, and guarantees, in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for a discussion on legal proceedings . 
 If we fail to meet expectations related to future growth, profitability, or other market expectations, our stock price may decline significantly, which could have a material adverse effect on investor confidence and employee retention. A sustained decline in our stock price and market capitalization could lead to impairment charges. 
 68 

The dual class structure of our common stock has the effect of concentrating voting control with our CEO and we cannot predict the effect our dual class structure may have on our stock price or our business. 
 Our Class B common stock has 10 votes per share, and our Class A common stock has one vote per share. Stockholders who hold shares of Class B common stock hold approximately 67.1 of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock as of September 30, 2024 with Mr. Woodman, our Chairman and CEO, holding approximately 64.2 of the outstanding voting power. Mr. Woodman is able to control all matters submitted to our stockholders, including the election of directors, amendments of our organizational documents and any merger, consolidation, sale of all or substantially all of our assets or other major corporate transaction. This concentrated control could delay, defer, or prevent a change of control, merger, consolidation, or sale of all or substantially all of our assets that our other stockholders support, or conversely this concentrated control could result in the consummation of such a transaction that our other stockholders do not support. This concentrated control could also discourage a potential investor from acquiring our Class A common stock due to the limited voting power of such stock relative to the Class B common stock and might harm the trading price of our Class A common stock. 
 In addition, we cannot predict whether our dual class structure, combined with the concentrated control by Mr. Woodman, will result in a lower or more volatile market price of our Class A common stock or in adverse publicity or other adverse consequences. For example, certain index providers, including FTSE Russell and S P Dow Jones, previously announced restrictions on including companies with multiple-class share structures in certain of their indexes that were then reversed. Because of our dual class structure, we may be excluded from these indexes in the future if new restrictions are announced, and we cannot assure you that other stock indexes will not take similar actions. Given the sustained flow of investment funds into passive strategies that seek to track certain indexes, exclusion from stock indexes would likely preclude investment by many of these funds and could make our Class A common stock less attractive to other investors. As a result, the market price of our Class A common stock could be adversely affected. 
 Delaware law and provisions in our restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws could make a merger, tender offer, or proxy contest difficult, thereby depressing the trading price of our Class A common stock. 
 Our status as a Delaware corporation and the anti-takeover provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law may discourage, delay or prevent a change in control by prohibiting us from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years after the person becomes an interested stockholder, even if a change in control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders. 
 In addition, our restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that may make the acquisition of our company more difficult without the approval of our board of directors, limit attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management, limit our stockholders ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or employees, limit the market price of our Class A common stock or otherwise adversely affect the rights of the holders of our Class A and Class B common stock. Our restated certificate of incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the exclusive forum for: any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf; any action asserting a breach of fiduciary duty; any action asserting a claim against us arising pursuant to the Delaware General Corporation Law (DGCL), our restated certificate of incorporation, or our amended and restated bylaws; or any action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine. 
 Risks related to our indebtedness and capped call transactions 
 We have indebtedness in the form of convertible senior notes. 
 In November 2020, we completed an offering of 143.8 million aggregate principal amount of 1.25 convertible senior notes due 2025 (2025 Notes). In November 2023, we repurchased 50.0 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2025 Notes for 46.3 million in cash. As a result, we now have 93.8 million in aggregate principal amount of indebtedness, the principal amount of which we may be required to pay at maturity in November 2025. 
 Holders of the remaining 2025 Notes will have the right to require us to repurchase their 2025 Notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change at a purchase price equal to 100 of the principal amount of the 2025 Notes to be purchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. In addition, the indentures for the 2025 Notes provide 
 69 

that we are required to repay amounts due under such indenture in the event that there is an event of default for the 2025 Notes that results in the principal, premium, if any, and interest, if any, becoming due prior to the maturity of the 2025 Notes. There can be no assurance that we will be able to repay our indebtedness when due, or that we will be able to refinance our indebtedness, all or in part, on acceptable terms. In addition, our indebtedness could, among other things: 
 heighten our vulnerability to adverse general economic conditions and heightened competitive pressures; 
 require us to dedicate a larger portion of our cash flow from operations to interest payments, limiting the availability of cash for other purposes; 
 limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and industry; and 
 impair our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, general corporate purposes, or other purposes. 
 In addition, our ability to purchase the remaining 2025 Notes or repay prior to maturity any accelerated amounts under the 2025 Notes upon an event of default or pay cash upon conversion of the 2025 Notes may be limited by law, by regulatory authority or by agreements governing our indebtedness outstanding at the time, including our credit facility. Our credit facility restricts our ability to repurchase the 2025 Notes for cash or repay prior to maturity any accelerated amounts under the 2025 Notes upon an event of default or pay cash upon conversion of the 2025 Notes, to the extent that on the date of such repurchase, repayment or conversion, as the case may be, we do not meet certain financial criteria set forth in the credit facility. 
 Any of our future indebtedness may contain similar restrictions. Our failure to repurchase the 2025 Notes at a time when the repurchase is required by the indentures (whether upon a fundamental change or otherwise under the indentures) or pay cash payable on future conversions of the 2025 Notes as required by the indentures would constitute a default under the indentures. A default under the indentures or the fundamental change itself could also lead to a default under agreements governing our existing or future indebtedness, including our credit facility. If the repayment of the related indebtedness were to be accelerated after any applicable notice or grace periods, we may not have sufficient funds to repay the indebtedness, repurchase the 2025 Notes or make cash payments upon conversions thereof. 
 Our credit facility imposes restrictions on us that may adversely affect our ability to operate our business. 
 Our credit facility contains restrictive covenants relating to our capital raising activities and other financial and operational matters which may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities, including potential acquisitions, or otherwise impact our liquidity. In addition, our credit facility contains, and the agreements governing the 2025 Notes will contain, a cross-default provision whereby a default under one agreement would likely result in cross defaults under agreements covering other borrowings. The occurrence of a default under any of these borrowing arrangements would permit the holders of the 2025 Notes or the lenders under our credit facility to declare all amounts outstanding under those borrowing arrangements to be immediately due and payable. If the 2025 Note holders or the trustee under the indentures governing the 2025 Notes or the lenders under our credit facility accelerate the repayment of borrowings, we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient assets to repay those borrowings. 
 Conversion of the 2025 Notes will, to the extent we deliver shares upon conversion of such 2025 Notes, dilute the ownership interest of existing stockholders, including holders who had previously converted their 2025 Notes, or may otherwise depress our stock price or may adversely affect our financial condition. 
 The conversion of some or all of the remaining 2025 Notes will dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders to the extent we deliver shares upon conversion of any of the 2025 Notes. Any sales in the public market of the Class A common stock issuable upon such conversion could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our Class A common stock. In addition, the existence of the 2025 Notes may encourage short selling by market participants because the conversion of the 2025 Notes could be used to satisfy short positions, or anticipated conversion of the 2025 Notes into shares of our Class A common stock could depress our stock price. 
 70 

In the event the conditional conversion feature of the 2025 Notes is triggered, holders of the 2025 Notes will be entitled to convert the 2025 Notes at any time during specified periods at their option. If one or more holders elect to convert their 2025 Notes, unless we elect to satisfy our conversion obligation by delivering solely shares of our Class A common stock (other than cash in lieu of any fractional share), we would be required to settle a portion or all of our conversion obligation through the payment of cash, which could adversely affect our liquidity. In addition, even if holders of the 2025 Notes do not elect to convert their 2025 Notes, we could be required under applicable accounting rules to reclassify all or a portion of the outstanding principal of the 2025 Notes as a current rather than long-term liability, which would result in a material reduction of our net working capital. 
 The accounting method for convertible debt securities that may be settled in cash, such as the 2025 Notes, may have a material effect on our reported financial results. 
 Under current GAAP, effective January 1, 2022, the treasury stock method for convertible instruments has been eliminated and instead, the application of the if-converted method is required for the determination of diluted net income (loss) per share on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. Under the if-converted method, diluted net income (loss) per share for GAAP and non-GAAP would generally be calculated assuming that all of the 2025 Notes were converted solely into shares of Class A common stock at the beginning of the reporting period, unless the result would be anti-dilutive, which would negatively affect diluted net income (loss) per share. The impact from the if converted method added approximately 10 million shares to the diluted share count after the partial repurchase of the 2025 Notes in November 2023. Under the if-converted method, some of the incremental dilution is offset as we are able to add back the after tax effected interest expense from the 2025 Notes to the extent the result would not be anti-dilutive. 
 In addition, if the conditional conversion feature of the 2025 Notes is triggered, even if holders do not elect to convert their 2025 Notes, we could be required under applicable accounting rules to reclassify all or a portion of the outstanding principal of the 2025 Notes as a current rather than long-term liability, which would result in a material reduction of our net working capital. 
 The Capped Call transactions may affect the value of the 2025 Notes and our Class A Common Stock and we are subject to counterparty risk with respect to Capped Call transactions. 
 In connection with the pricing of the 2025 Notes, we entered into privately negotiated capped call transactions (Capped Calls) with one or more financial institutions. The Capped Calls are expected generally to reduce the potential economic dilution to holders of our Class A common stock upon any conversion of the 2025 Notes, with such reduction and/or offset subject to a cap. 
 The capped call counterparties and/or their respective affiliates may modify their hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various derivatives with respect to our Class A common stock and/or purchasing or selling our Class A common stock or other securities of ours in secondary market transactions prior to the maturity of the 2025 Notes (and are likely to do so during any observation period related to a conversion of the 2025 Notes or following an repurchase of the 2025 Notes by the Company on any fundamental change repurchase date or otherwise). This activity could also cause or avoid an increase or a decrease in the market price of our Class A common stock or the 2025 Notes. 
 The potential effect, if any, of these transactions and activities on the trading price of our Class A common stock or the 2025 Notes will depend in part on market conditions. Any of these activities could adversely affect the trading price of our Class A common stock or the 2025 Notes. 
 Additionally, we will be subject to the risk that the capped call counterparties might default under the Capped Calls. Our exposure to the credit risk of the capped call counterparties is not secured by any collateral. Global economic conditions have in the recent past resulted in, and may again result in, the actual or perceived failure or financial difficulties of many financial institutions. If the capped call counterparties become subject to insolvency proceedings, we will become an unsecured creditor in those proceedings, with a claim equal to our exposure at that time under our transactions with the capped call counterparties. Our exposure will depend on many factors, but, generally, an increase in our exposure will be correlated to an increase in the market price of our Class A common stock. In addition, upon a default by the capped call counterparties, we may suffer more dilution than we currently anticipate with respect to our Class A common stock. We can provide no assurances as to the financial stability or viability of the capped call counterparties to the Capped Calls. 
 71 

General Risk Factors 
 Our effective tax rate and the intended tax benefits of our corporate structure and intercompany arrangements depend on the application of the tax laws of various jurisdictions and on how we operate our business, and such tax rates and tax benefits may change in the future. 
 We are subject to income taxes in the United States and various jurisdictions outside the United States. Our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in, or our interpretation of, tax law changes and related new or revised guidance and regulations, changes in our geographical earnings mix, unfavorable government reviews of our tax returns, material differences between our forecasted and actual annual effective tax rates, or by evolving enforcement practices. 
 In 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act) was enacted, which contained significant and impactful changes to the U.S. tax law, including, effective as of January 1, 2022, requiring the capitalization and amortization of research and development expenses. There are various proposals in Congress to amend certain provisions of the Tax Act. The state of these proposals and other future legislation remains uncertain and, if enacted, may materially affect our financial position. 
 On August 16, 2022, the United States enacted the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which introduced, among other items, an excise tax that imposes a 1 surcharge on stock repurchases, net of stock issuances, that occur after December 31, 2022. We repurchase our Class A common stock on the open market pursuant to a repurchase program initially authorized by the Company s board of directors on January 27, 2022 for the repurchase of up to 100 million of our Class A common stock and supplemented by a subsequent authorization by the board of directors on February 9, 2023 for the repurchase of an additional 40 million of our Class A common stock. As such, we could be subject to this new excise tax, depending on various factors, including the amount and frequency of any future stock repurchases and any permitted reductions or exceptions to the amount subject to the tax. We are continuing to evaluate the impact the IRA may have on our financial position and results of operations in connection with our repurchase program. 
 The United States, the European Commission, countries in the EU, Australia, and other countries where we do business have been considering changes in relevant tax, accounting and other laws, regulations and interpretations, including changes to tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals. Changes in the tax laws of foreign jurisdictions could arise as a result of the base erosion and profit shifting project that was undertaken by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). The OECD, which represents a coalition of member countries, recommended changes to numerous long-standing tax principles related to transfer pricing and continues to develop new proposals including allocating greater taxing rights to countries where customers are located and establishing a minimum tax on global income. A global consensus has been reached among approximately 138 countries, including the European Union and the OECD regarding a planned two-pillar approach to address tax challenges in the digital commerce era. The first pillar focuses on profit allocation and nexus, while the second pillar aims to establish a minimum global effective tax rate of 15 . The United States has not implemented Pillar Two legislation, but certain countries in which we operate have enacted legislation to adopt the Pillar Two framework and several other countries are also considering changes to their tax laws to implement this framework. These changes, as adopted by countries, may increase tax uncertainty and may adversely affect our provision for income taxes and cash flows. 
 We are subject to the examination of our income tax returns by the United States Internal Revenue Service and other domestic and foreign tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes and other taxes and have reserved for adjustments that may result from the current examinations. The final determination of tax audits and any related legal proceedings could materially differ from amounts reflected in our income tax provisions and accruals. In such case, our income tax provision and cash flows in the period or periods in which that determination is made could be negatively affected. 
 Our reported financial results may be negatively impacted by the changes in the accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. 
 Generally accepted accounting principles in the United States are subject to interpretation by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, the SEC and various bodies formed to promulgate and interpret appropriate 
 72 

accounting principles. A change in these principles or interpretations could have a significant effect on our reported financial results and may even affect the reporting of transactions completed before the announcement or effectiveness of a change. Other companies in our industry may apply these accounting principles differently than we do, which may affect the comparability of our condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 If our estimates or judgments relating to our critical accounting policies and estimates prove to be incorrect, our operating results could be adversely affected. 
 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, as provided in the 2023 Annual Report in the section titled Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets, liabilities and equity, and the amount of revenue and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Our operating results may be adversely affected if our assumptions change or if actual circumstances differ from those in our assumptions, which could cause our operating results to fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors, resulting in a decline in our stock price. Significant estimates and assumptions made by management include those related to revenue recognition (including sales incentives, sales returns, and implied post contract support), inventory valuation, product warranty liabilities, the valuation, impairment and useful lives of long-lived assets (property and equipment, operating lease right-of-use assets, intangible assets and goodwill), the fair value of our convertible senior notes, and income taxes.
