cash flow. No assurance can be given that any future financing will be available or, if available, that it will be on terms that are satisfactory
to the Company. Even if the Company is able to obtain additional financing, it may contain undue restrictions on our operations, in the
case of debt financing or cause substantial dilution for our stockholders, in case of equity financing.

to them. The Company records a liability when a particular contingency is probable and estimable. The Company faces contingencies that
are reasonably possible to occur; however, they cannot currently be estimated. While assurance cannot be given as to the outcome of these
disputes, management does not currently believe that any of these matters, individually or in the aggregate are estimable or probable
and is therefore unable to represent whether they would have a material adverse effect on the Company s financial condition, liquidity
or results of operations. It is reasonably possible that a change in the contingencies could result in a change in the amount recorded

(A) The first Howard note was advanced on
06/28/2016 and the second on 04/03/2017 to Microvascular Health Solutions, LLC. Both notes had one-year terms and both notes are in
default. The stated interest rate on each note was 2.5 per month, upon default the interest rate increased to 3.5 per month. The
notes are secured by the accounts receivable of the borrower. At year end after the default each note contained a provision
entitling the lender to 5 ownership in the borrower, a consolidated subsidiary. The Company estimates that if the interest in the
subsidiary were converted into its common shares it would represent an equivalent of 29,400,000 common shares, which would only be
issuable in lieu of the interest in the subsidiary, if agreed upon by the Company. 

(B) The Goff note had a maturity date of
February 13 th , 2016, the note is in default. The original note advanced 15,000 and called for a payment of 22,500 on
the maturity date. The note provides for a 4 interest rate per annum after the maturity date. 

(C) Insurance notes are from finance companies
that provided short term financing of insurance premiums. The notes require ten installments. The balance will mature at May 3rd, 2024
for the 1,357 and June 1 st , 2024 for 14,752. 

(D) In January of 2024, the Company issued two
notes for 165,000 each, Alder and Genisis Glass. The notes are due in twelve months from the note date or before if the company brings
in equity equal to 1,500,000. The funds were designated for the improvement of the technical infrastructure of the newly acquired DocSun
Biomedical Holdings, Inc. Each note was issued with a 15,000 original issue discount. Loan fees of 1,000 plus 4,500 common shares with
a fair value of 9,990 were paid to each lender. The amounts recorded are net of unamortized discounts of 19,376 each consisting of the
original discount and fair value of shares issued.

(E) EIDL Notes 

The principal amount of economic injury
disaster loans (EIDL) issued under the Small Business Administration s COVID-19 recovery program was 150,000 and 350,000 at
June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. At June 30,2024, the long-term balance of the EIDL loans was 150,000 and the
current balance for delinquent loans was 400,000. The total balance is comprised of three notes made by subsidiaries of the
Company, secured by the assets of the Company. One of which was acquired in the merger with Findit, Inc. and is in charge off status
at the SBA. The Findit EIDL loan and the other 200,000 subsidiary loan are in default and shown as current liabilities. Each loan
has a 30-year term and an interest rate of 3.75 per annum. The SBA granted a total of thirty months payment deferment period under
the EIDL program for Covid-19 related loans, both EIDL loans qualified for and used the full deferment period. Interest continued to
accrue during the deferment period and the deferred amounts will be paid as a balloon payment at the end of the 30-year amortization
period. Current payments are being applied against interest accrued. The notes maturity dates are May 17, 2050 for a 150,000 note,
July 12, 2051 for a 200,000 note and July 17, 2050 for the Findit EIDL loan. 

(F) The convertible notes have a stated interest
rate of 16 , of which 10 is payable by adding to the principal of the note and 6 is payable in cash, biannually. The notes are convertible
into common shares at the option of the noteholder at 0.09 cents per common share. The notes mature 2 years after the note date. The Company
has the option to convert the convertible notes in the event of an uplift to a national stock exchange. The conversion price to the Company
is the lessor of 0.09 cents or 85 of the price at on the national exchange. For each 5,000 principal of the notes, the Company granted
2,500 warrants to purchase common stock at 0.20 cents pe common share. The warrants expire 2 years after the Company s shares are
listed on an internationally recognized exchange. In June of 2024, three notes were issued for proceeds totaling 100,000. A total of
50,000 warrants with a fair value of 839 were paid in relation to the note proceeds. The amounts recorded are net of unamortized discounts

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market
Risk 

Not required for a smaller reporting
company. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 

Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Disclosure controls and procedures are designed to
ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized
and reported, within the time period specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated
to management, including the CEO and CFO, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. Our management necessarily
applied its judgment in assessing the costs and benefits of such controls and procedures, which, by their nature, can provide only reasonable
assurance regarding management s control objectives. 

Our management, with the participation of our CEO,
evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the period ended June 30, 2024.
Based upon this evaluation, our CEO concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective because of the identification
material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting as described below. 

Management s Report on Internal Control
Over Financial Reporting 

Our management is responsible for establishing and
maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Rule 13a-15(f). Our internal control
over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance to our management and board of directors regarding
the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP. 

Our internal control over financial reporting includes
those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect
the transactions and dispositions of our assets; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP and our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with
authorizations of our management and directors; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements. 

32 

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control
over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent
limitations, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention of overriding controls. Accordingly, even effective internal
control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation. Also, projections
of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in
conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal
control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2024. In making this assessment, it used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Tread way Commission COSO in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013). Based on this evaluation,
management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of June 30, 2024. Our management concluded
we have the following material weaknesses . A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of control deficiencies, in internal
control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial
statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. 

Ineffective Control Environment. The Company did not maintain
an effective control environment, which is the foundation necessary for effective internal control over financial reporting. Specifically,
the Company (i) did not maintain a functioning independent audit committee; (ii) did not have its Board of Directors review and approve
significant transactions; (iii) had an insufficient number of personnel appropriately qualified to perform control design, execution and
monitoring activities; (iv) had an insufficient number of personnel with an appropriate level of U.S. GAAP knowledge and experience and
ongoing training in the application of U.S. GAAP and SEC disclosure requirements commensurate with the Company s financial reporting
requirements; (v) had inadequate segregation of duties consistent with control objectives; and (vi) lack of written documentation of the
Company s key internal control policies and procedures over financial reporting. The Company is required under Section 404 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act to have written documentation of key internal control over financial reporting. The Company did not formally document
policies and controls to enable management and other personnel to understand and carry out their internal control responsibilities including
the lack of closing checklists, budget-to-actual analyses, balance sheet variation analysis, and pro-forma financial statements. Additionally,
the Company did not have an adequate process in place to complete its testing and assessment of the design and operating effectiveness
of internal control over financial reporting in a timely manner; 

Ineffective controls over financial statement close and reporting process. The
Company did not maintain effective controls over its financial statement close and reporting process. Specifically, the Company: (i) had
insufficient preparation and review procedures for disclosures accompanying the Company s financial statements; and (ii) did not
provide reasonable assurance that accounts were complete and accurate and agreed to detailed support and that reconciliations of accounts
were properly performed, reviewed and approved; and 

Insufficient segregation of duties in our finance and accounting functions
due to limited personnel. We do not have sufficient segregation of duties within accounting functions. During the period ended
June 30, 2024, we had limited personnel that performed nearly all aspects of our financial reporting process, including, but not limited
to, access to the underlying accounting records and systems, the ability to post and record journal entries and responsibility for the
preparation of the financial statements. Due to the fact that these duties were often performed by the same person, this creates a lack
of review over the financial reporting process that would likely result in a failure to detect errors in spreadsheets, calculations, or
assumptions used to compile the financial statements and related disclosures as filed with the SEC. These control deficiencies could result
in a material misstatement to our interim or annual financial statements that would not be prevented or detected. 

As of the date of this report, our remediation efforts continue related
to each of the material weaknesses that we have identified in our internal control over financial reporting, and additional time and resources
will be required in order to fully address these material weaknesses. We have not been able to complete all actions necessary and test
the remediated controls in a manner that would enable us to conclude that such controls are effective. We are committed to implementing
the necessary controls to remediate the material weaknesses described below as our resources permit. These material weaknesses will not
be considered remediated until (1) the new processes are designed, appropriately controlled and implemented for a sufficient period of
time and (2) we have sufficient evidence that the new processes and related controls are operating effectively. 

33 

We do not expect that our disclosure controls and
procedures will prevent all errors and all instances of fraud. Disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated,
can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the disclosure controls and procedures are met. Further, the
design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits must be considered
relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all disclosure controls and procedures, no evaluation of disclosure controls
and procedures can provide absolute assurance that we have detected all our control deficiencies and instances of fraud, if any. The design
of disclosure controls and procedures also is based partly on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can
be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. 

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting 

During the quarter ended June 30, 2024, there were
no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that
have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

34 

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings 

We are not currently involved in any pending legal
proceeding or litigation and, to the best of our knowledge, no governmental authority is contemplating any proceeding to which we are
a party or to which any of our properties is subject, which would reasonably be likely to have a material adverse effect on us. 

We are involved in disputes with certain parties,
including parties that are former officers and board members and vendors associated with their activities. Such disputes arise from time
to time in the ordinary course of conducting business. While assurance cannot be given as to the outcome of these disputes, management
does not currently believe that any of these matters, individually or in the aggregate are estimable or probable and is therefore unable
to represent whether they would have a material adverse effect on the Company s financial condition, liquidity or results of operations.
Refer to Note 8. Commitments and Contingencies Company Disputes and Other Claims in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated
Financial Statements set forth in Part I, Item 1 Financial Statements of this Quarterly Report, for further information.

have a stated interest rate of 16 , of which 10 is payable by adding to the principal of the note and 6 is payable in cash, biannually.
The notes are convertible into common shares at the option of the noteholder at 0.09 cents per common share. The notes mature 2 years
after the note date. The Company has the option to convert the convertible notes in the event of an uplist to a national stock exchange.
The conversion price to the Company is the lessor of 0.09 cents or 85 of the price at on the national exchange. For each 5,000 principal
of the notes, the Company granted 2,500 warrants to purchase common stock at 0.20 cents per common share. The warrants expire 2 years
after the Company s shares are listed on a national securities exchange. The purchasers of the convertible notes represented their
intention to acquire these securities for investment only and not with a view to offer or sell, in connection with any distribution of
the securities, and appropriate legends were affixed to the instruments issued in such transactions.

 Adjustment of Number of Conversion Shares . The number of Conversion Shares issuable upon the conversion of the Notes is

its equity securities in additional equity securities; (ii) subdivide its outstanding shares of equity securities into a greater number
of equity securities; or (iii) combine its outstanding equity securities into a smaller number of equity securities, the Conversion Price

the number of Conversion Shares which the Purchasers would have owned or would have been entitled to receive after the happening of any
of the events described above had a Note been converted immediately prior to the record date, in the case of a distribution, or the effective
date, in the case of a subdivision or combination. An adjustment made pursuant to this Section 4.6(a) shall become effective immediately
after the record date, in the case of a distribution, except as provided in Section 4.6(c), and shall become effective immediately after
the effective date, in the case of a subdivision or combination. No adjustment in the Conversion Price shall be made if, at the same time
as the Company shall issue equity securities as a distribution on the outstanding shares which would otherwise call for an adjustment
in the Conversion Price, the Company shall issue such equity securities as a distribution on the outstanding Notes equivalent to the number
and type of equity securities distributable on the outstanding equity securities (as if this Note were ultimately converted under Section
4.1). 

(b) Other Distributions . In case the Company shall distribute to all holders
of its equity securities (including any such distribution made in connection with a consolidation, conversion or merger in which the Company
is the continuing corporation) evidences of its indebtedness or assets (excluding cash distributions and distributions referred in Section

securities containing the right to subscribe for or purchase debt securities, assets or other securities of the Company (excluding those
referred to in Section 4.6(a) above), then, in each case, the Company shall set aside and maintain for the benefit of the Purchasers the
rights, options, warrants, or convertible or exchangeable securities, or evidences of indebtedness or assets, in an amount equal to the
distribution of such item that the Purchasers would have been entitled to receive after the happening of any of the events described above
had the Notes been converted under this Section 4 immediately prior to the record date of the distribution. Such rights, options, warrants,
or convertible or exchangeable securities, or evidences of indebtedness or assets shall be delivered to the Purchasers upon conversion
of the Notes. 

(c) Notice Upon Adjustment. Whenever there is an adjustment in the number or kind of
equity securities issuable upon conversion of the Notes, or both, as provided in this Section 4.6, the Company shall: (i) issue a certificate
signed by the chief executive of the Company, showing in detail the facts requiring such adjustment and the number and kind of equity
securities issuable upon conversion of each Note after such adjustment; and (ii) cause a notice stating that such adjustment has been

the debt evidenced by the Notes: (i) the Company shall declare any distribution payable in equity securities of the Company; or (ii) the
Company shall authorize the issuance to all holders of equity securities of rights, options or warrants to subscribe for or purchase equity
securities or of any other subscription rights or warrants; or (iii) the Company shall authorize the distribution to all holders of equity
securities evidences of its indebtedness or assets; or (iv) the Board of Directors of the Company shall have approved any consolidation,

transfer or lease of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company or any reclassification or change of equity securities issuable
upon conversion of the Notes (other than as a result of a subdivision or combination), or a tender offer or exchange offer for equity
securities; or (v) the voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the Company occurs; or (vi) the Company proposes
to take any action which would require an adjustment in the number or kind of equity securities issuable upon conversion of the

to the applicable record date specified, or promptly in the case of events for which there is no record date, a written notice stating: 

(A) the date as of which the holders of record of equity securities to be entitled
to receive any such rights, options, warrants or distribution are to be determined; 

(B) the initial expiration date set forth in any tender offer or exchange offer for
equity securities; or

lease, reclassification, change, dissolution, liquidation or winding up is expected to become effective or consummated, and the date as

make any change in the form of the Notes that it may reasonably deem appropriate because of any adjustment made pursuant to this Section

may be in the form as so changed.

In the event of prepayment, should a Purchaser wish NOT to convert, such Purchaser may take no action, or such Purchaser may notify the Company by written notice of such Purchaser s demand to receive prepayment in lieu of optional conversion. For each prepayment of principal under the Notes, the Company shall pay each Purchaser a pro-rata amount of such prepayment based on the then outstanding principal under a Purchaser s Note and the total then outstanding principal under all of the Notes.
