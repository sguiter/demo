Kaya Shack 
Store 3 and Kaya Shack Store 4 were both closed due to consolidation moves by the Company in 2020 and 2021, respectively, and
the Company let the licenses lapse. 

In
August of 2017, the Company purchased a 26-acre parcel in Lebanon, Linn County, Oregon for 510,000 on which we intended to construct
a Greenhouse Grow and Production Facility (the Property and filed for OLCC licensure. In August of 2022, the Company
entered into an agreement (the CVC Agreement with CVC International, Inc. CVC ), an institutional
investor who holds certain of the Company s Convertible Promissory Notes (the Notes ), one of which was secured
by a 500,000 mortgage on the Property. CVC released its lien on the Property to enable the Company to sell the Property and utilize the
proceeds therefrom for the benefit of the Company and its shareholders, without having to repay CVC the 500,000 Note held by CVC. Additionally,
CVC agreed to advance certain sums against the sale of the Property Advances ), which amounted to 270,000 pending
the sale of the Property. On February 28, 2023 we sold the Property for a price of 769,500, less commissions and customary closing costs.
The net proceeds of the sale were used to repay the advances plus interest (including an additional 100,000 borrowed from another lender
interest) and the Company realized net proceeds of approximately 302,000,000. The land is reflected on the balance sheet as assets held
for sale for the year ended December 31, 2022 at a value of 516,076. The land was sold in 2023. 

On September 26,
2019, the Company formed the majority owned subsidiary Kaya Brands International, Inc. KBI to serve as the Company s
vehicle for expansion into worldwide cannabis markets. Between September of 2019 and March 31, 2024 KBI has formed majority-owned subsidiaries
in both Greece and Israel and its local operating subsidiaries have acquired interests in various licenses and entities. 

On December 13, 2022
the Company formed Fifth Dimension Therapeutics FDT ,
a Florida Corporation) to seek to provide psychedelic services to sufferers of treatment resistant mental health diseases such as depression,
PTSD and other mental health disorders. On January 3, 2023 the Oregon Health Authority (the OHA began to accept license
applications, allowing each entity to own and operate one (1) Psilocybin manufacturing and processing facility for the production of
Psilocybin Mushrooms and derived therapeutics Psilocybins ), and up to five (5) Psilocybin Facilitation Centers where clients
would go to ingest Psilocybins and experience effects under the supervision of State Licensed Facilitators. 

On January 25, 2023
the Company confirmed that attorney Glenn E.J. Murphy was welcomed as a founding member to the FDT Board of Directors. Glenn will assist
FDT with introductions to pharmaceutical companies seeking data and access to psychedelic patients, as well as advising on the development
of intellectual property, structure of potential joint ventures, funding opportunities, acquisitions, and other related endeavors. Glenn
has twenty-five years of private and corporate practice, including ten years in-house with the Henkel Group and more than fifteen years
in private practice, Glenn's experience has touched on most every aspect of intellectual property practice. 

On March 13, 2023,
Bryan Arnold (one of KAYS Vice Presidents and its longest serving Oregon Employee) completed his OHA Certified Psilocybin Education through
the Changra Institute and became one of the first eighteen graduates to obtain Psilocybin Facilitator certification in the State of Oregon.
Bryan s Facilitation License application has been approved by the OHA, and he now may oversee up to five (5) Psilocybin Treatment
Facilities and up to one (1) Psilocybin Production Facility. Additionally, the Company expects to enroll additional potential licensee
candidates within the coming months to bolster its ranks of OHA Licensed Psilocybin Facilitators as it moves forward with plans to open
its first Psilocybin Clinic, subject to completion of financing and regulatory approvals. 

On November 14, 2023
the Company filed a license application with the Oregon Department of Health (the OHA for the licensure of The Sacred
Mushroom , an approximately 11,000 square foot psilocybin treatment center located in Portland, Oregon which would serve as the
Company s flagship psilocybin facility. 

On
March 6, 2024, the OHA completed its Psilocybin Service Center License Inspection and itemized three (3) facility structural/layout items
that they wanted addressed/modified prior to issuing the facility license. On May 7, 2024, the Company had been awarded its license by
the Oregon Health Authority to operate its Portland, Oregon psilocybin treatment center, The Sacred Mushroom. On July 2, 2024, the
Company announced that
its licensed psilocybin treatment center, The Sacred Mushroom would open for business on July 5, 2024 and immediately commencing begin
administering psilocybin treatments to eligible guests. 

for
the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and net income of for
the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The net loss is due to the changes in derivative liabilities. At September 30, 2024 the
Company has a working capital deficiency of and
is totally dependent on its ability to raise capital. The Company has a plan of operations and acknowledges that its plan of
operations may not result in generating positive working capital in the near future. Even though management believes that it will be
able to successfully execute its business plan, which includes third-party financing and capital issuance, and meet the
Company s future liquidity needs, there can be no assurances in that regard. These matters raise substantial doubt about the
Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that
might result from the outcome of this material uncertainty. Management recognizes that the Company must generate additional funds to
successfully develop its operations and activities. Management plans include: 

the sale of additional
 equity and debt securities, 

alliances and/or partnerships
 with entities interested in and having the resources to support the further development of the Company s business plan, 

business transactions to
 assure continuation of the Company s development and operations, 

development of a unified
 brand and the pursuit of licenses to operate recreational and medical marijuana facilities under the branded name. 

and as of December 31, 2023. Inventory allowance and impairment were and as of September 30, 2024 and December 31,
2023, respectively. 

- years of the respective
assets. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. 

Upon sale or retirement
of property and equipment, the related cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any gain or loss is reflected
in the statements of operations. 

during the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to during the year ended December
31, 2022. Although we have net operating losses that we believe are available to us to offset this entire tax liability, which arises
under Section 280E of the Code because we are a cannabis company, as a conservative measure, we have accrued this liability.

The carrying amounts of the Company s
financial assets and liabilities, such as cash, prepaid expenses, other current assets, accounts payable accrued expenses, certain
notes payable and notes payable related party, approximate their fair values because of the short maturity of these instruments. 

The Company accounts
for its derivative liabilities, at fair value, on a recurring basis under level 3. See Note 7. 

The amendments in
Part 1 of this Update are a cost savings relative to former accounting. This is because, assuming the required criteria for equity classification
in Subtopic 815-40 are met, an entity that issued such an instrument no longer measures the instrument at fair value at each reporting
period (in the case of warrants) or separately accounts for a bifurcated derivative (in the case of convertible instruments) on the basis
of the existence of a down round feature. For convertible instruments with embedded conversion options that have down round features,
applying specialized guidance such as the model for contingent beneficial conversion features rather than bifurcating an embedded derivative
also reduces cost and complexity. Under that specialized guidance, the issuer recognizes the intrinsic value of the feature only when
the feature becomes beneficial instead of bifurcating the conversion option and measuring it at fair value each reporting period. 

The amendments in
Part II of this Update replace the indefinite deferral of certain guidance in Topic 480 with a scope exception. This has the benefit
of improving the readability of the Codification and reducing the complexity associated with navigating the guidance in Topic 480. 

The Company adopted
this new standard on January 1, 2019; however, the Company needs to continue the derivative liabilities due to variable conversion price
on some of the convertible instruments. As such, it did not have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements. 

Expected
 term of share options and similar instruments: The expected life of options and similar instruments
 represents the period of time the option and/or warrant are expected to be outstanding. Pursuant
 to Paragraph 718-10-50-2(f)(2)(i) of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification the expected
 term of share options and similar instruments represents the period of time the options and
 similar instruments are expected to be outstanding taking into consideration of the contractual
 term of the instruments and employees expected exercise and post-vesting employment
 termination behavior into the fair value (or calculated value) of the instruments. Pursuant
 to paragraph 718-10-S99-1, it may be appropriate to use the simplified method, i.e., expected
 term = ((vesting term + original contractual term) / 2), if (i) A company does not have sufficient
 historical exercise data to provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate expected term
 due to the limited period of time its equity shares have been publicly traded; (ii) A company
 significantly changes the terms of its share option grants or the types of employees that
 receive share option grants such that its historical exercise data may no longer provide
 a reasonable basis upon which to estimate expected term; or (iii) A company has or expects
 to have significant structural changes in its business such that its historical exercise
 data may no longer provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate expected term. The Company
 uses the simplified method to calculate expected term of share options and similar instruments
 as the company does not have sufficient historical exercise data to provide a reasonable
 basis upon which to estimate expected term. 

Expected
 volatility of the entity s shares and the method used to estimate it. Pursuant
 to ASC Paragraph 718-10-50-2(f)(2)(ii) a thinly-traded or nonpublic entity that uses the
 calculated value method shall disclose the reasons why it is not practicable for the Company
 to estimate the expected volatility of its share price, the appropriate industry sector index
 that it has selected, the reasons for selecting that particular index, and how it has calculated
 historical volatility using that index. The Company uses the average historical
 volatility of the comparable companies over the expected contractual life of the share options
 or similar instruments as its expected volatility. If shares of a company are
 thinly traded the use of weekly or monthly price observations would generally be more appropriate
 than the use of daily price observations as the volatility calculation using daily observations
 for such shares could be artificially inflated due to a larger spread between the bid and
 asked quotes and lack of consistent trading in the market. 

Expected
 annual rate of quarterly dividends. An entity that uses a method that employs
 different dividend rates during the contractual term shall disclose the range of expected
 dividends used and the weighted-average expected dividends. The expected dividend
 yield is based on the Company s current dividend yield as the best estimate of projected
 dividend yield for periods within the expected term of the share options and similar instruments. 

Risk-free
 rate(s). An entity that uses a method that employs different risk-free rates shall disclose
 the range of risk-free rates used. The risk-free interest rate is based on the
 U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for periods within the expected
 term of the share options and similar instruments. 

Generally, all forms of share-based payments,
including stock option grants, warrants and restricted stock grants and stock appreciation rights are measured at their fair value on
the awards grant date, based on estimated number of awards that are ultimately expected to vest. 

The expense resulting from share-based
payments is recorded in general and administrative expense in the statements of operations. 

The fair value of
share options and similar instruments is estimated on the date of grant using a Binomial option-pricing valuation model. The
ranges of assumptions for inputs are as follows: 

Expected
 term of share options and similar instruments: Pursuant to Paragraph 718-10-50-2(f)(2)(i)
 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification the expected term of share options and similar
 instruments represents the period of time the options and similar instruments are expected
 to be outstanding taking into consideration of the contractual term of the instruments and
 holder s expected exercise behavior into the fair value (or calculated value) of the
 instruments. The Company uses historical data to estimate holder s expected
 exercise behavior. If the Company is a newly formed corporation or shares of the
 Company are thinly traded the contractual term of the share options and similar instruments
 is used as the expected term of share options and similar instruments as the Company does
 not have sufficient historical exercise data to provide a reasonable basis upon which to
 estimate expected term. 

Expected
 volatility of the entity s shares and the method used to estimate it. Pursuant
 to ASC Paragraph 718-10-50-2(f)(2)(ii) a thinly-traded or nonpublic entity that uses the
 calculated value method shall disclose the reasons why it is not practicable for the Company
 to estimate the expected volatility of its share price, the appropriate industry sector index
 that it has selected, the reasons for selecting that particular index, and how it has calculated
 historical volatility using that index. The Company uses the average historical
 volatility of the comparable companies over the expected contractual life of the share options
 or similar instruments as its expected volatility. If shares of a company are
 thinly traded the use of weekly or monthly price observations would generally be more appropriate
 than the use of daily price observations as the volatility calculation using daily observations
 for such shares could be artificially inflated due to a larger spread between the bid and
 asked quotes and lack of consistent trading in the market. 

Expected
 annual rate of quarterly dividends. An entity that uses a method that employs
 different dividend rates during the contractual term shall disclose the range of expected
 dividends used and the weighted-average expected dividends. The expected dividend
 yield is based on the Company s current dividend yield as the best estimate of projected
 dividend yield for periods within the expected term of the share options and similar instruments. 

Risk-free
 rate(s). An entity that uses a method that employs different risk-free rates shall disclose
 the range of risk-free rates used. The risk-free interest rate is based on the
 U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for periods within the expected
 term of the share options and similar instruments.

Item 2. Management s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 

Business Overview 

PART I 

Item 1. Business. 

Overview 

Kaya Holdings, Inc
is a holding company focusing on wellness and mental health through operations in psychedelic treatment clinics, medical and recreational
cannabis, and CBD products. 

In 2014, KAYS became
the first US public company to own and operate a medical cannabis dispensary in the United States and has again broken ground with the
licensing and opening of The Sacred Mushroom Psychedelic Treatment Center. KAYS plans to operate The Sacred Mushroom as
part of its Fifth Dimension Therapeutics, Inc. subsidiary FDT ), which also plans to work cooperatively with select pharmaceutical
companies to maximize the curative and therapeutic potential of psilocybin. 

KAYS has approximately
ten years of operational experience as a vertically integrated legal cannabis enterprise and is the first U.S. publicly traded company
to operate a legal marijuana dispensary, as well as the first to vertically integrate by adding cultivation and manufacturing. During
the last ten years of cannabis operations the Company has produced, distributed, and/or sold a full range of premium cannabis products
including flower, oils, vape cartridges and cannabis infused confections, baked goods and beverages through a fully integrated group
of subsidiaries and companies supporting highly distinctive brands. 

In late 2019 the
Company determined that US Federal cannabis legalization was not something that would come to fruition anytime soon and began to explore
overseas opportunities for cannabis operations. The Company currently has one retail cannabis license in Oregon and two medical marijuana
production and processing licenses in Greece. 

In addition, we also
began looking at opportunities within the pending legalization of Psilocybin treatments in Oregon and their potential therapeutic value
for treatment-resistant mental health disorders. 

In November 2020,
Oregon became the first state in the United States to legalize and license the supervised use of psilocybin, and in January 2023 they
began accepting licensing applications for Oregon Health Authority (the OHA State Licensed Psilocybin Facilitators (OHA
licensed professionals to operate the clinics), and also for the licensing of Psilocybin Manufacturing and Testing operations and the
Facilitation clinics where clients can obtain Psilocybin Treatment Services. The OHA had also launched Oregon s medical cannabis
program in 2014, giving KAYS critical experience in comprehending and complying with OHA mandates, and sets the stage for KAYS First
Mover Advantage in the emerging US psychedelic therapeutics industry. 

On November 14, 2023,
the Company filed a license application with the OHA for the licensure of The Sacred Mushroom , an approximately 11,000 square
foot psychedelic treatment center located in Portland, Oregon which the Company intends to operate as its flagship psychedelic treatment
facility. 

On April 25, 2024
the Company received notice from the OHA that its license had been approved and we commenced operations on August 1, 2024. It is our
understanding is that we are the first US Public Company to own and operate a US based licensed Psychedelic Treatment Facility.

Our
Psychedelic Treatment Facility Plan and KAYS Fifth Dimension Therapeutics, Inc. Subsidiary 

On December 13, 2022
the Company formed Fifth Dimension Therapeutics FDT to seek to provide psychedelic "mind care"
treatments to veterans suffering from PTSD, addicts seeking to break addiction, individuals with eating disorders, and others with a
wide array of treatment resistant mental health disorders. 

On January 3, 2023
the OHA began to accept license applications, allowing each entity to own and operate one (1) Psilocybin manufacturing and processing
facility for the production of Psilocybin Mushrooms and derived therapeutics Psilocybins ), and up to five (5) Psilocybin
Facilitation Centers where clients would go to ingest Psilocybins and experience effects under the supervision of State Licensed Facilitators.
The OHA had also launched Oregon s medical cannabis program in 2014, giving KAYS critical experience in comprehending and complying
with OHA mandates. The psilocybin opportunity is a logical extension for Kaya Holdings. The purpose, customer, regulations, and operations,
as well as our familiarity with Oregon regulators, are synergistic with our current mission, and can be leveraged within our current
operational infrastructure. We anticipate being able to respond to market demand rapidly, upon licensing. The licenses issued in Oregon
are the first ever State Legal Licensing of Psilocybin Manufacturing and Treatment Centers, and KAYS is positioned to be first in line
due to its operating history in Oregon. 

On January 25, 2023
attorney Glenn E.J. Murphy became a founding member of the FDT Board of Directors. Mr. Murphy has agreed to assist FDT with introductions
to pharmaceutical companies seeking data and access to psychedelic patients, as well as advising on the development of intellectual property,
structure of potential joint ventures, funding opportunities, acquisitions, and other related endeavors. With more than 25 years of experience
in corporate legal practice (including both ten years in-house with the Henkel Group and more than 15 years in private practice), Mr.
Murphy s experience has touched on most every aspect of intellectual property practice. 

On March 13, 2023,
Bryan Arnold (one of KAYS Vice Presidents and its longest serving Oregon Employee) completed his OHA Certified Psilocybin Education through
the Changra Institute and became one of the first eighteen graduates to obtain Psilocybin Facilitator certification in the State of Oregon.
Bryan s Facilitation License application has been approved by the OHA, and he now may oversee up to five (5) Psilocybin Treatment
Facilities and up to one (1) Psilocybin Production Facility. Additionally, the Company expects to enroll additional potential licensee
candidates within the coming months to bolster its ranks of OHA Licensed Psilocybin Facilitators as it moves forward with plans to open
its first Psychedelic Treatment Center, subject to completion of financing and regulatory approvals. 

On November 14, 2023

The Science
of Psilocybin and Treatment Resistant Mental Health Issues 

Growing evidence
suggests that psychedelics act on the brain s default network, or those regions of the brain that remain active when your brain
is not engaged in active tasks. The default network provides a framework for the brain s activity, providing structure
and making order of all that is happening in the cortex and keeping external neurological information (delivered via our senses) distinct
from internally generated activity (thoughts, emotions, and memory). 

Psychedelics seem
to suppress the default network, relaxing the separation of our senses, memories, thoughts, and emotions, and enabling each to influence
each other more easily. This ability to break down the brain s framework has led to a focus on psychedelics as a
groundbreaking opportunity to address a wide range of mental health disorders. 

Psilocybin, a naturally
occurring compound found in magic mushrooms , is one of an emerging class of psychedelic medicines that contain potent psychoactive
chemicals that can serve to affect human perception, emotions, and other cognitive functions. Psychedelic medicines have been found to
have ground-breaking potential in treating a range of physical and mental disorders including anxiety and panic disorder, resistant depression,
opiate addiction, adult attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ADHD ), post-traumatic stress disorder PTSD ),
and acute and chronic pain. 

A 2020 study in the
Journal of the American Medical Association Psychiatry found that 71 of the patients with severe, previously treatment-resistant depression,
showed clinically significant improvement that lasted at least four weeks and with low potential for addiction
after treatment with Psilocybin. Speaking on the study one of the study s co-authors, Alan Davis, a neuroscience researcher at
Ohio State University and adjunct professor at the Johns Hopkins Center for Psychedelic and Consciousness Research stated, I would
say at this stage the research is showing that in safe settings, this provides relief from debilitating mental health problems for some
people. 

33 

It is estimated that
approximately 46.5 million American adults (18 battle an anxiety disorder such as Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and Panic Disorders,
24.5 million American adults (9.5 suffer from depressive illness (with someone committing suicide every 40 seconds), 17.3 million American
adults (6.7 have been diagnosed with Alcohol Use Disorder, 18.3 million American adults (7.1 are considered drug dependent, and 11.4
million American women (8.5 and 3 million American men (2.5 struggle with an eating disorder. All of these difficult to treat mental
health disorders have been shown by research to be aided by psychedelic treatment. 

Companies such as
Compass Pathways, ATAI Life Sciences, and Cybin are engaged in developing synthetic versions of psilocybin and psilocin (the active ingredient
in magic mushrooms to offer as breakthrough therapies for treatment resistant mental health disorders. As a Delivery
of Treatment provider, it is expected that The Sacred Mushroom and similar facilities will be the safe environment needed
for these emerging pharma-based psychedelic treatments. As these companies endure the costly, time consuming, and unpredictable path
to FDA approval, we believe that The Scared Mushroom will establish its position as a leader in the delivery of psychedelic care, offering
more immediate relief for people with pressing mental health conditions. 

Industry Treatment
Models 

A recent survey of
internet advertised psilocybin treatment prices in Oregon showed that initial prices for one facility range from 300 for a group microdose
session and pricing of 900 to 3,500 for an individual high-dose session, with another facility pricing first-time full dose treatments
at 15,000 (these prices do not include the cost of the psilocybin, which can run from 100 to 300). 

KAYS believes that
its facility offers a superior setting, broader activity and treatment options with pricing at or near the lower range, thereby enabling
us to deliver a superior treatment experience at a much lower price than the competition, while still achieving profitability. 

The Sacred
Mushroom Psychedelic Treatment Facility 

It has been shown
that Set and Setting are the keys to the successful psilocybin journeys. (Set as in mindset, Setting as in the place). With this in mind,
the curators at The Sacred Mushroom TSM carefully considered every detail to enable an extraordinary setting.
TSM provides guests access to psilocybin treatments in a spacious, comfortable, carefully controlled environment under licensure by the
OHA (OHA). 

Situated in downtown
Portland in Old Chinatown, The Sacred Mushroom is less than 30 minutes from Portland International Airport (PDX) and conveniently
accessible by public transportation. The Sacred Mushroom is seven floors above the city of Portland, with panoramic views of the
city skyline and Mount Hood. The Sacred Mushroom encompasses approximately 11,000 sq ft. and provides guests with access to private
treatment rooms, group session areas, and activity zones with movement, listening stations, journaling chairs, and art expression for
distinctive, effective, and positive psilocybin treatments. The setting and space are designed to deliver the ultimate in safe, comfortable,
and relaxing psychedelic treatments.

The Global
Psilocybin and Psychedelic Medicine Industry 

While Oregon is currently
the only State that has legalized Psilocybin for medical use with a regulatory framework in place to issue licenses for their manufacture
and sale, Denver Colorado, Santa Cruz and Oakland, California, Ann Arbor, Michigan, Washington D.C., and Seattle, Washington have all
decriminalized small quantities. Other activity in the U.S. include: 

The
 Connecticut legislature has begun the process toward legalizing Psilocybin centers for the treatment of veterans. Many veterans 
 groups are advocating making psychedelic treatments available for veterans, particularly those with PTSD. 

Texas,
 Utah, Maryland, and Washington State have set up task forces to study the medical use of psilocybin and have funded research to explore
 the effects of psilocybin on certain mental health conditions. 

Colorado
 and California have ballots initiatives pending that would legalize psilocybin. 

The
 New Jersey senate is considering a bill that would legalize psilocybin to treat certain disorders. 
 
 Internationally: 

The
 Canadian government has been sued by an advocate group to force the legalization of psilocybin and other psychedelics. 

Australia s
 medicines regulator, the Therapeutic Goods Administration, has down-scheduled MDMA and Psilocybin for controlled clinical used as
 part of psychotherapy in clinical settings. 

Psilocybin
 is legal to possess, sell, transport, and cultivate in Bahamas, Jamaica, Brazil, Nepal, Netherlands 
 (only
 as a truffle), and Samoa. Possession of psilocybin is legal in Austria, British Virgin Islands, Spain, and Portugal. 

Insight Ace Analytic,
an industry research firm, reports that the global psychedelic therapeutics market was valued at US 3.61 billion in 2021, and estimates
the market will reach US 8.31 billion by 2028, with a CAGR of 13.2 during the forecast period of 2022-2028. Other market estimates
include the research firm Research Markets estimate that the psychedelic drugs market will reach US 10.75 billion by 2027. 

As reported in the
Wall Street Journal, Venture Capitalist Brom Rector of Empath Ventures sees Psychedelics as a traditional biotech play,
with a high probability of failure but a potential upside of 10, 20, maybe 50 times. Additionally, he sees many of the infrastructure
companies for the industry as having a lot higher probability of becoming cash flow positive.

Cannabis Operations 

Kaya Family
of Brands 

During
the last 10 years of cannabis operations the Company has produced, distributed, and/or sold a full range of premium cannabis products
including flower, oils, vape cartridges and cannabis infused confections, baked goods and beverages through a fully integrated group
of subsidiaries and companies supporting highly distinctive brands. 

The Company
currently maintains an extensive genetic library of seeds for top strains of cannabis that it has assembled from its own grow operations
and other commercial sources which it intends to utilize to launch international grow operations in Greece and elsewhere.

Kaya Brands International 

In 2019 KAYS formed
Kaya Brands International, Inc. Kaya International or KBI ), to leverage its experience and expand into worldwide
cannabis markets. KBI s current initiative includes Greece, with additional areas under consideration. 

Kaya Farms Greece 

In September 2017,
the Greek government announced it would be legalizing medical cannabis, and less than a year later Greek leaders approved Law 4523 and
Joint Ministerial Decision No. 51483, which permitted farming and production of medical cannabis. In 2020 the Greek Parliament passed
legislation that further relaxed cannabis export regulations, now permitting the bulk export of cannabis flower. 

We have selected
Greece as the center of our European market activity because of its amenable cannabis regulations, favorable climate, affordable, capable
workforce, and the country s position as a major pharmaceutical center in Europe. 

As an EU nation Greece
opens up the entire European market (where legal) to KAYS flower and oils, and as permitted, the KAYS portfolio of brands. 

On January 11, 2021,
through a majority owned subsidiary of KBI, Kaya Farms Greece (or KFG and Greekkannabis GKC , an Athens
based cannabis company) executed an agreement for KBI to acquire 50 of GKC. The first 25 was acquired in January, 2021 and the remaining
25 was acquired in July, 2021. GKC s projects include two medical cannabis cultivation and processing projects in Greece- one
in Epidaurus, Greece and the other in Thebes, Greece. 

Additionally, on
November 8, 2021 KAYS/KBI through a majority owned subsidiary of KBI (Kaya Farms Greece or KFG executed an agreement to
acquire 50 of Greekkaya, a second medical Cannabis in Epidaurus, Greece. 

GKC has a development
license from the Greek authorities that was originally issued as part of a plan purchase and develop 15 acres in Thebes, Greece as a
large-scale cultivation production and processing project. However, GKC has elected to hold off on acquiring the land until such time
as European cannabis demand warrants the investment required to develop the project. 

The Epidaurus Project
consists of 2 connected industrial buildings (already constructed, approximately 50,000 square feet in total under-air space) situated
on 2.8 acres of land, with its own independent industrial electrical power center and ample water supply to service the needs of the
facility. The Epidaurus Project will include 25,000 square feet of indoor cannabis cultivation, a 15,000 square foot EU-GMP extraction
and processing facility, and a 10,000 square foot EU-GMP packing area. There is ample room for expansion with room to construct an additional
15,000 square feet on site. The joint venture is awaiting project financing and final license approval from Greek government authorities. 

Neither of the two subject Greece properties
are currently owned or optioned by GKC or its operating subsidiaries, but the land for the potential project in Epidaurus is owned by
one of our Greek partner s families and the land in Thebes is currently available for purchase or option. The Company believes
it could acquire either of the properties once funding and market conditions allow. Alternatively, both licenses are in good order, and
can be transferred to a new location pending Greek Government approval.

Government Regulation

We are subject to
general business regulations and laws, as well as regulations and laws directly applicable to our operations. As we continue to expand
the scope of our operations, the application of existing laws and regulations could include matters such as pricing, advertising, consumer
protection, quality of products, and intellectual property ownership. In addition, we will also be subject to new laws and regulations
directly applicable to our activities. 

While the State of
Oregon has created a regulatory framework through the Oregon Health Authority (OHA) that allows for the administration of psilocybin
to clients in OHA Licensed Psilocybin Treatment Facilities, the use and possession of Psilocybin is currently illegal under Federal Law. 

Any existing or new
legislation applicable to us could expose us to substantial liability, including significant expenses necessary to comply with such laws
and regulations, which could hinder or prevent the growth of our business. 

Federal, state and
local laws and regulations governing legal recreational and medical marijuana use are broad in scope and are subject to evolving interpretations,
which could require us to incur substantial costs associated with compliance. In addition, violations of these laws or allegations of
such violations could disrupt our planned business and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. In addition,
it is possible that additional or revised federal, state and local laws and regulations may be enacted in the future governing the legal
marijuana industry. There can be no assurance that we will be able to comply with any such laws and regulations and its failure to do
so could significantly harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

Our foreign operations
will also be subject to comparable government regulation in Greece and any other various foreign jurisdictions in which KAYS intends
to operate. 

Competition 

The legal marijuana
sector is rapidly growing and the Company faces significant competition in the operation of retail outlets and grow facilities. Many
of these competitors will have far greater experience, more extensive industry contacts and greater financial resources than the Company.
There can be no assurance that we can adequately compete to succeed in our business plan. 

The legal psychedelic
medicine sector is rapidly growing, and while the industry is at a much earlier stage than cannabis, the Company will also face significant
competition in the operation of retail outlets and grow facilities. Many of these competitors will have far greater experience, more
extensive industry contacts and greater financial resources than the Company. There can be no assurance that we can adequately compete
to succeed in our business plan. 

Employees 

As of the date as
of this Report, our Oregon operations have 2 full-time employees, consisting of Chad Craig, the Senior Vice President of Oregon Operations
and Bryan Arnold, Vice President of KAYS Subsidiary Fifth Dimension Therapeutics, Inc. and Lead Facilitator of the Sacred Mushroom Psychedelic
Treatment Center. Additionally, we engage several consultants to assist with daily duties and business implementation and execution.
Additional employees will be hired and other consultants engaged in the future as we execute our business plan.

Financing Transactions 

 On July 22, 2024, the Company received 125,000.00

private placement. 

 On September 13, 2024, the Company received
 125,000.00 of capital from the Institutional Investor. The 125,000 (along with 130,000 in interest and Principal that was owed the

Use
of Proceeds 

The proceeds from
financing transactions that the Company has and may enter into will be used for general working capital to fund our growth plan, including
the development of our Oregon psilocybin business and development of its international projects in Greece. 

Plan of Operations 

Management believes
that further proceeds expected to be received from financing transactions that it is seeking to enter into, combined with existing and
anticipated revenues, will alleviate the Company s financial difficulties to a significant extent and will allow the Company to
meet its anticipated working capital needs for a period of between twelve and eighteen months from the date of this report. However,
there can be no assurance that further funding from the contemplated financings will be achieved, or if achieved that they will be successful
to the level required to meet the Company s cash needs, or that management s belief will be correct and that the Company
will not sooner require additional financing to meet its working capital needs prior to achieving profitability or positive cash flow.
Moreover, we may not be successful in raising additional capital on commercially reasonable terms, if and when needed, in which case
our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.

Not applicable. 

Item 4. Controls
and Procedures 

Evaluation of
Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Under the direction
of our Chairman and President, who is our principal, executive, financial and accounting officer, we evaluated our disclosure controls
and procedures as of September 30, 2024. Our Chairman and President, who is our principal, executive, financial and accounting officer,
concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2024. 

We maintain disclosure
controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that the information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file under the
Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and
that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chairman and President, who is our principal,
executive, financial and accounting officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. In designing and
evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed
and operated, can only provide reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and in reaching a reasonable level of
assurance, management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls
and procedures. 

57 

As required by SEC
Rule 13a-15(b), we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chairman
and President, who is our principal, executive, financial and accounting officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of
our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of our fourth fiscal quarter covered by this report. Based on the foregoing, our
Chairman and President concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective. It should be noted that the design of
any system of controls is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance
that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions, regardless of how remote. 

Management s
Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

Our management of
is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting
is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, our
Chairman and President, who is our principal, executive, financial and accounting officer and effected by the Company s board of
directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation
of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies
and procedures that: 

Pertain
 to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets
 of the Company; 

Provide
 reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with
 generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with
 authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and 

Provide
 reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company s
 assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 

Because of
its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation
of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

The Company s
Chairman and President, who is our principal, executive, financial and accounting officer, assessed the effectiveness of the Company s
internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2024.. In making this assessment, the Company s Chairman and President,
who is our principal, executive, financial and accounting officer, used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations
of the Treadway Commission COSO in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013). The COSO framework is based upon five
integrated components of control: control environment, risk assessment, control activities, information and communications and ongoing
monitoring. 

Based on the assessment
performed, the Company s Chairman and President, who is our principal, executive, financial and accounting officer, has concluded
that the Company s internal control over financial reporting, as of September 30, 2023. is not effective to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of its financial reporting and the preparation of its financial statements in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles. Further, the Company s Chairman and President, who is our principal, executive, financial and accounting
officer, has identified material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2024. 

58 

Based on an evaluation,
the Company s Chairman and President, who is our principal, executive, financial and accounting officer, has concluded that the
Company s disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act were not effective
as of September 30, 2024. (the Evaluation Date ), to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in
reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified
in the Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms; and (ii) accumulated and communicated to the Company s Chairman and
President, who is our principal, executive, financial and accounting officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure. Each of the following is deemed a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting: 

We
 do not have an audit committee. While we are not currently obligated to have an audit committee, including a member who
 is an audit committee financial expert, as defined in Item 407 of Regulation S-K, under applicable regulations or listing
 standards; however, it is management s view that such a committee is an important internal control over financial reporting,
 the lack of which may result in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of internal controls and procedures. 

We
 did not maintain proper segregation of duties for the preparation of our financial statements. We currently have only
 one officer overseeing all transactions. This has resulted in several deficiencies, including the lack of control over
 preparation of financial statements and proper application of accounting policies 

Lack of controls over related party transactions: As of September 30, 2024, the Company did not establish a formal written policy for the approval,
 identification and authorization of related party transactions. 

The Company s
Chairman and President, who is our principal, executive, financial and accounting officer, believes that the material weaknesses set
forth in the two items above did not have an effect on our financial results. However, the Company s Chairman and President, who
is our principal, executive, financial and accounting officer, believes that the lack of a functioning audit committee results in ineffective
oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and financial procedures, which could result in a material
misstatement in our consolidated financial statements in future periods. 

 Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There was no change
in our internal controls or in other factors that could affect these controls during the first quarter of the year ended September 30,
2024 that have materially or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.
