par value per share (the Class B Common stock ),
from million shares to million shares in order to effect the conversion of each outstanding share of Class C common stock, 
par value per share (the Class C common stock ), into one-third of one share of Class B common stock, (ii) increase the
number of authorized shares of Class A common stock from million shares to million shares, and (iii) eliminate references to
the Class C common stock. Pursuant to the terms of an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of March 31, 2021 (the Merger Agreement with KushCo, immediately prior to the consummation of the business combination, holders of Class C common stock received one-third of
one share of Class B common stock for each share of Class C common stock held immediately prior to the closing of the merger. 

Our
corporate structure is commonly referred to as an Up-C structure. The Up-C structure allows the Operating Company to continue
to realize tax benefits associated with owning interests in an entity that is treated as a partnership, or pass-through 
entity. One of these benefits is that future taxable income of the Operating Company that is allocated to its members will be taxed on
a flow-through basis and therefore will not be subject to corporate taxes at the Operating Company entity level. Additionally, because
a member may redeem their Common Units for shares of Class A common stock on a one-for-one basis or, at our option, for cash, the Up-C
structure also provides the member with potential liquidity that holders of non-publicly traded limited liability companies are not typically
afforded. 

In
connection with the IPO, we entered into a Tax Receivable Agreement (the TRA with the Operating Company and the Operating
Company s members and a Registration Rights Agreement (the Registration Rights Agreement with the Operating Company s
members. The TRA provides for the payment by us to the Operating Company s member(s) of of the amount of tax benefits, if
any, that we may actually realize (or in some cases, are deemed to realize) as a result of (i) the step-up in tax basis in our share
of the Operating Company s assets resulting from the redemption of Common Units under the mechanism described above and (ii) certain
other tax benefits attributable to payments made under the TRA. Pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement, we have agreed to register
the resale of shares of Class A common stock that are issuable to the Operating Company s members upon redemption or exchange of
their Common Units. 

The
A R Charter and the Fourth Amended and Restated Operating Agreement of the Operating Company (the Operating Agreement require that (a) we at all times maintain a ratio of one Common Unit owned by us for each share of our Class A common stock issued by
us (subject to certain exceptions), and (b) the Operating Company at all times maintains (i) a one-to-one ratio between the number of
shares of our Class A common stock issued by us and the number of Common Units owned by us, and (ii) a one-to-one ratio between the number
of shares of our Class B common stock owned by the non-founder members of the Operating Company and the number of Common Units owned
by the non-founder members of the Operating Company. 

As
of December 31, 2022, all Common Units of the Operating Company and Class B common stock had been exchanged for Class A common stock,
and we owned of the voting and economic interests in Greenlane through the holders ownership of Class A common stock. See
 Note 9 - Stockholder s Equity. 

Reverse
Stock Splits 

On
June 2, 2023, we filed a Certificate of Amendment to the A R Charter with the Secretary of State for the State of Delaware SSSD ),
which effected a one-for-ten reverse stock split (the 2023 Reverse Stock Split and together with the 2022 Reverse Stock
Split, the Reverse Stock Splits of our issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock at 5:01 PM Eastern Time on June 5,
2023. As a result of the 2023 Reverse Stock Split, every ten shares of common stock issued and outstanding were converted into one share
of common stock. We paid cash in lieu of fractional shares, and accordingly, no fractional shares were issued in connection with the
2023 Reverse Stock Split. 

On
July 23, 2024, the Board approved the reverse split at a ratio of one-for-11 and the Amendment has been filed with the Secretary of State
of the State of Delaware, which became effective on August 5, 2024 at 12:01 AM Eastern Time, before the opening of trading on the Nasdaq. 

The
Reverse Stock Splits did not change the par value of the Common Stock or the authorized number of shares of Common Stock. All outstanding
options, restricted stock awards, warrants and other securities entitling their holders to purchase or otherwise receive shares of our
Common Stock have been adjusted as a result of the Reverse Stock Splits, as required by the terms of each security. The number of shares
available to be awarded under our Amended and Restated 2019 Equity Incentive Plan have also been appropriately adjusted. See Note
10 Compensation Plans for more information. 

All
share and per share amounts in these consolidated financial statements and notes thereto have been retroactively adjusted for all periods
presented to give effect to the Reverse Stock Splits, including reclassifying an amount equal to the reduction in par value of Common
Stock to additional paid-in capital. 

Liquidity
and Going Concern 

Pursuant
to ASC 205-40, Presentation of Financial Statements Going Concern ASC 205-40 ), management must evaluate whether
there are conditions and events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue
as a going concern for one year after the date that these condensed consolidated financial statements are issued. In accordance with
ASC 205-40, management s analysis can only include the potential mitigating impact of management s plans that have not been
fully implemented as of the issuance date if (a) it is probable that management s plans will be effectively implemented on a timely
basis, and (b) it is probable that the plans, when implemented, will alleviate the relevant conditions or events that raise substantial
doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. 

Our
primary requirements for liquidity and capital are working capital, debt service related to recent acquisitions and general corporate
needs. Our primary sources of liquidity are our cash on hand and the cash flow that we generate from our operations, as well as proceeds
from other equity issuances. 

We
believe that our cash on hand and the cash flow that we generate from our operations will not be sufficient to fund our working capital
and capital expenditure requirements, as well as our debt repayments and other liquidity requirements associated with our existing operations,
for the next 12 months. Based on our cash on hand and working capital at September 30, 2024, we may have insufficient cash to fund planned
operations into the fourth quarter of 2024. This is evident from our continued efforts to raise capital and leverage external funding
to fulfil our capital needs. 

ATM
Program and Shelf Registration Statement 

We
formerly used a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (the Shelf Registr ation
Statement to conduct securities offerings from time to time in order to meet our liquidity needs. In August 2021, we filed a
prospectus supplement and established an at-the-market equity offering program (the ATM Program that provided
for the sale of shares of our Class A common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to million, from time to time. 

Since
the launch of the ATM program in August 2021 and through December 31, 2022, we sold shares of our Class A common stock which generated
gross proceeds of approximately million and we paid fees to the sales agent of approximately million. Due to the untimely
filing of certain of our Quarterly and Annual Reports, we are unable to issue additional shares of Class A common stock pursuant to the
ATM Program or otherwise use the Shelf Registration Statement, which will limit our liquidity options in the capital markets. 

Common
Stock and Warrant Offerings. 

On
June 29, 2023, we entered into securities purchase agreements with certain investors, pursuant to which we agreed to issue and sell an
aggregate of shares of our Class A common stock, pre-funded warrants to purchase up to shares of our Class A Common
Stock (the July 2023 Pre-Funded Warrants and warrants to purchase up to shares of our Class A common stock (the
 July 2023 Standard Warrants ). The July 2023 units were offered pursuant to a Registration Statement on Form S-1 (the July
2023 Offering ). The July 2023 Offering generated gross proceeds of approximately million and net proceeds to the Company
of approximately million and closed on July 3, 2023. See Note 9 Stockholders Equity for further information. 

On August 12, 2024, the Company entered into a securities
purchase agreement with a single institutional investor for aggregate gross cash proceeds of million. In connection with the private
placement, the Company will issue an aggregate of units and pre-funded units. The pre-funded units will be sold at the same
purchase price as the units, less the pre-funded warrant exercise price of . Each unit and pre-funded unit will consist of one
share of common stock (or one pre-funded warrant) and two common warrants, each exercisable for one share of common stock at an exercise
price of per share. 

Asset-Based
Loan 

On
August 9, 2022, we entered into an asset-based loan agreement dated as of August 8, 2022 (the Loan Agreement ), which made
available to the Company a term loan of up to million. On February 9, 2023, we entered into Amendment No. 2 to the Loan Agreement,
in which we agreed to, among other things, voluntarily prepay approximately million (inclusive of early termination fees and expenses)
under the terms provided for under the Loan Agreement and the lenders under the Loan Agreement agreed to release million in funds
held in a blocked account pursuant to the terms of the Loan Agreement. 

On
August 7, 2023, we repaid the approximately million in aggregate principal amount (the Loan Repayment which remained
outstanding under the terms of the Loan Agreement. As a result of the Loan Repayment, the Company has been released from its obligations
under the Loan Agreement, in accordance with the terms of the Loan Agreement. See Note 6 - Long Term Debt for more information. 

ERC
Sale 

On
February 16, 2023, two of our wholly owned subsidiaries, Warehouse Goods LLC and Kim International LLC, entered into an agreement with
a third-party institutional investor pursuant to which the investor purchased, for approximately million in cash, an economic participation
interest, at a discount, in our rights to payment from the United States Internal Revenue Service for certain periods with respect to
the employee retention credits filed by us under the Employee Retention Credit program. 

Future
Receivables Financing 

In
July, August, October, and November 2023, the Company received an aggregate of approximately million in cash pursuant to the terms
of future receivables financings (collectively, the Future Receivables Financings entered into with two private lenders.
At September 30, 2024, million of such financing remained outstanding. See Note 6 - Long Term Debt for more information. 

Secured
Bridge Loan 

On
September 22, 2023, the Company entered into a secured loan pursuant to a Loan and Security Agreement (the September 2023 Loan
Agreement ), dated as of September 22, 2023 with Synergy Imports, LLC (the Secured Bridge Loan Lender ). 

Pursuant
to the September 2023 Loan Agreement, the Secured Bridge Loan Lender agreed to make available to the Company a six -month bridge loan
of million in new funds. Additionally, the Secured Bridge Loan Lender agreed to defer payments totaling already owed
by the Company under existing payment obligations and potentially defer up to an additional which may become due pursuant
to existing agreements during the term of the September 2023 Loan Agreement. 

Subject
to certain exceptions, the Company agreed to pledge all of its assets, with the exception of deposit accounts and accounts receivable,
as collateral. Additionally, the Company agreed to transfer one US patent and two related foreign patents and a related trademark in
exchange for an exclusive license back of such assets in the area of smoking products and accessories in connection with the September
2023 Loan Agreement. 

In
May 2024, the Company modified its debt agreement with Synergy to reduce the principal balance due by million from million
as part of the Loan Modification Agreement concurrent with the Asset Purchase Agreement. Synergy acquired certain assets from the Company
in exchange for the reduction in overall principal owed. At September 30, 2024, million of such financing remained outstanding.
See Note 6 - Long Term Debt for more information. 

Note
Payable 

On
June 7, 2024, the Company entered into a subscription agreement with Cobra Alternative Capital Strategies, LLC. As of September 30,
2024, the Company has been loaned 
million with net cash proceeds of 
million. The note was issued with a 
original issue discount and is due in full on . See Note 6 - Long Term Debt for more information. During the three months ended September 30, 2024,
the Company repaid 
million and the remaining outstanding balance was approximately 
million. The Company has elected to measure these notes using the fair value option under ASC 825, Financial Instruments.
Given the short-term duration of the notes, the carrying value of the notes at September 30, 2024 approximate the fair value and as such
no fair value adjustment was recorded in the statement of operations. 

Management
Initiatives 

We
have completed several initiatives to optimize our working capital requirements due to our inability to access capital markets on equitable
terms and stock-outs and shortages of higher velocity inventory. In the fourth quarter of 2022, we launched Groove, a new, innovative
Greenlane Brands product line, and we also rationalized and improved our third-party brands product offering, which enabled us to reduce
inventory carrying costs and working capital requirements while increasing our offerings. 

In
April 2023, we entered into two 
 strategic partnerships. First, we entered into a strategic
partnership (the MJ Packaging Partnership with A A Global Imports d/b/a MarijuanaPackaging.com MJ Pack ),
a leading provider of packaging solutions to the cannabis industry. On August 8, 2024 the Company terminated its strategic partnership
with MJ Packaging and is resuming its business as a direct provider of packaging solutions to the cannabis industry. MJ Packaging
however, remains a distribution customer of the Company. 

Second, we entered into a strategic partnership with an affiliate of one of our existing vape suppliers Vape Partner to service certain key customers with vaporizer goods and services (the Vape Partnership ). As part of the Vape Partnership,
we will introduce our Vape Partner to certain key customers, assist with the promotion and the sale of certain vaporizer goods and services,
and help coordinate the logistics, storage and distribution of such vaporizer products. If our Vape Partner and key customer(s) enter
into a direct relationship, the customers would directly purchase vaporizer goods and services, which we currently sell them, directly
from our Vape Partner and we would no longer need to purchase such vape inventory on behalf of such key customer(s). In exchange we would
earn quarterly and annual commission payments from our strategic partner. While the strategic partnership may result in a decrease
in top line revenue for these vape products, this partnership combined with some of our other restructuring initiatives
should allow us to reduce our overall cost-structure and enhance our margins, thereby improving our balance sheet. 

We
have successfully renegotiated many of our vendor and supplier partnership terms and are continuing to improve working capital arrangements
with our vendors and suppliers. We have made progress consolidating and streamlining our office, warehouse, and distribution operations
footprint. We have reduced our workforce significantly to reduce costs and align with our revenue projections. 

The
Company has incurred net losses of million and million for
the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, cash (used in)
provided by operating activities were ) million and million, respectively. The recent macroeconomic environment has caused weaker
demand than contemplated under the Company s business plan, resulting in a reduction in projected revenue and cash flows for the
twelve-month period included in the going concern evaluation. 

As
a result of our losses and our projected cash needs, combined with our current liquidity level, substantial doubt exists about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company s ability to continue as a going concern
is contingent upon successful execution
of management s intended plan over the next twelve months to improve the Company s liquidity and profitability, which includes,
without limitation: 

Further
 reducing operating costs expense by taking additional restructuring actions to align cost with revenue to achieve profitability. 

Increasing
 revenue by introducing new products, acquiring new customers, and enhancing our sales force 

Execute

Seeking

is placed by a customer. We typically complete these orders within one to six months from the date of order, depending on the complexity
of the customization and the size of the order, but the completion timeline can vary by product type and terms of sales with each customer.
See Note 8 Supplemental Financial Statement Information for a summary of changes to our customer deposits liability
balance during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and the year ended December 31, 2023. 

We
estimate product returns based on historical experience and record them as a refund liability that reduces the net sales for the period.
We analyze actual historical returns, current economic trends and changes in order volume when evaluating the adequacy of our sales returns
allowance in any reporting period. Our liability for returns, which is included within Accrued expenses and other current liabilities 
in our consolidated balance sheet, was approximately million December 31, 2023. There were liabilities related to refunds as
of September 30, 2024. 

We
elected to account for shipping and handling expenses that occur after the customer has obtained control of products as a fulfillment
activity in cost of sales. Shipping and handling fees charged to customers are included in net sales upon completion of our performance
obligations. We apply the practical expedient provided for by the applicable revenue recognition guidance by not adjusting the transaction
price for significant financing components for periods less than one year. We also apply the practical expedient provided by the applicable
revenue recognition guidance based upon which we generally expense sales commissions when incurred because the amortization period is
one year or less. Sales commissions are recorded within Salaries, benefits and payroll tax expenses in the consolidated
statements of operations and comprehensive loss. 

The
Company transitioned to a commission revenue model for the majority of the sales for the Industrial segment. The company operates as
a sales agent servicing vape customers and receives a commission for these services. The company was previously working directly with
these customers and recognizing gross revenue versus straight commission revenue. The Company recognizes this fee on a periodic basis
when the products have been shipped for the end consumer. In working with their partner, the Company is not responsible for fulfilling
a promise to provide the specified goods, does not establish the pricing with its partners customers, and does not have control over
the goods that will be shipped. As such, the Company is an agent and recognizes its revenue on a net basis for its service. The partner
company pays Greenlane a negotiated percentage-based fee on a quarterly basis.

Pursuant
to the purchase and sale agreement by which we acquired our European subsidiaries, the sellers are required to indemnify us against certain
specified matters and losses, including any and all liabilities, claims, penalties and costs incurred or sustained by us in connection
with non-compliance with tax laws in relation to activities of the sellers. The indemnity (or indemnification receivable) is limited
to an amount equal to the purchase price under the purchase and sale agreement. 

As
noted above, we have voluntarily disclosed VAT owed to several relevant tax authorities in the EU member states and believe in doing
so we will reduce our liability for penalties and interest. Nonetheless, we may incur expenses in future periods related to such matters,
including litigation costs and other expenses to defend our position. The outcome of such matters is inherently unpredictable and subject
to significant uncertainties. Refer to Note 7 Commitments and Contingencies for additional discussion regarding our
contingencies. 

The
amendments in this Update require that entities on an annual basis (1) disclose specific categories in the rate reconciliation and (2)
provide additional information for reconciling items that meet a quantitative threshold (if the effect of those reconciling items is
equal to or greater than 5 percent of the amount computed by multiplying pretax income (or loss) by the applicable statutory income tax
rate). In addition, public business entities are required to provide certain qualitative disclosure about the rate reconciliation. 

The

not provide us with significant influence over the operations of these investments. Accordingly, we account for our investments in these
entities as equity securities. 

Airgraft
Inc., Sun Grown, and VIVA are private entities and their equity securities do not have a readily determinable fair value. We elected
to measure these securities under the measurement alternative election at cost minus impairment, if any, with adjustments through earnings
for observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or similar investment of the same issuer. We acquired our investments
in Sun Grown and VIVA as part of our merger with KushCo, which we completed in August 2021. We did not identify any fair value adjustments
related to these equity securities during the three and nine months ended September 30 , 2024

Non-Controlling
Interest

discussed in Note 1 Business Operations and Organization , we consolidate the financial results of the Operating Company
in our consolidated financial statements and report a non-controlling interest related to the Common Units held by non-controlling interest
holders. As of December 31, 2022, all Common Units of the Operating Company and Class B common stock had been exchanged for Class A common
stock, and we owned of the economic interests in the Operating Company. The non-controlling interest in the accompanying consolidated

Company previously held by the non-controlling holders of Common Units calculated based on the weighted average non-controlling interests 
ownership during the periods presented. 

At-the-Market
Equity Offering

August 2021, we established an at-the-market equity offering program (the ATM Program that provides for
the sale of shares of our Class A common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to million, from time to time, through Cowen
and Company, LLC Cowen ), as the sales agent. Net proceeds from sales of our shares of Class A common stock under the ATM
Program are expected to be used for working capital and general corporate purposes. 

Sales
of our Class A common stock under the ATM Program may be made by means of transactions that are deemed to be an at the market
offering as defined in Rule 415(a)(4) under the Securities Act, including sales made directly on the Nasdaq Capital Market or
sales made to or through a market maker or through an electronic communications network. We are under no obligation to offer and sell
shares of our Class A common stock under the ATM Program. 

Shares
of our Class A common stock will be issued pursuant to our effective shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-257654),

exceeding more than one-third of the Company s public float (the market value of the Company s Class A common
stock and any other equity securities that it issues in the future that are held by non-affiliates) in any twelve-month period so long
as the Company s public float remains below million. 

On
April 18, 2022, we entered into Amendment No. 1 (the ATM Amendment to the sales agreement dated August 2, 2022 with Cowen.

to the untimely filing of our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended March 31, 2023 we are unable to issue additional
shares of Class A common stock pursuant to the ATM Program or otherwise use the Shelf Registration Statement for a period of 12 months,

On
June 2, 2023, the Company s stockholders approved a third amendment and restatement of the 2019 Plan (the Third Amended

In the event that management determines that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of their net
recorded amount, an adjustment to the valuation allowance will be made, which would reduce December the provision for income taxes. 

Uncertain
Tax Positions 

For
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, we did t have any unrecognized tax benefits as a result
of tax positions taken during a prior period or during the current period. interest or penalties have been recorded as a result of
tax uncertainties. The Company is subject to audit examination for federal and state purposes for the years 2019 2023. As of
the date these financial statements were issued, there were not any ongoing income tax audits. 

Tax
Receivable Agreement (TRA) 

We
entered into the TRA with the Operating Company and each of the members (other than Greenlane Holdings, Inc.) that provides for the payment
by the Operating Company to the members of of the amount of tax benefits, if any, that we may actually realize (or in some circumstances
are deemed to realize) as a result of (i) increases in tax basis resulting from any future redemptions of Common Units as described in
 Note 1 Business Operations and Organization and (ii) certain other tax benefits attributable to payments made under
the TRA. 

The
annual tax benefits are computed by calculating the income taxes due, including such tax benefits, and the income taxes due without such
benefits. The Operating Company expects to benefit from the remaining of any tax benefits that it may actually realize. The TRA payments
are not conditioned upon any continued ownership interest in the Operating Company. The rights of each noncontrolling interest holder
under the TRA are assignable to transferees of its interest in the Operating Company. The timing and amount of aggregate payments due
under the TRA may vary based on a number of factors, including the amount and timing of the taxable income the Operating Company generates
each year and the applicable tax rate. 

As
noted above, we evaluated the realizability of the deferred tax assets resulting from the IPO and the related transactions completed
in April 2019 and established a full valuation allowance against those benefits. As a result, we determined that the amount or timing
of payments to noncontrolling interest holders under the TRA are no longer probable or reasonably estimable. Based on this assessment,
our TRA liability was as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 

If
utilization of the deferred tax assets subject to the TRA becomes more likely than not in the future, we will record a liability related
to the TRA, which would be recognized as expense within our condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive (loss)
income. 

During
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, we did not make any payments, inclusive of interest, to members
of the Operating Company pursuant to the TRA.

Overview 

Founded
in 2005, Greenlane is the premier global platform for the development and distribution of premium cannabis accessories, vape devices,
and lifestyle products. In 2021, we completed several acquisitions along with a transformative merger with KushCo Holdings, adding a
significant industrial line of business to the Greenlane platform. These acquisitions strengthened our leading position as a consumer
ancillary products business and significantly expanded our customer network, bringing strategic relationships with leading cannabis multi-state-operators MSOs ), cannabis single-state operators SSOs ), and Canadian licensed-producers LPs ). Greenlane
is a leading ancillary cannabis company, providing a wide array of consumer ancillary products and industrial ancillary products to thousands
of cannabis producers, processors, brands, and retailers related Cannabis Operators ), in addition to specialty retailers,
smoke shops and head shops, convenience stores, and consumers directly through our own proprietary web stores and large online marketplaces
such as Amazon. 

We
have been developing a world-class portfolio of our own proprietary brands (the Greenlane Brands and carefully curated
third-party products that we believe will, over time, deliver higher margins and create long-term value for our customers and shareholders.
Our wholly-owned Greenlane Brands includes our recently launched more affordable product line Groove, innovative silicone pipes
and accessories and premium ancillary product brand Higher Standards. We also have category exclusive licenses for the premium
Marley Natural branded products, as well as the K. Haring Glass Collection. 

Since
the end of 2021, the Company has invested significantly in technology, including its e-commerce platforms, internal ERP systems, and
B2B capabilities. Our world-class product portfolio is offered to customers through our proprietary, owned and operated e-commerce platforms
which include Vapor.com, PuffItUp.com, HigherStandards.com, MarleyNaturalShop.com and Wholesale.Greenlane.com. These platforms allow
us to reach customers directly with helpful resources and a seamless purchasing experience. 

We
merchandise vaporizers, packaging, and other ancillary products in the United States, Canada, Europe and Latin America. We distribute
products to retailers through wholesale operations and distribute products to consumers through our e-commerce platforms We operate our
own distribution centers in the United States, while also utilizing third-party logistics 3PL locations in Canada. We
have made tremendous progress consolidating and streamlining our warehouse and distribution operations over the last two years. 

We
manage our business in two different, but complementary, business segments. The first is the Consumer Goods segment, which focuses on
serving consumers across wholesale, retail, and e-commerce operations offering both our Greenlane Brands as well as ancillary products
and accessories from select leading third-party brands, such as Storz and Bickel, Grenco Science, PAX, Arizer and more. The Consumer
Goods segment forms a central part of our growth strategy, especially as it relates to scaling our own portfolio of higher-margin proprietary
owned brands. In addition to our Consumer Goods segment, we have our Industrial Goods segment, which focuses on serving Cannabis Operators
by providing ancillary products essential to their daily operations and growth, such as packaging and vaporization solutions, including
our Greenlane Brand Pollen Gear. Refer to Note 12 Segment Reporting within this Form 10-Q for additional information
on our reportable segments.

Plan
to Accelerate Path to Profitability and Capitalize the Business 

In
today s economic landscape, particularly within the cannabis industry, achieving profitability and preserving working capital are
paramount. At Greenlane, we are intensely focused on making our business profitable and well-capitalized for long-term sustainability.
Our key initiatives include: 

1. 
 Technology
 Enhancements: We remain fully committed to improving our technology, particularly our B2B and e-commerce platforms, to provide a
 seamless shopping experience for our wholesale and retail customers. 

2. 
 Facility
 Footprint Rationalization: In 2023 and 2024, we optimized our facilities footprint by reducing warehouse and office space while increasing
 operational efficiency and improving fulfillment practices. The full benefit of those efforts are expected to be realized in 2024.

3. 
 Headcount
 Reduction: We have significantly reduced our headcount and associated salary expenses, focusing on maintaining a core group of key
 employees as we collectively right-size the business. 

4. 
 Cost
 Structure Optimization: We continue to reduce our overall cost structure while improving margins. In April 2023, we formed two strategic
 partnerships (described below in greater detail) to increase margins and significantly reduce working capital requirements in our
 Industrial Goods segment. Similarly, our Consumer Goods segment restructured arrangements with several third-party brands in 2022
 and 2023 to reduce our working capital needs. 

5. 
 Inventory
 Management: In 2023, we implemented a new inventory management and lifecycle strategy that is focused on a quarterly turn and a regular
 review of inventory to avoid future write-offs. 

6. 
 Sales
 Force Upgrade: We have upgraded and will continue to upgrade our sales force from a solely account management centric team to a skilled
 and driven sales team to acquire new customers while maintaining excellent service with our existing customers 

7. 
 Product
 Innovation: We launched Groove, an innovative new product line with a value-based price point and in 2024 we have begun to expand
 our product offering to further enhance our assortment available to our customers. 

8. 
 Capital
 Investment: We continue to seek opportunities for securing investment capital to leverage our platform, increase availability and
 reduce stockouts of our high demand third-party brands, invest in marketing and sales, and improve our product offerings. 

Management
believes that these initiatives will significantly reduce costs, help accelerate the Company s path to profitability, support business
growth, and allow the Company to reinvest capital into its highest demand and highest potential product lines. 

During
2023 and 2024, the Company received capital from various sources permitting it to right-size the business and position the company for
growth. Such sources are described in greater detail in the Liquidity and Capital Resources Section of this report. 

During
2023 and 2024, the Company also entered into certain arrangements to reduce working capital requirements and improve its balance sheet. 

In
April 2023, we entered into two strategic partnerships. First, we entered into a strategic partnership (the MJ Packaging
Partnership with A A Global Imports d/b/a MarijuanaPackaging.com MJ Pack ), a leading provider of
packaging solutions to the cannabis industry. On August 8, 2024 the Company terminated its strategic partnership with MJ Packaging
and is resuming its business as a direct provider of packaging solutions to the cannabis industry. MJ Packaging however,
remains a distribution customer of the Company. Second, we entered into a strategic partnership with an affiliate of one of our
existing vape suppliers Vape Partner to service certain key customers with vaporizer goods and services (the
 Vape Partnership ). As part of the Vape Partnership, we will introduce our Vape Partner to certain key customers,
assist with the promotion and the sale of certain vaporizer goods and services, and help coordinate the logistics, storage and
distribution of such vaporizer products. If our Vape Partner and key customer(s) enter into a direct relationship, the customers
would directly purchase vaporizer goods and services, which we currently sell them, directly from our Vape Partner and we would no
longer need to purchase such vape inventory on behalf of such key customer(s). In exchange we would earn quarterly and annual
commission payments from our strategic partner. While the strategic partnership may result in a decrease in top line revenue for
these vape products, this partnership combined with some of our other restructuring initiatives should allow us to
reduce our overall cost-structure and enhance our margins, thereby improving our balance sheet. 

28 

On
May 6, 2024, the Company, Warehouse Goods and Synergy entered into an asset purchase agreement, dated May 1, 2024 (the Asset Purchase
Agreement pursuant to which Synergy purchased all of the intellectual property, a specified amount of inventory, and other assets
related to the Eyce and DaVinci brands. In consideration for the acquisition, all parties entered into a loan modification agreement,
effective May 1, 2024 (the Loan Modification Agreement and an amended and restated secured promissory note, effective
May 1, 2024 (the Amended and Restated Secured Promissory Note ), an amendment to the original Eyce and Davinci Asset Purchase
Agreements, a distribution agreement, the termination of a license granted by Eyce, and the termination of certain consulting and employment
agreements. As part of the overall modification, the principal balance with Synergy decreased by 2.7 million from 5.1 million. Synergy
acquired certain assets from the Company in exchange for the reduction in overall principal owed and as part of the transaction, the
Company recognized a gain on the debt modification of 2.2 million. This amount is included in the accompanying financial statements
within the statement of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 within other income (expense). At September 30, 2024,
 2.7 million of such financing remained outstanding. As of the filing date of this statement and as a result of restructuring
efforts, the maturity of this note is October 2025. 

USPS
PACT Act Exemption 

On
January 11, 2022, we announced via press release that the United States Postal Service (the USPS had approved our application
for a business and regulatory exemption to the PACT Act (with respect to the business and regulatory exemption granted by the USPS, the
 PACT Act Exemption ), allowing us to ship vaporizers and accessories classified as electronic nicotine delivery systems ENDS products to other compliant businesses. With this approval, over 97 of our total annual sales became eligible for
shipment by freight, USPS and other major parcel carriers. The PACT Act Exemption also enables us to partner with other businesses that
ship ENDS products and had their supply chains disrupted by PACT Act compliance. 

On
June 24, 2022, we provided via press release an update on the progress of the PACT Act Exemption, following our successful implementation
of the controls, processes and systems required by the USPS in connection with the shipment of ENDS products. We expect the ability to
fulfill ENDS orders with the USPS to allow us to reduce shipping costs, decrease fulfillment times and enhance the overall customer experience
for approved wholesale customers. 

Reverse
Stock Split 

On
June 2, 2023, we filed a Certificate of Amendment to the A R Charter with the SSSD, which effected a one-for-10 reverse stock split
(the 2023 Reverse Stock Split and together with the 2022 Reverse Stock Split, the Reverse Stock Splits of
our issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock at 5:01 PM Eastern Time on June 5, 2023. As a result of the 2023 Reverse Stock Split,
every 10 shares of common stock issued and outstanding were converted into one share of common stock. We paid cash in lieu of fractional
shares, and accordingly, no fractional shares were issued in connection with the 2023 Reverse Stock Split. 

The
Reverse Stock Split did not change the par value of the Common Stock or the authorized number of shares of Common Stock. All outstanding
options, restricted stock awards, warrants and other securities entitling their holders to purchase or otherwise receive shares of our
Common Stock have been adjusted as a result of the Reverse Stock Split, as required by the terms of each security. The number of shares
available to be awarded under our Second Amended and Restated 2019 Equity Incentive Plan have also been appropriately adjusted. See Note
10 Compensation Plans for more information. 

On
July 23, 2024, the Board approved the reverse split at a ratio of one-for-11 and the Amendment has been filed with the Secretary of State
of the State of Delaware, which became effective on August 5, 2024 at 12:01 AM Eastern Time, before the opening of trading on the Nasdaq. 

All
share and per share amounts were retroactively adjusted for all periods presented to give effect to the Reverse Stock Split. 

Critical
Accounting Estimates 

We
prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America U.S. GAAP ). The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements,
and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing
basis. We base our estimates on historical experience, outside advice from parties believed to be experts in such matters, and on various
other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments
about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Judgments and uncertainties affecting
the application of those policies may result in materially different amounts being reported under different conditions or using different
assumptions. See Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for a description the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation
of our consolidated financial statements. 

Inventories 

Inventories,
consisting of finished products, are primarily accounted for using the weighted-average method, and are valued at the lower of cost and
net realizable value. This valuation requires us to make judgments, based on currently available information, about the likely method
of disposition, such as through sales to customers or liquidations. Assumptions about the future disposition of inventory are inherently
uncertain and changes in our estimates and assumptions may cause us to realize material write-downs in the future. 

29 

Income
Taxes and TRA Liability 

We
are a corporation subject to income taxes in the United States. Certain subsidiaries of the Operating Company are taxable separately
from us. Our proportional share of the Operating Company s subsidiaries provisions are included in our consolidated financial
statements. 

As
of December 31, 2022, we held all the outstanding Common Units in the Operating Company and are the sole member. As a result, in 2023,
100 of the Operating Company s US and state income and expenses are now included in our US and state tax returns. 

Our
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are computed for differences between the tax basis and financial statement amounts that will
result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future. We compute deferred balances based on enacted tax laws and applicable rates for
the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. A valuation allowance is recognized for deferred tax assets
if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the net deferred tax assets will not be realized. In making such a determination,
we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected
future taxable income, tax-planning strategies, and results of recent operations. If we determine we would be able to realize our deferred
tax assets for which a valuation allowance had been recorded, then we would adjust the deferred tax asset valuation allowance, which
would reduce our provision for income taxes. 

We
evaluate the tax positions taken on income tax returns that remain open and positions expected to be taken on the current year tax returns
to identify uncertain tax positions. Unrecognized tax benefits on uncertain tax positions are recorded on the basis of a two-step process
in which (1) we determine whether it is more likely than not that the tax positions will be sustained on the basis of the technical merits
of the position and (2) for those tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, the largest amount of tax benefit
that is more than 50 percent likely to be realized is recognized. Interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are recorded
in income tax benefit. We have no uncertain tax positions that qualify for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements. 

In
addition to tax expenses, we may incur expenses related to our operations and may be required to make payments under the Tax Receivable
Agreement (the TRA ), which could be significant. Pursuant to the Greenlane Operating Agreement, Greenlane Holdings, LLC
will generally make pro rata tax distributions to its members in an amount sufficient to fund all or part of their tax obligations with
respect to the taxable income of Greenlane Holdings, LLC that is allocated to them and possibly in excess of such amount.

Consolidated
Results of Operations 

Net
Sales 

For
the three months ended September 30, 2024, net sales were approximately
 4.0 million, compared to approximately 11.8 million for the same period in 2024, representing a decrease of 7.8 million, or 65.8 .
The year-over-year decrease in net sales was due to a major restructuring of our Industrial Group in April of 2023, involving our packaging
and industrial vaping product lines; transitioning much of this business from a gross sales to a commission structure to preserve working
capital. Revenues decreased in the Consumer Brands Group due, in part, to restructuring efforts and shift in strategy to focus on in-house
brands that carry a higher margin profile while rationalizing third-party brand offerings, which generated top line revenue with lower
margins. The consumer products were affected by the inability to access capital markets on equitable terms, resulting in stock-outs and
shortages of higher velocity inventory. The Company is continuing to focus on profitable revenue and as a result top line revenue has
significantly been reduced. Concurrently, the Company has continued its focus on right-sizing the business during the fiscal year ended
December 31, 2023 and through present, in an effort to reduce sales and marketing costs and reduce or eliminate certain administrative
functions. 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net sales were approximately 11.6 million, compared to approximately 55.4 million for the
same period in 2024, representing a decrease of 43.8 million, or 79.0 . The year-over-year decrease in net sales was due to a major

Cost
of Sales and Gross Margin 

For
the three months ended September 30, 2024, cost of sales decreased by 7.7
million, or 88.3 , as compared to the same period in 2023. The decrease in the cost of sales is driven by the 65.8 decrease in revenue
in addition to a decrease in damaged and obsolete inventory write-offs. 

For the nine months ended September
30, 2024, cost of sales decreased by 36.1 million, or 85.6 , as compared to the same period in 2023. The decrease in the cost of sales
is driven by the 79.0 decrease in revenue in addition to a decrease in damaged and obsolete inventory write-offs. 

Gross
margin percentage increased 48.4 to 75.0 for the three months ended September
30, 2024, compared to 26.5 for the same period in 2023. 

Gross
margin percentage increased 23.9 to 47.8 for the nine months ended September
30, 2024, compared to 23.9 for the same period in 2023. 

Salaries,
Benefits and Payroll Taxes 

Salaries,
benefits and payroll taxes expenses decreased by approximately 2.5 million,
or 60.4 , to 1.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 4.1 million for the same period in 2023. The decrease
is related to the reduction in workforce to right-size the business and focus on profitability. 

Salaries,
benefits and payroll taxes expenses decreased by approximately 8.5 million,
or 58.4 , to 6.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 14.6 million for the same period in 2023. The decrease
is related to the reduction in workforce to right-size the business and focus on profitability. 

As
we continue to closely monitor the evolving business landscape, we remain focused on identifying cost-saving opportunities while delivering
on our strategy to recruit, train, promote and retain the most talented and success-driven personnel in the industry.

General
and Administrative Expenses 

General
and administrative expenses decreased by approximately 3.7 million, or 67.4 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to
the same period in 2023. The decrease is related to major restructuring effort by the Company to reduce cost and right-size the business.
Compared with the first quarter of 2023, the Company focused on reduction across the board in general and administrative expenses and
saw large decreases in professional and outside services, facility expenses, outbound freight, other general and administrative, marketing,
taxes and licenses, and general insurance. 

General
and administrative expenses decreased by approximately 13.3 million, or 66.0 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the

Change
in fair value of contingent consideration 

There
was a change in fair value of contingent consideration of approximately
 1.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. The change is primarily related to known
reductions in earnouts related to Davinci and Eyce products. 

32 

Gain
on debt extinguishment 

There
was an increase in gain on debt extinguishment of approximately 2.2 million
for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023. The change is primarily related to a difference in
the reduction in overall debt modification with Synergy, offset by the carrying value of the Davinci and Eyce assets acquired by Synergy.
For further information, see Note 6, Debt of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1
of this Form 10-Q. 

Provision
for (Benefit from) Income Taxes 

For
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, the effective tax rate differed from the U.S. federal statutory
tax rate of 21 primarily due to the Operating Company s pass-through structure for U.S. income tax purposes (through December
31, 2022), the relative mix in earnings and losses in the U.S. versus foreign tax jurisdictions, and the valuation allowance against
the deferred tax asset. 

Liquidity,
Capital Resources and Going Concern 

Our
primary requirements for liquidity and capital are working capital, debt service related to recent acquisitions and general corporate
needs. Our primary sources of liquidity are our cash on hand and the cash flow that we generate from our operations, as well as proceeds
other equity issuances. As of September 30, 2024, we had approximately 2.3 million of cash, of which none was restricted and 0.1 million
was held in foreign bank accounts, and approximately 2.5 million of negative working capital, which is calculated as total current assets
minus total current liabilities, as compared to approximately 0.5 million of cash, of which 0.1 million was held in foreign bank accounts,
and approximately 3.7 million of working capital as of December 31, 2023. The repatriation of cash balances from our foreign subsidiaries
could have adverse tax impacts or be subject to capital controls; however, these balances are generally available to fund the ordinary
business operations of our foreign subsidiaries without legal or other restrictions. 

We
believe that our cash on hand and the cash flow that we generate from our operations will not be sufficient to fund our working capital
and capital expenditure requirements, as well as our debt repayments and other liquidity requirements associated with our existing operations,
for the next 12 months. Based on our cash on hand and working capital at September 30, 2024, we may have insufficient cash to fund planned
operations into the fourth quarter of 2024. This is evident from our continued efforts to raise capital and leverage external funding
to fulfil our capital needs as highlighted below. 

33 

ATM
Program and Shelf Registration Statement 

We
formerly used a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (the Shelf Registration Statement to conduct securities offerings.
In August 2021, we filed a prospectus supplement and established an at-the-market equity offering program (the ATM
Program that provided for the sale of shares of our Class A common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to 50 million,
from time to time. 

Since
the launch of the ATM program in August 2021 and through December 31, 2022, we sold shares of our Class A common stock which generated
gross proceeds of approximately 12.7 million and we paid fees to the sales agent of approximately 0.4 million. Due to the untimely
filing of certain of our Quarterly and Annual Reports, we are unable to issue additional shares of Class A common stock pursuant to the
ATM Program or otherwise use the Shelf Registration Statement. 

Common
Stock and Warrant Offerings 

On
June 29, 2023, we entered into securities purchase agreements with certain investors, pursuant to which we agreed to issue and sell an
aggregate of 50,952 shares of our Class A common stock, pre-funded warrants to purchase up to 317,013 shares of our Class A Common Stock
(the July 2023 Pre-Funded Warrants and warrants to purchase up to 735,931 shares of our Class A common stock (the July
2023 Standard Warrants ). The July 2023 units were offered pursuant to a Registration Statement on Form S-1 (the July 2023
Offering ). The July 2023 Offering generated gross proceeds of approximately 4.3 million and net proceeds to the Company of approximately
 3.8 million and closed on July 3, 2023. 

On
August 12, 2024, the Company entered into a securities purchase agreement with a single institutional investor for aggregate gross cash
proceeds of 6.5 million. In connection with the private placement, the Company will issue an aggregate of 2,363,637 units and pre-funded
units. The pre-funded units will be sold at the same purchase price as the units, less the pre-funded warrant exercise price of 0.00001.
Each unit and pre-funded unit will consist of one share of common stock (or one pre-funded warrant) and two common warrants, each exercisable
for one share of common stock at an exercise price of 2.50 per share. The common warrant will be exercisable on the initial exercise
date described in the common warrant and will expire 5.0 years from such date. 

Asset-Based
Loan 

On
August 9, 2022, we entered into an asset-based loan agreement dated as of August 8, 2022 (the Loan Agreement ), which made
available to the Company a term loan of up to 15.0 million. On February 9, 2023, we entered into Amendment No. 2 to the Loan Agreement,
in which we agreed to, among other things, voluntarily prepay approximately 6.6 million (inclusive of early termination fees and expenses)
under the terms provided for under the Loan Agreement and the lenders under the Loan Agreement agreed to release 5.7 million in funds
held in a blocked account pursuant to the terms of the Loan Agreement. 

On
August 7, 2023, we repaid the approximately 4.3 million in aggregate principal amount (the Loan Repayment which remained
outstanding under the terms of the Loan Agreement. As a result of the Loan Repayment, the Company has been released from its obligations
under the Loan Agreement, in accordance with the terms of the Loan Agreement. See Note 6 - Long Term Debt for more information. 

ERC
Sale 

On
February 16, 2023, two of our wholly owned subsidiaries, Warehouse Goods LLC and KIM International LLC, entered into an agreement with
a third-party institutional investor pursuant to which the investor purchased, for approximately 4.9 million in cash, an economic participation
interest, at a discount, in our rights to payment from the United States Internal Revenue Service for certain periods with respect to
the employee retention credits filed by us under the Employee Retention Credit program. 

Future
Receivables Financings 

In
July, August, October, and November 2023, the Company received an aggregate of approximately 3.9 million in cash pursuant to the terms
of future receivables financings (collectively, the Future Receivables Financings entered into with two private lenders.
See Note 6 - Long Term Debt for more information. 

Notes
Payable 

On
June 7, 2024, the Company entered into a subscription agreement with Cobra Alternative Capital Strategies, LLC. As of September 30, 2024,
the Company has been loaned 3.1 million with net cash proceeds of 2.6 million with a remaining balance of 1.0 million. The note was issued with a 20 original issue discount and is
due in full on December 7, 2024. See Note 6 - Long Term Debt for more information.

Management
Initiatives 

We
have completed several initiatives to optimize our working capital requirements. We launched Groove, a new, innovative Greenlane Brands
product line, and we also rationalized our third-party brands product offering, which enables us to reduce inventory carrying costs and
working capital requirements. 

In
April 2023, we entered into two strategic partnerships. First, we entered into a strategic partnership (the MJ Packaging
Partnership with A A Global Imports d/b/a MarijuanaPackaging.com MJ Pack ), a provider of packaging
solutions to the cannabis industry. On August 8, 2024 the Company terminated its strategic partnership with MJ Packaging and is
resuming its business as a direct provider of packaging solutions to the cannabis industry. MJ Packaging however, remains a
distribution customer of the Company. Second, we entered into a strategic partnership with an affiliate of one of our existing vape
suppliers Vape Partner to service certain key customers with vaporizer goods and services (the Vape
Partnership ). As part of the Vape Partnership, we will introduce our Vape Partner to certain key customers, assist with the
promotion and the sale of certain vaporizer goods and services, and help coordinate the logistics, storage and distribution of such
vaporizer products. If our Vape Partner and key customer(s) enter into a direct relationship, the customers would directly purchase
vaporizer goods and services, which we currently sell them, directly from our Vape Partner and we would no longer need to purchase
such vape inventory on behalf of such key customer(s). In exchange we would earn quarterly and annual commission payments from our
strategic partners. While the strategic partnership may result in a decrease in top line revenue for these vape
products, this partnership combined with some of our other restructuring initiatives should allow us to reduce our overall
cost-structure and enhance our margins, thereby improving our balance sheet. 

We
have successfully renegotiated supplier partnership terms and are continuing to improve working capital arrangements with suppliers.
We have made progress consolidating and streamlining our office, warehouse, and distribution operations footprint. We have reduced our
workforce by approximately 49 throughout fiscal year 2023 to reduce costs and align with our revenue projections. 

We
have incurred net losses of 8.9 million and 27.8 million for the nine
months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, cash used in operating activities
was 5.2 million and cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2023 was 1.8 million. The recent macroeconomic
environment has caused weaker demand than contemplated under our business plan, resulting in a reduction in projected revenue and cash
flows for the twelve-month period included in the going concern evaluation. 

As
a result of our losses and our projected cash needs, combined with our current liquidity level, substantial doubt exists about the Company s
ability to continue as a going concern. The Company s ability to continue as a going concern is contingent upon successful execution
of management s intended plan over the next twelve months to improve the Company s liquidity and profitability, which includes,
without limitation: 

Further
 reducing operating costs expense by taking additional restructuring actions to align cost with revenue to achieve profitability. 

Increasing
 revenue by introducing new products and acquiring new customers. 

Execute
 on strategic partnerships accretive to margins and operating cash 

Seeking
 additional capital through the issuance of debt or equity securities. 

Our
opinions concerning liquidity are based on currently available information. To the extent this information proves to be inaccurate, or
if circumstances change, future availability of trade credit or other sources of financing may be reduced and our liquidity could be
adversely affected. Our future capital requirements and the adequacy of available funds will depend on many factors, including those
described in the section titled Risk Factors in Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,
2023. Depending on the severity and direct impact of these factors on us, we may be unable to secure additional financing to meet our
operating requirements on terms favorable to us, or at all. 

As
of September 30, 2024, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to have a material current or future
effect on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources.

Cybersecurity 

Risk
Management and Strategy 

We
recognize the critical importance of developing, implementing, and maintaining robust cybersecurity measures to safeguard our information
systems and protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of our data. 

Managing
Material Risks Integrated Overall Risk Management 

We
have strategically integrated cybersecurity risk management into our broader risk management framework to promote a company-wide culture
of cybersecurity risk management. This integration ensures that cybersecurity considerations are an integral part of our decision-making
processes at every level. Our management team continuously evaluates and addresses cybersecurity risks in alignment with our business
objectives and operational needs. 

Oversee
Third-party Risk 

Because
we are aware of the risks associated with third-party service providers, we have implemented stringent processes to oversee and manage
these risks. We conduct thorough security assessments of all third-party providers before engagement and maintain ongoing monitoring
to ensure compliance with our cybersecurity standards. The monitoring includes annual assessments of the SOC reports of our providers
and implementing complementary controls. This approach is designed to mitigate risks related to data breaches or other security incidents
originating from third-parties. 

Risks
from Cybersecurity Threats 

We
have not encountered cybersecurity challenges that have materially impaired our operations or financial standing.

ITEM
4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Management s
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

We
have established disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
as amended (the Exchange Act ), that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports
that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the
SEC s rules and forms, and is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial
Officer, as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and
procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable
assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit
relationship of possible controls and procedures. Accordingly, even effective disclosure controls and procedures can only provide reasonable
assurance of achieving their control objectives. 

Under
the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, we evaluated
the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. Based upon their evaluation, our Chief Executive
Officer and our Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective
because of the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting described in Item 9A of Part II of our Annual Report
on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, which have not yet been remediated as of September 30, 2024. 

Material
Weaknesses Remediation Plan and Status 

As
previously described in Item 9A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, we began implementing a remediation
plan to address the material weaknesses identified in the prior year, and our management continues to be actively engaged in the remediation
efforts. 

As
previously disclosed, in 2020, we began a multi-year implementation of a new ERP system, which will replace our existing core financial
systems, and which was completed in 2023. Management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of
possible controls and procedures, based upon which, management focused its allocation of organizational resources to ensure the successful
implementation of the new ERP system during 2023, and is continuing to add additional processes for the design and implementation of
effective control activities. Conversely, management noted limited efforts related to re-designing user access roles and permissions
in the legacy ERP system. Based on these considerations, and subject to management s ongoing assessment, we do not expect that
the previously reported material weaknesses related to ineffective user access controls will be considered remediated until our new ERP
system has been fully utilize to its potential and we have properly set controls in place. Additionally, to remediate the identified
material weaknesses, we are continuing to take the following remediation actions: 

implement
 enhancements to company-wide risk assessment processes and to process and control documentation; 

enhance
 the Company s review and sign-off procedures for IT implementations; 

implement
 additional review procedures designed to enhance the control owner s execution of control activities, including entity level
 controls, through the implementation of improved documentation standards evidencing execution of these controls, oversight, and training; 

improve
 control activities and procedures associated with certain accounting areas, including proper segregation of duties and assigning
 personnel with the appropriate experience as preparers and reviewers over analyses relating to such accounting areas; 

educate
 and train control owners regarding internal control processes to mitigate identified risks and maintain adequate documentation to
 evidence the effective design and operation of such processes; 

and
 implement enhanced controls to monitor the effectiveness of the underlying business process controls that are dependent on the data
 and financial reports generated from the relevant information systems. 

37 

We
are also continuing to evaluate additional controls and procedures that may be required to remediate the identified material weaknesses.
We cannot provide assurances that the previously reported material weaknesses will be considered remediated until the applicable controls
operate for a sufficient period of time and management has concluded, through testing, that these controls are operating effectively. 

Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

As
discussed above, in 2020 we began a multi-year implementation of a new ERP system which fully replaced our legacy financial systems in
2023. The ERP system is designed to accurately maintain the Company s financial records, enhance the flow of financial information,
improve data management and provide timely information to our management team. Subsequent to implementation of the new ERP system, we
are continuing to change certain processes and procedures which, in turn, are expected to result in changes to our internal control over
financial reporting. As such changes occur, we will evaluate quarterly whether such changes materially affect our internal control over
financial reporting. 

There
were no other changes to our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that
have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

PART
II. OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM
1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 

For
a description of our material pending legal proceedings, see Note 7 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included
in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 

ITEM
1A. RISK FACTORS 

There
have been no material changes from the risk factors disclosed in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December
31, 2023, filed with the SEC on July 19, 2024, except as set forth below. 

There
is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern through the next 12 months from the date of the condensed consolidated
financial statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 

The
Company has incurred net losses of 8.9 million and 27.8 million for
the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and the prior year comparable period, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024,
cash used in operating activities was 5.2 million, and cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2023 was 1.8
million. Based on our cash on hand and working capital at September 30, 2024, we may have insufficient cash to fund planned operations
into the fourth quarter of 2024. As a result of our losses and our projected cash needs, combined with our current liquidity level, substantial
doubt exists about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern over the next 12 months. The recent macroeconomic environment
has caused weaker demand than contemplated under the Company s business plan, resulting in a reduction in projected revenue and
cash flows for the twelve-month period included in the going concern evaluation. 

Our
ability to continue as a going concern is contingent upon successful execution of management s intended plan over the next twelve
months to improve the our liquidity and profitability, which includes, without limitation: 

Further
 reducing operating costs expense by taking additional restructuring actions to align cost with revenue 

Increasing
 revenue by introducing new products and acquiring new customers. 

Execute
 on strategic partnerships accretive to margins and operating cash 

Seeking
 additional capital through the issuance of equity securities or obtaining debt financing. 

There
can be no assurance that any such measures will be successful. If we are not successful in improving our liquidity position and the profitability
of our operations, we may need to consider all strategic alternatives, including seeking additional debt or equity capital, reducing
or delaying our business activities and strategic initiatives, or selling assets, other strategic transactions and/or other measures,
including receivership or, to the extent available, bankruptcy protection. In addition, the perception that we may not be able to continue
as a going concern may cause vendors and customers to choose not to do business with us due to concerns about our ability to meet our
contractual obligations. If we seek additional financing to fund our operations and there remains substantial doubt about our ability
to continue as a going concern, our financing sources may be unwilling to provide additional funding to us on commercially reasonable
terms or at all. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that may result from the outcome of this going
concern uncertainty. Such adjustments could be material. 

38 

We
have failed, and may continue to fail, to meet the listing standards of Nasdaq, and as a result our Class A common stock may become delisted,
which could have a material adverse effect on the liquidity of our Class A common stock. 

If
we fail to continue to satisfy the continued listing requirements of Nasdaq, such as the corporate governance or public float requirements,
or the minimum closing bid price requirement, Nasdaq will take steps to de-list our Class A common stock. As a result of several factors,
including but not limited to our financial performance, market sentiment about the cannabis industry, volatility in the financial markets
generally due to the tightening of monetary policy by the Board of Governors of the United States Federal Reserve Bank (the Federal
Reserve and other geopolitical events, events such as the ongoing wars around the world, the per share price of our Class A common
stock has declined below the minimum bid price threshold required for continued listing. Such a de-listing would likely have a negative
effect on the price of our Class A common stock and would impair your ability to sell or purchase our Class A common stock when you wish
to do so, as well as adversely affect our ability to issue additional securities and obtain additional financing in the future. 

On
August 21, 2023, we received a letter from the staff of Nasdaq indicating that we were not in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5450(a)(1)
because the closing bid price per share for our Class A common stock had closed below 1.00 for the previous 30 consecutive business
days (the Minimum Bid Price Requirement ). We were given 180 days, or until February 20, 2024 to regain compliance with
the Minimum Bid Price Requirement. We also filed an application to transfer the listing of our Class A common stock from the Nasdaq Global
Market to the Nasdaq Capital Market, which transfer was approved and occurred on February 9, 2024. As a result of the transfer, we became
eligible to request an additional an additional 180-day compliance period. 

On
February 21, 2024, Nasdaq notified us in writing that while we had not regained compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement, we
were eligible for an additional 180-day compliance period, or until August 19, 2024, to regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price
Requirement. Nasdaq s determination was based on us having met the continued listing requirement for market value of publicly held
shares and all other applicable requirements for initial listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market, with the exception of the Minimum Bid
Price Requirement, and on our written notice to Nasdaq of our intention to cure the deficiency during the second compliance period by
effecting a reverse stock split, if necessary. 

If
we do not regain compliance during the second 180-day period, then Nasdaq will notify us of its determination to delist our Class A common
stock, at which point we would have an opportunity to appeal the delisting determination to a hearings panel. We would remain listed
on Nasdaq pending the hearings panel s decision. There can be no assurance that, if we do appeal the delisting determination by
Nasdaq to the hearings panel, that such appeal would be successful. 

On
January 24, 2024, Gina Collins gave notice of her resignation from our Board of Directors and from each committee of the Board, effective
immediately. Ms. Collins was an independent director, and as a result of her resignation, we no longer comply with the majority independent
board requirement of Nasdaq as set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5605(b)(1) because independent directors do not comprise a majority of
the Board of Directors, and Nasdaq s audit committee requirements as set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5605(c)(2)(A) because the
Audit Committee of the Board of Directors is not comprised of at least three independent directors. 

On
January 29, 2024, in accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rules, we notified Nasdaq of Ms. Collins resignation and the resulting non-compliance.
On January 30, 2024, we received a notice from Nasdaq acknowledging the fact that we do not meet the requirements of such rules. In accordance
with Nasdaq Listing Rules 5605(b)(1)(A) and 5605(c)(4), to regain compliance with the Nasdaq Listing Rules, we have until the earlier
of our next annual stockholders meeting or January 24, 2025. 

On
April 18, 2024, we received a notice from Nasdaq stating that because we had not yet filed our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal
year ended December 31, 2023, we were no longer in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5250(c)(1). Nasdaq Listing Rule 5250(c)(1) requires
listed companies to timely file all required periodic financial reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 

On
May 21, 2024, we received a notice from Nasdaq stating that because we had not yet filed our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal
quarter ended March 31, 2024, we were no longer in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5250(c)(1). 

The
Company had 60 calendar days from April 18, 2024, or until June 17, 2024, to regain compliance by filing the Form 10-K and the Form 10-Q
or to submit to Nasdaq a plan to regain compliance with the Nasdaq Listing Rules. We timely submitted the plan to regain compliance to
Nasdaq and Nasdaq granted us additional time to file the Form 10K and 10Q. As of the date of this filing we have filed both the 10K and
10Q within the additional time period granted.
