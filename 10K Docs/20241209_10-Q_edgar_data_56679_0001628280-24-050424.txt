performance obligation, which is the promise to undertake a search. The Company generally recognizes such revenue over the course of a search and when it is legally entitled to payment as outlined in the billing terms of the contract. Any revenues associated with services that are provided on a contingent basis are recognized once the contingency is resolved, as this is when control is transferred to the customer. These assumptions determine the timing of revenue recognition for the reported period. In addition to talent acquisition for permanent placement roles, the Professional Search Interim segment also offers recruitment services for interim roles. Interim roles are short term in duration, generally less than 12 months. Generally, each interim role is a separate performance obligation. The Company recognizes fee revenue over the duration that the interim resources services are provided which also aligns to the contracted invoicing plan and enforceable right to payment. 
 RPO fee revenue is generated through distinct phases: 1) the implementation phase and 2) the post-implementation recruitment phase. The fees associated with the implementation phase are recognized over the period that the related implementation services are provided. The post-implementation recruitment phase represents end-to-end recruiting services to clients for which there are both fixed and variable fees, which are recognized over the period that the related recruiting services are performed.

impairment charge was recognized. As of October 31, 2024 and April 30, 2024, there were indicators of potential impairment with respect to the Company s goodwill that would require further testing for impairment. 
 Intangible assets primarily consist of customer lists, non-compete agreements, proprietary databases and IP. Intangible assets are recorded at their estimated fair value at the date of acquisition and are amortized in a pattern in which the asset is consumed if that pattern can be reliably determined, or using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives, which range from one to years. For intangible assets subject to amortization, an impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of the intangible assets is not recoverable and exceeds fair value. The carrying amount of the intangible assets is considered not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from use of the asset. The Company reviewed its intangible assets and did identify any indicators of impairment as of October 31, 2024 and April 30, 2024.

 The Company s ECAP is intended to provide certain employees an opportunity to defer their salary and/or bonus on a pre-tax basis. In addition, the Company, as part of its compensation philosophy, makes discretionary contributions into the ECAP and such contributions may be granted to key employees annually based on the employee s performance. Certain key members of management may also receive Company ECAP contributions upon commencement of employment. The Company amortizes these contributions on a straight-line basis over the service period, generally a period. Participants have the ability to allocate their deferrals among a number of investment options and may receive their benefits at termination, retirement or in service either in a lump sum or in quarterly installments over one -to- years. The ECAP amounts that are expected to be paid to employees over the next 12 months are classified as a current liability included in compensation and benefits payable on the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets. 
 The ECAP is accounted for whereby the changes in the fair value of the vested amounts owed to the participants are adjusted with a corresponding charge (or credit) to compensation and benefits costs. During the three and six months ended October 31, 2024, deferred compensation liability increased; therefore, the Company recognized an increase in compensation expense of million and million, respectively. Offsetting the increases in compensation and benefits expense was an increase in the fair value of marketable securities (held in trust to satisfy obligations of the ECAP liabilities) of million and million during the three and six months ended October 31, 2024, recorded in other income (loss), net on the condensed consolidated statements of operations. During the three months ended October 31, 2023, deferred compensation liability decreased; therefore, the Company recognized a reduction in compensation expense of million. Offsetting the decrease in compensation and benefits expense was a decrease in the fair value of marketable securities (held in trust to satisfy obligations of the ECAP liabilities) of million during the three months ended October 31, 2023, recorded in other income (loss), net on the condensed consolidated statements of operations (see Note 5 Financial Instruments).

Of the million of remaining performance obligations, the Company expects to recognize approximately million in the remainder of fiscal 2025, million in fiscal 2026, million in fiscal 2027 and the remaining million in fiscal 2028 and thereafter. However, this amount should not be considered an indication of the Company s future revenue as contracts with an initial term of one year or less are not included. Further, our contract terms and conditions allow for clients to increase or decrease the scope of services and such changes do not increase or decrease a performance obligation until the Company has an enforceable right to payment.

 Executive Summary 
 Korn Ferry (referred to herein as the Company or in the first-person notations we, our and us is a leading global organizational consulting firm. We help clients synchronize strategy, operations and talent to drive superior business performance. We work with organizations to design their structures, roles and responsibilities. We help them hire the right people to bring their strategy to life. And we advise them on how to reward, develop and motivate their people. 
 We are pursuing a strategy designed to help our colleagues focus on clients, by bringing all of our resources together to solve their human capital issues. This approach is intended to build on the best of our past and give us a clear path to the future with focused initiatives to increase our client and commercial impact. Korn Ferry is transforming how clients address their talent management needs. We have evolved from a mono-line business to a multi-faceted consultancy business, giving our consultants more frequent and expanded opportunities to engage with clients. 
 23 

The Company services its clients with a core set of solutions that are anchored around talent and talent management touching nearly every aspect of an employer s engagement with their employees. Our five core solutions are as follows: Organizational Strategy, Assessment and Succession, Leadership and Professional Development, Total Rewards, and Talent Acquisition. Our colleagues engage with our clients through the delivery of one of our core solutions as a point solution sale or through combining component parts of our core solutions into an integrated solution. In either case, we are helping to solve our clients most challenging business and human capital issues. 
 Further differentiating our service offerings from our competitors is the unique combination of IP, content, and data sets that we have, which permeate throughout our solution areas. For many years, we have been accumulating data around assessments of executives and professionals, pay, success profiles, organizational engagement and design, job architecture, and candidates. Integrating this unique collection of data into our service offerings provides our colleagues with differentiated points of view and solutions, as well as the ability to demonstrate the efficacy of all of our offerings. 
 Our vision remains unchanged: to become the premier organizational consulting firm. We believe our household brand, unparalleled IP, and diversification strategy will continue to positively influence our performance and accelerate the trajectory of thousands of organizations. Indeed, Korn Ferry is uniquely positioned as a firm relentlessly focused on synchronizing strategy, operations and talent and a firm that offers increasingly relevant solutions in a rapidly changing world. The continual advancement of technologies like generative AI creates a constant demand for workers to be upskilled or reskilled. We expect these changes and disruptions will lead to opportunities for Korn Ferry and make us more relevant than at any time in our history. 
 Leveraging the strong connection between our various service offerings and our lines of business, we have an integrated go-to-market strategy. As we drive this strategy, a focal point for us is our Marquee and Regional account program which is comprised of more than 340 of our top clients. These accounts have Global Account Leaders assigned who help to orchestrate the delivery of core and integrated solutions that cut across multiple lines of business effectively making all of the Firm s resources available as our clients tackle their business and human capital issues. Despite near-term headwinds, such as economic uncertainty, we believe Korn Ferry is poised for continued growth. We are capitalizing on the current and growing relevance of our core and integrated solutions which, in combination with the strong connections amongst our service offerings and our acquisition activities, drives top-line synergies that have resulted in double digit fee revenue growth rates (CAGR) over the past twenty years. 
 Our eight reportable segments operate through the following five lines of business: 
 1. Consulting aligns organizational structure, culture, performance, development and people to drive sustainable growth by addressing four fundamental organizational and talent needs: Organizational Strategy, Assessment and Succession, Leadership and Professional Development, and Total Rewards. The Consulting teams work across our core capabilities, architecting integrated solutions and technology products to help clients execute their strategy in a digitally enabled world. 
 2. Digital develops IP and science-based talent technology products that empower our clients. Our talent products and talent platform support our clients in making critical talent decisions across the continuum from talent acquisition to talent development. 
 3. Executive Search helps organizations recruit board level, chief executive and other C-suite/senior executive and general management talent to deliver lasting impact. Our approach to placing talent brings together research-based IP, proprietary assessments, and behavioral interviewing with our practical experience to determine the ideal organizational fit. Salary benchmarking then helps us build appropriate frameworks for compensation and attraction. This business is managed and reported on a geographic basis and represents four of the Company s reportable segments (Executive Search North America, Executive Search Europe, the Middle East and Africa EMEA ), Executive Search Asia Pacific APAC ), and Executive Search Latin America). 
 4. Professional Search Interim delivers enterprise talent acquisition solutions for permanent placements at the professional level for middle and upper management, and, for interim, at those same levels plus senior executives. We help clients source high-quality candidates at speed and scale globally, covering single-hire to multi-hire permanent placements and interim contractors (that are focused on senior executive, information technology ("IT"), Finance Accounting and human resources roles). 
 5. Recruitment Process Outsourcing RPO offers scalable recruitment outsourcing and project solutions leveraging a customized technology enabled service delivery platform and talent insights. Our scalable solutions, built on our IP, science, and data and powered by best-in-class technology and consulting expertise, enable us to act as a strategic partner in clients quest for superior recruitment outcomes and better candidate fit.

Q2 FY'25 Performance Highlights 
 
 Fee revenue in Q2 FY'25 was 674.4 million, a year-over-year decrease of 4 . 
 
 Operating income was 87.5 million and Adjusted EBITDA was 117.0 million. 
 
 Operating margin increased 980bps year-over-year to 13.0 . Adjusted EBITDA margin was 17.4 , a 340bps increase compared to the year-ago quarter. 
 
 Net income attributable to Korn Ferry was 60.8 million, while diluted earnings per share was 1.14 in Q2 FY'25. 
 
 The Company evaluates performance and allocates resources based on the chief operating decision maker s review of (1) fee revenue and (2) adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization Adjusted EBITDA ). To the extent that such charges occur, Adjusted EBITDA excludes restructuring charges, integration/acquisition costs, certain separation costs and certain non-cash charges (goodwill, intangible asset and other impairments charges). For the three months ended October 31, 2024, Adjusted EBITDA excluded 0.6 million of restructuring charges, net, and 3.9 million of integration/acquisition costs. For the six months ended October 31, 2024, Adjusted EBITDA excluded 0.6 million of restructuring charges, net, and 5.0 million of integration/acquisition costs. For the three months ended October 31, 2023, Adjusted EBITDA excluded 63.5 million of restructuring charges, net, 5.0 million of integration/acquisition costs, and 1.5 million impairment of fixed assets. For the six months ended October 31, 2023, Adjusted EBITDA excluded 63.9 million of restructuring charges, net, 9.2 million of integration/acquisition costs, 1.6 million of impairment of right-of-use assets, and 1.6 million impairment of fixed assets. 
 Consolidated and the subtotals of Executive Search Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are non-GAAP financial measures and have limitations as analytical tools. They should not be viewed as a substitute for financial information determined in accordance with United States U.S. generally accepted accounting principles GAAP and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the Company s results as reported under GAAP. In addition, they may not necessarily be comparable to non-GAAP performance measures that may be presented by other companies. 
 Management believes the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures provides meaningful supplemental information regarding Korn Ferry s performance by excluding certain charges, items of income and other items that may not be indicative of Korn Ferry s ongoing operating results. The use of these non-GAAP financial measures facilitates comparisons to Korn Ferry s historical performance and the identification of operating trends that may otherwise be distorted by the factors discussed above. Korn Ferry includes these non-GAAP financial measures because management believes it is useful to investors in allowing for greater transparency with respect to supplemental information used by management in its evaluation of Korn Ferry s ongoing operations and financial and operational decision-making. The accounting policies for the reportable segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements, except that the above noted items are excluded to arrive at Adjusted EBITDA. Management further believes that Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors because it is frequently used by investors and other interested parties to measure operating performance among companies with different capital structures, effective tax rates and tax attributes and capitalized asset values, all of which can vary substantially from company to company.

 Other Income (Loss), Net 
 Other income, net was 19.9 million in the six months ended October 31, 2024 compared to other loss, net of 0.3 million in the year-ago period. The difference was primarily due to gains from the increase in the fair value of our marketable securities that are held in trust for the settlement of the Company's obligation under the ECAP during the six months ended October 31, 2024 compared to losses in the year-ago period. 
 Interest Expense, Net 
 Interest expense, net primarily relates to the Notes issued in December 2019, borrowings under COLI policies and interest cost related to our deferred compensation plans, which are partially offset by interest earned on cash and cash equivalent balances. Interest expense, net was 9.6 million in the six months ended October 31, 2024 compared to 11.3 million in the year-ago period. Interest expense, net decreased due to an increase in interest income earned on cash and cash equivalent balances as a result of higher average cash and cash equivalent balances in the six months ended October 31, 2024 compared to the year-ago period. 
 36 

Income Tax Provision 
 The provision for income tax was 47.3 million in the six months ended October 31, 2024, with an effective tax rate of 27.2 , compared to 20.8 million in the six months ended October 31, 2023, with an effective rate of 30.5 . In addition to the impact of U.S. state income taxes and the jurisdictional mix of earnings, which generally create variability in our effective tax rate over time, the effective tax rate for the six months ended October 31, 2023 was elevated due to lower earnings resulting from restructuring charges recorded in the six months ended October 31, 2023. 
 Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interest 
 Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest represents the portion of a subsidiary s net earnings that are attributable to shares of such subsidiary not held by Korn Ferry that are included in the condensed consolidated results of operations.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 The Company and its Board of Directors endorse a balanced approach to capital allocation. The Company s long-term priority is to invest in growth initiatives, such as the hiring of consultants, the continued development of IP and derivative products and services and the investment in synergistic, accretive merger and acquisition transactions that are expected to earn a return that is superior to the Company's cost of capital. Next, the Company s capital allocation approach contemplates the return of a portion of excess capital to stockholders, in the form of a regular quarterly dividend, subject to the factors discussed below and in the Risk Factors section of the Form 10-K. Additionally, the Company considers share repurchases on an opportunistic basis and subject to the terms of our Amended Credit Agreement (defined below) and Notes, as well as using excess cash to repay the Notes. 
 On November 1, 2024, we completed the acquisition of Trilogy, a provider of technology/digital interim talent across Europe and in the United States, for approximately 48 million, net of cash acquired. Trilogy will be part of our Interim business, which is a part of our Professional Search Interim segment. 
 On December 16, 2019, we completed a private placement of the Notes with a 400.0 million principal amount pursuant to Rule 144A and Regulation S under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The Notes were issued with a 4.5 million discount and will mature December 15, 2027, with interest payable semi-annually in arrears on June 15 and December 15 of each year, that commenced on June 15, 2020. The Notes represent senior unsecured obligations that rank equally in right of payment to all existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness. We may redeem the Notes prior to maturity, subject to certain limitations and premiums defined in the indenture governing the Notes. The Notes are guaranteed by each of our existing and future wholly owned domestic subsidiaries to the extent such subsidiaries guarantee our obligations under the Credit Agreement (defined below). The indenture governing the Notes requires that, upon the occurrence of both a Change of Control and a Rating Decline (each as defined in the indenture), we shall make an offer to purchase all of the Notes at 101 of their principal amount, and accrued and unpaid interest. We used the proceeds from the offering of the Notes to repay 276.9 million outstanding under our prior revolving credit facility and to pay expenses and fees in connection therewith. As of October 31, 2024, the fair value of the Notes was 390.0 million, which is based on borrowing rates currently required of notes with similar terms, maturity and credit risk. 
 On June 24, 2022, we entered into an amendment (the "Amendment") to our December 16, 2019 Credit Agreement (the "Credit Agreement"; as amended by the Amendment, the Amended Credit Agreement with the lenders party thereto and Bank of America, National Association as administrative agent, to, among other things (i) extend the existing maturity date of the revolving facility to June 24, 2027, (ii) replace the London interbank offered rate with Term Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("SOFR") , and (iii) replace the existing financial covenants with financial covenants described below. The Amended Credit Agreement provides for five-year senior secured credit facilities comprised of a 650.0 million revolving credit facility (the Revolver ). The Amended Credit Agreement also provides that, under certain circumstances, the Company may incur term loans or increase the aggregate principal amount of revolving commitments by an aggregate amount of up to 250 million plus an unlimited amount subject to a consolidated secured net leverage ratio of 3.25 to 1.00. See Note 11 Long-Term Debt for a further description of the Amended Credit Agreement. T he Company has a total of 645.4 million and 645.5 million available under the Revolver after 4.6 million and 4.5 million of standby letters of credit have been issued as of October 31, 2024 and April 30, 2024, respectively . The Company had a total of 12.8 million and 13.2 million of standby letters with other financial institutions as of October 31, 2024 and April 30, 2024, respectively . The standby letters of credit were generally issued in connection with the entry into certain office premise leases. 
 37 

On December 8, 2014, the Board of Directors adopted a dividend policy to distribute to our stockholders a regular quarterly cash dividend of 0.10 per share. Every quarter since the adoption of the dividend policy, the Company has declared a quarterly dividend. On June 21, 2021 and 2022, the Board of Directors increased the quarterly dividend to 0.12 per share and 0.15 per share, respectively. On June 26, 2023, the Board of Directors approved an increase of 20 in the quarterly dividend, which increased the quarterly dividend to 0.18 per share. On December 5, 2023, the Board of Directors approved an increase of 83 in the quarterly dividend, which increased the quarterly dividend to 0.33 per share. On June 12, 2024, the Board of Directors approved an increase in the quarterly dividend to 0.37 per share. The Amended Credit Agreement permits us to pay dividends to our stockholders and make share repurchases so long as there is no default under the Amended Credit Agreement, our total funded debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio (as set forth in the Amended Credit Agreement, the consolidated net leverage ratio is no greater than 5.00 to 1.00, and we are in pro forma compliance with our financial covenant. Furthermore, our Notes allow us to pay 25.0 million of dividends per fiscal year with no restrictions plus an unlimited amount of dividends so long as our consolidated total leverage ratio is not greater than 3.50 to 1.00, and there is no default under the indenture governing the Notes. The declaration and payment of future dividends under the quarterly dividend program will be at the discretion of the Board of Directors and will depend upon many factors, including our earnings, capital requirements, financial conditions, the terms of our indebtedness and other factors our Board of Directors may deem to be relevant. Our Board of Directors may, however, amend, revoke or suspend our dividend policy at any time and for any reason. 
 On June 21, 2022, our Board of Directors approved an increase to the share repurchase program of approximately 300 million, which at the time brought our available capacity to repurchase shares in the open market or privately negotiated transactions to 318.0 million. The Company repurchased approximately 56.1 million and 8.6 million of the Company s stock during the six months ended October 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. As of October 31, 2024, 126.7 million remained available for common stock repurchases under our share repurchase program. Any decision to continue to execute our currently outstanding share repurchase program will depend on our earnings, capital requirements, financial condition and other factors considered relevant by our Board of Directors. 
 Our primary source of liquidity is the fee revenue generated from our operations, supplemented by our borrowing capacity under our Amended Credit Agreement. Our performance is subject to the general level of economic activity in the geographic regions and the industries we service. We believe, based on current economic conditions, that our cash on hand and funds from operations and the Amended Credit Agreement will be sufficient to meet anticipated working capital, capital expenditures, general corporate requirements, debt repayments, share repurchases and dividend payments under our dividend policy during the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future. However, if the national or global economy, credit market conditions and/or labor markets were to deteriorate in the future, including as a result of ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty due to inflation and a potential recession, such changes have and could put further negative pressure on demand for our services and affect our operating cash flows. If these conditions were to persist over an extended period of time, we may incur negative cash flows and it might require us to access additional borrowings under the Amended Credit Agreement to meet our capital needs and/or discontinue our share repurchases and dividend policy. 
 Cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities were 967.5 million and 1,195.4 million as of October 31, 2024 and April 30, 2024, respectively. Net of amounts held in trust for deferred compensation plans and accrued bonuses, cash and marketable securities were 536.8 million and 606.4 million at October 31, 2024 and April 30, 2024, respectively. As of October 31, 2024 and April 30, 2024, we held 364.5 million and 393.8 million, respectively, of cash and cash equivalents in foreign locations, net of amounts held in trust for deferred compensation plans and to pay accrued bonuses. Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and highly liquid investments purchased with original maturities of three months or less. Marketable securities consist of mutual funds and investments in commercial paper, corporate notes/bonds and U.S. Treasury and Agency securities. The primary objectives of our investment in mutual funds are to meet the obligations under certain of our deferred compensation plans, while the commercial paper, corporate notes/bonds and U.S. Treasury and Agency securities are available for general corporate purposes. 
 As of October 31, 2024 and April 30, 2024, marketable securities of 272.6 million and 254.4 million, respectively, included equity securities of 232.8 million (net of gross unrealized gains of 41.2 million and gross unrealized losses of 0.8 million) and 219.9 million (net of gross unrealized gains of 27.0 million and gross unrealized losses of 1.2 million), respectively, and were held in trust for settlement of our obligations under certain deferred compensation plans, of which 218.3 million and 202.5 million, respectively, are classified as non-current. These marketable securities were held to satisfy vested obligations totaling 215.4 million and 198.6 million as of October 31, 2024 and April 30, 2024, respectively. Unvested obligations under the deferred compensation plans totaled 19.6 million and 22.4 million as of October 31, 2024 and April 30, 2024, respectively. 
 38 

The net increase in our working capital of 25.0 million as of October 31, 2024 compared to April 30, 2024 is primarily attributable to decreases in compensation and benefit payable, other accrued liabilities and income taxes payable and increases in accounts receivable, and income taxes and other receivables, partially offset by a decrease in cash and cash equivalents. The decrease in compensation and benefits payable and cash and cash equivalents was primarily due to payments of annual bonuses earned in fiscal 2024 and paid during the first quarter of fiscal 2025. Other accrued liabilities decreased due to a decrease in deferred revenue due to lower fee revenue in the six months ended October 31, 2024 compared to the six months ended April 30, 2024. The increase in accounts receivable is due to an increase in days of sales outstanding, which went from 58 days to 65 days (which is consistent with historical experience). Income taxes and other receivables increased and income tax payable decreased due to tax payments made in the six months ended October 31, 2024 compared to the six months ended April 30, 2024. Cash used in operating activities was 105.2 million in the six months ended October 31, 2024 compared to 141.9 million in the six months ended October 31, 2023. 
 Cash used in investing activities was 36.3 million in the six months ended October 31, 2024 compared to 22.3 million in the year-ago period. The increase in cash used in investing activities was primarily due to 13.3 million in premiums paid on COLI policies during the six months ended October 31, 2024 compared to 0.2 million in the year-ago period. 
 Cash used in financing activities was 111.1 million in the six months ended October 31, 2024 compared to 38.6 million in the six months ended October 31, 2023. The increase in cash used in financing activities was primarily due to higher repurchases of the Company s common stock of 46.6 million, as well as 20 million more in dividends paid to shareholders during the six months ended October 31, 2024 compared to the year-ago period. Also contributing to the increase were higher payments of tax withholding on restricted stock of 6.4 million in the six months ended October 31, 2024 compared to the year-ago period. 
 Cash Surrender Value of Company-Owned Life Insurance Policies, Net of Loans 
 We purchased COLI policies or contracts insuring the lives of certain employees eligible to participate in the deferred compensation and pension plans as a means of funding benefits under such plans. As of October 31, 2024 and April 30, 2024, we held contracts with gross cash surrender value of 313.4 million and 295.9 million, respectively. Total outstanding borrowings against the CSV of COLI contracts was 76.4 million and 77.0 million as of October 31, 2024 and April 30, 2024, respectively. Such borrowings do not require annual principal repayments, bear interest primarily at variable rates and are secured by the CSV of COLI contracts. At October 31, 2024 and April 30, 2024, the net cash surrender value of these policies was 236.9 million and 219.0 million, respectively. 
 Other than the factors discussed in this section, we are not aware of any other trends, demands or commitments that would materially affect liquidity or those that relate to our resources as of October 31, 2024. 
 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 We have no off-balance sheet arrangements and have not entered into any transactions involving unconsolidated, special purpose entities. We had no material changes in contractual obligations as of October 31, 2024, as compared to those disclosed in our table of contractual obligations included in our Annual Report. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies 
 Preparation of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our condensed financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions and changes in the estimates are reported in current operations as new information is learned or upon the amounts becoming fixed or determinable. In preparing our interim condensed consolidated financial statements and accounting for the underlying transactions and balances, we apply our accounting policies as disclosed in the notes to our condensed consolidated financial statements and in Form 10-K. There have been no material changes in our critical accounting policies since the end of fiscal 2024. 
 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 As a result of our global operating activities, we are exposed to certain market risks, including foreign currency exchange fluctuations and fluctuations in interest rates. We manage our exposure to these risks in the normal course of our business as described below. 
 Foreign Currency Risk 
 Substantially all our foreign subsidiaries operations are measured in their local currencies. Assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars at the rates of exchange in effect at the end of each reporting period and revenue and expenses are translated at daily rates of exchange during the reporting period. Resulting translation adjustments are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss, net on our condensed consolidated balance sheets. 
 39 

Transactions denominated in a currency other than the reporting entity s functional currency may give rise to foreign currency gains or losses that impact our results of operations. Historically, we have not realized significant foreign currency gains or losses on such transactions. During the six months ended October 31, 2024 and 2023, we recorded foreign currency losses of 1.1 million and 1.5 million, respectively, in general and administrative expenses in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. 
 Our exposure to foreign currency exchange rates is driven by fluctuations involving most major global currencies. Based on the ten largest exposure balances as of October 31, 2024 by notional value, a 10 increase or decrease in the value of these currencies could result in a foreign exchange gain or loss of 15.4 million. We have a program that primarily utilizes foreign currency forward contracts to offset the risks associated with the effects of certain foreign currency exposures. These foreign currency forward contracts are neither used for trading purposes nor are they designated as hedging instruments pursuant to Accounting Standards Codification 815, Derivatives and Hedging . 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 Our exposure to interest rate risk is limited to our Credit Facilities, borrowings against the CSV of COLI contracts and to a lesser extent our fixed income debt securities. As of October 31, 2024, there were no amounts outstanding under the Credit Facilities. At our option, loans issued under the Amended Credit Agreement bear interest at either Term SOFR or an alternate base rate, in each case plus the applicable interest rate margin. The interest rate applicable to loans outstanding under the Amended Credit Agreement may fluctuate between Term SOFR plus a SOFR adjustment of 0.10 , plus 1.125 per annum to 2.00 per annum, in the case of Term SOFR borrowings (or between the alternate base rate plus 0.125 per annum and the alternate base rate plus 1.00 per annum, in the alternative), based upon our total funded debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio (as set forth in the Amended Credit Agreement, the consolidated net leverage ratio at such time. In addition, we are required to pay the lenders a quarterly commitment fee ranging from 0.175 to 0.300 per annum on the average daily unused amount of the Revolver, based upon our consolidated net leverage ratio at such time, and fees relating to the issuance of letters of credit. 
 We had 76.4 million and 77.0 million of borrowings against the CSV of COLI contracts as of October 31, 2024 and April 30, 2024, respectively, bearing interest primarily at variable rates. We have sought to minimize the risk of fluctuations in these variable rates by the fact that we receive a corresponding adjustment to our borrowed funds crediting rate, which has the effect of increasing the CSV on our COLI contracts. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures. 
 As of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, management, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting. Based on their evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures conducted as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act )) were effective as of October 31, 2024. 
 b) Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting. 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the three months ended October 31, 2024 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.

 In our Form 10-K, we described the material factors, events, and uncertainties that make an investment in our securities risky. Those risk factors should be considered carefully, together with all other information in that Form 10-K and our subsequent filings with the SEC. It does not address all of the risks that we face, and additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also arise and impair our business operations. As of the date of this report, there have been no material changes to the risk factors described in our Form 10-K.

Furthermore, our Notes allow the Company to pay 25.0 million of dividends per fiscal year with no restrictions plus an unlimited amount of dividends so long as the Company s consolidated total leverage ratio is not greater than 3.50 to 1.00 and the Company is not in default under the indenture governing the Notes.
