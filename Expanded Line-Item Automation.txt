 Expanded Line-Item Automation
Operating Income & Margins: Extract tags like OperatingIncomeLoss to calculate historic and implied EBIT margins.

Depreciation & Amortization: Pull DepreciationAndAmortization for non-cash adjustments.

Capital Expenditures: Use CapitalExpenditures series to differentiate maintenance vs. growth capex.

Working Capital Dynamics: Fetch receivables, inventory and payables to compute Δ Working Capital automatically.

2. Automated WACC Calculation
Cost of Equity: Pull company beta (via XBRL’s Beta tag or an external finance API) and apply CAPM using a live risk-free rate.

Cost of Debt: Derive from tags like LongTermDebtInterestExpense and current debt balances.

Capital Structure Weights: Use Liabilities and StockholdersEquity to compute target debt/equity mix.

3. Scenario & Sensitivity Analysis
Multi-Scenario Forecasts: Allow users to define “Base,” “Upside,” and “Downside” case assumptions side-by-side.

Tornado Charts: Visualize how changes in key drivers (growth rate, margin, WACC) impact fair value.

Monte Carlo Simulation: Run randomized draws around input distributions to quantify valuation ranges.

4. Terminal Value Methods
Multiple Approaches: Support both Gordon Growth and Exit Multiple methods.

Live Multiples: Pull peer group EV/EBITDA or P/E multiples via an external API for benchmarking.

5. Per-Share & Relative Metrics
Share Count Integration: Pull WeightedAverageNumberOfSharesOutstandingBasic for per-share valuation.

Peer Comparison: On-the-fly peer-group multiples and valuation multiples table.

6. Interactive Data Visualization
Time-Series Charts: Plot revenue, EBITDA, free cash flow and WACC over historical and forecast periods.

Waterfall Plots: Illustrate step-by-step contributor analysis to valuation (e.g., growth vs. margin).

7. Model Management & Export
Template Selection: Offer different DCF templates (e.g., “High-Growth Tech” vs. “Mature Industrials”).

Versioning: Save and compare previous model runs.

Advanced Exports: Generate a fully-formatted Excel workbook (with assumption tabs, growth schedules, charts).

8. Custom Assumption Libraries
Assumption Presets: Preload industry-specific default growth/margin profiles.

User Profiles: Save and recall custom assumption sets across sessions.

9. Alerts & Reporting
Valuation Alerts: Notify when fair value falls outside a user-defined range.

Email/PDF Reports: Automate delivery of key outputs and charts.
