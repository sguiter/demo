        "This tutorial shows how to download and scrape 10-K filings from SEC EDGAR to your local disk. We use Python 3 and the SEC-API.io Python package to help us find the links to all 10-K filings on EDGAR and then download them.\n",
        "\n",
        "Our SEC filings download application will be structured into two components:\n",
        "1. The first component of our Python application finds all URLs of  10-K filings on EDGAR filed between 1995 and 2022. We also consider older 10-K variants, that is 10-KT, 10KSB, 10KT405, 10KSB40, 10-K405. Our application also includes all amended/changed filings, for example 10-K/A. Once we generated a complete list of all URLs of 10-K filings, we're going to save the list to a file to our hard disk.\n",
        "2. The second component reads the URLs from the file, and downloads all annual reports. We download up to 30 filings in parallel using the Render API of the SEC-API package and use Pythons multiprocessing package to speed up the download process."
